    "input": "Whether a sign of a good read; or a comment on the 'pulp' nature of some genres of fiction, the Oxfam second-hand book charts have remained in The Da Vinci Code author's favour for the past four years. \n \n Dan Brown has topped Oxfam's 'most donated' list again, his fourth consecutive year. Having sold more than 80 million copies of The Da Vinci Code and had all four of his novels on the New York Times bestseller list in the same week, it's hardly surprising that Brown's hefty tomes are being donated to charity by readers keen to make some room on their shelves. \n \n Another cult crime writer responsible to heavy-weight hardbacks, Stieg Larsson, is Oxfam's 'most sold' author for the second time in a row. Both the 'most donated' and 'most sold' lists are dominated by crime fiction, trilogies and fantasy, with JK Rowling the only female author listed in either of the Top Fives. \n \n Click here or on \"View Gallery\" to see both charts in pictures ||||| A woman reads a copy of the newly released book ''The Lost Symbol'' by Dan Brown, at a speed reading book launch event in Sydney, September 15, 2009. REUTERS/Tim Wimborne \n \n SAN FRANCISCO The latest novel from \"Da Vinci Code\" author Dan Brown, \"The Lost Symbol,\" broke one-day sales records, its publisher and booksellers said. \n \n Readers snapped up over one million hardcover copies across the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom after it was released on Tuesday, said publisher Knopf Doubleday, a division of Random House Inc. \n \n \"We are seeing historic, record-breaking sales across all types of our accounts in North America for 'The Lost Symbol,\" said Sonny Mehta, editor in chief of Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Knopf Doubleday is a division of Random House Inc. \n \n Amazon.com Inc, the world's largest online retailer, called the book its bestselling first-day adult fiction title ever, including pre-orders. \n \n Barnes & Noble Inc said \"The Lost Symbol\" broke its previous one-day sales record for adult fiction. \n \n The success of the Dan Brown's latest is a boost to publisher Knopf Doubleday and booksellers, which have endured sliding sales in the midst of the recession. \n \n Booksellers have anxiously awaited a popular title that will resonate with readers and fuel the same sort of frenzy seen earlier this decade with the \"Harry Potter\" series, from author J.K. Rowling. \n \n But the $25 billion domestic book market has wallowed in a slump in recent years as more readers make their purchases online, or forego books altogether for online games and other forms of media and entertainment. \n \n Now, digital books and electronic reading devices such as Amazon's Kindle or Sony Corp's Reader are seen as both avenues of growth and sources of competition for traditional media, and publishers and booksellers are scrambling to respond. \n \n The highly anticipated book from Brown comes six years after the release of the American novelist's last book \"The Da Vinci Code\". It follows the adventures of Harvard professor Robert Langdon and is set in the secret world of Freemasons in Washington D.C. \n \n \"The Da Vinci Code\" sold 80 million copies worldwide. It was made into a film starring Tom Hanks that grossed more than $758 million, according to tracking firm Box Office Mojo. \n \n Shares of Amazon closed up $7.15 to $90.70 on the Nasdaq. Amazon was upgraded to a \"Buy\" rating by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, which cited a resurgence in e-commerce that would benefit the Seattle-based company. \n \n Barnes & Noble closed up 14 cents to $22.04 and book retailer Borders Group Inc closed up 2 cents to $3.29, on the New York Stock Exchange. \n \n (Reporting by Alexandria Sage; editing by Carol Bishopric) ||||| Bestselling author is also the most frequently given away to charity shops \n \n Dan Brown might be one of the world's bestselling authors but it turns out that readers aren't too keen on keeping his special blend of religious conspiracy and scholarly derring-do on their shelves once they've bought it. \n \n Brown, who has sold more than 81m copies of The Da Vinci Code worldwide, has been revealed as the most donated author to Oxfam's 700 high street shops. With just four books to his name \u2013 although his long-awaited fifth The Lost Symbol is published next month \u2013 Brown did well to see off competition from John Grisham, author of more than 20 and the second-most likely writer to be ditched in a charity shop by readers. \n \n But as secondhand bookshop shelves flood with battered editions of Angels and Demons and Digital Fortress, Brown can comfort himself with the fact that he's also Oxfam's second most bought author: there are, apparently, still readers out there who have yet to follow the adventures of the dapper symbologist Robert Langdon. There's no such consolation for Grisham, whose legal thrillers fail to make Oxfam's bestseller charts at all. \n \n \"There's no question that when you go into the back room of Oxfam shops there are many Dan Brown books,\" said Oxfam's director of trading David McCullough. \"But he's also very high on the bestseller list so there is a useful recycling exercise going on \u2013 it's not just people saying 'I've read The Da Vinci Code and now I must get rid of it'.\" \n \n Ian Rankin, whose dour, boozy detective John Rebus is no Robert Langdon, tops Oxfam's bestseller list, which the charity says is the first ever high-street secondhand bestseller chart. \"It's always good for an author to know that their books are popular,\" said the Scottish author, who will unveil a new policeman hero, the teetotal Malcolm Fox, next month. \"With Oxfam, it's also heartening to realise that each book donated and bought is helping such a worthwhile organisation.\" \n \n Stephenie Meyer, author of the Twilight series and instigator of myriad teenage crushes courtesy of her sparkly vampire hero Edward Cullen, is also sitting high in Oxfam's charts, nestling between Bernard Cornwell and Terry Pratchett. \n \n Margaret Atwood, meanwhile, winner of the Booker prize and author of a host of critically acclaimed works of fiction, scrapes into the list in eighth place, keeping unlikely company with thriller powerhouse James Patterson \u2013 currently producing at least eight books a year thanks to a horde of co-writers \u2013 and Jodi Picoult, never afraid to jerk a tear or pile on the plot twists. \n \n \"We just need to dispel the idea that we are sitting there in Oxfam with only first editions of literary gems \u2013 actually we've got shelves of really good fiction,\" said McCullough. \"Waterstone's might be more upset than secondhand booksellers,\" he added, referring to the recent slew of complaints from secondhand booksellers that the charity is stealing their business. \n \n Oxfam, Europe's biggest high-street retailer of secondhand books and the third-biggest bookseller in the UK, launched a drive for book donations in May ahead of its first national book festival, Bookfest, in July. Authors including Joanna Trollope, Philip Pullman and Jonathan Coe all lent a hand in shops across the country as part of the festival, and the drive saw book donations rise 40%, with sales up by more than 10%. \n \n Rare books and first editions have also been pouring into shops since May. Ten of the most sought-after editions have raised more than \u00a34,500 for the charity between them. A first edition of Lord of the Rings sold for \u00a3800, a first edition of Watership Down brought in \u00a3500, Sylvia Plath's Ariel sold for \u00a3350, Ian Fleming's From Russia With Love for \u00a3300 and a second printing of Martin Chuzzlewit for \u00a3200. \n \n Oxfam, which has more than 130 specialist bookshops and stocks books in almost all of its 700 stores, sells \u00a31.6m-worth of books a month \u2013 equivalent, it says, to 50,000 emergency shelters, 64,000 goats or safe water for 2.1 million people. \n \n The most donated authors to Oxfam shops so far this year: \n \n 1.

    "reference": "\u2013 The Da Vinci Code has sold so many copies\u2014that would be at least 80 million\u2014that it's bound to turn up in book donation piles. But at one charity shop in the UK, it's been donated so heavily that the shop has posted a sign propped up on a tower of Da Vinci Code copies that reads: \"You could give us another Da Vinci Code... but we would rather have your vinyl!\" The manager of the Oxfam shop in Swansea tells the Telegraph that people are laughing and taking pictures of the sizable display: \"I would say that we get one copy of the book every day.\" He says people buy them \"occasionally,\" but with vinyl sales up 25% in the past year, they'd rather take records. Dan Brown's book isn't the only one that shops like Oxfam struggle to re-sell. Last year, Oxfam was hit with a large and steady supply of Fifty Shades of Grey, and it similarly begged donors: \"Please\u2014no more.\" But Brown has a particular kind of staying power. The Da Vinci Code was published in 2003, and within six years Brown had booted John Grisham from the No. 1 slot on the list of writers whose books were most often donated to Oxfam's 700 shops, reported the Guardian at the time. The Independent in 2012 reported Brown's best-seller was the most-donated book for the fourth year running. (See why Dan Brown took heat from the Philippines.)"

    "input": "The deaths of three American soldiers in Afghanistan this week are a tragic reminder of why it\u2019s so important for the nation to keep its promises to military men and women, Veterans, no matter where they served, have volunteered to put their lives on the line \u2014 and some make the ultimate sacrifice. Those courageous enough to go into battle should face zero delays in getting the education benefits they\u2019ve earned. \n \n Unfortunately, financial aid has been late or gone AWOL this fall for thousands of veterans and their families relying on the GI Bill to get through school. The reason: a big information-technology glitch that surfaced with what seemed like a relatively minor change in how the aid is calculated. \n \n While the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is trying to fix this, a lack of communication by the agency about the delays, coupled with inaction by the U.S. Senate, has left service members-turned-students facing severe financial hardships. This week, the agency was still working to process more than 58,000 student aid claims. \n \n On Wednesday, the VA announced that the information technology fixes will not be completed until December 2019 \u2014 more than a year past the original Aug. 1 deadline for finishing this work. This is a national disgrace, one that should prompt congressional leadership to move quickly on short- and long-term solutions. A good start would be swift passage of a Senate bill that would prohibit schools from penalizing student veterans for late VA assistance payments. This would address a major concern that students with accounts in arrears due to delayed payments may not be allowed to enroll for 2019 coursework. Given that the VA has said the tech problems will continue until the end of 2019, this protection is a sensible step. \n \n The House merits praise for unanimously passing hold-students-harmless legislation, which has been dubbed the \u201cSIT-REP\u201d bill. But the legislation is bogged down in the Senate. \n \n \u201cIf ever there was a time that it was obvious this bill needed to be passed, now is the time,\u201d said Tanya Ang, vice president of the Veterans Education Success organization, in a statement provided for a Nov. 15 House Veterans Affairs subcommittee hearing. \n \n Other testimony provided at the hearing made it clear that long-term solutions are urgently needed, too. The VA has lacked a permanent chief information officer since January 2017, which is unacceptable given how technology is so critical to delivering service members\u2019 benefits. \n \n President Donald Trump nominated a well-qualified Minnesota native, James Gfrerer, last summer, but the Senate has yet to confirm him. The Senate is expected to take this up soon, but the delay is inexcusable. \n \n Both houses of Congress also need to scrutinize a much larger problem \u2014 the antiquated IT systems relied on by the VA and other federal agencies. A statement provided to the House by Booz Allen Hamilton, the private contractor originally hired to update the VA system, makes clear the root of the GI Bill problem: \u201cThe unfortunate delay has been caused by the confluence of outdated systems being asked to perform ever complex tasks.\u201d \n \n A 2016 Government Accountability Office report put the age of the VA\u2019s benefits delivery platform at more than a half century. At that time, other agencies, such as the Treasury Department, also had so-called \u201clegacy systems\u201d in that age range. \u201cMany use outdated software and hardware parts that are unsupported,\u201d the report warned. \n \n The GI Bill delay shows how a tweak to these dated systems can be complicated and time-consuming. There\u2019s likely little appetite in Congress to tackle the daunting task of modernization, but leadership is sorely needed. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n Nov. 29, 2018, 1:40 AM GMT / Updated Nov. 29, 2018, 1:52 AM GMT By Phil McCausland \n \n For weeks, student veterans across the country have raised an alarm about delayed or incorrect GI Bill benefit payments, which the Department of Veterans Affairs has blamed on computer issues. \n \n But on Wednesday, the department told congressional staffers that it would not reimburse those veterans who were paid less than they were owed, two committee aides told NBC News. \n \n The news conflicts with a promise VA officials made to a House committee earlier this month that it would reimburse those veterans who received less than the full amount they were due. \n \n According to the aides, however, the VA said it could not make retroactive payments without auditing its previous education claims, which it said would delay future claims. The aides asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. \n \n NBC News previously reported that some veterans were forced into desperate financial straits stemming from a change in calculating housing allowances under the Forever GI Bill, which President Donald Trump signed into law in July 2017. When its computers were unable to process that change, the VA quickly faced a backlog of veterans\u2019 claims three times higher than normal. \n \n Because of those issues, the VA had announced earlier on Wednesday that it would delay the Forever GI Bill housing allowance changes until December 2019 \u2014 and again promised that retroactive payments would be made to those who did not receive a correct amount. \n \n But VA officials told congressional staffers in a telephone call on Wednesday morning that once the system is made right next year, they will not make retroactive payments to those who were underpaid because of the housing miscalculations. \n \n \"They are essentially going to ignore the law and say that that change only goes forward from December 2019,\" one aide told NBC News. \n \n The reason the VA decided that it would not make the retroactive payments is because it would have to audit all its previous education claims prior to December 2019, meaning the VA would potentially have to inspect 2 million claims, the aide said. \n \n VA officials said this could cause further delays in processing future claims, according to the aides, an issue that caused some veterans to suffer earlier this year. \n \n While this decision could mean the agency is flouting the law because it would not provide the correct amount of money to student veterans as required by two sections of the Forever GI Bill, the VA told the congressional staffers that they have a legal justification that would allow them to move forward with this decision. \n \n They did not share that justification, however. \n \n When asked for comment, a VA spokesman did not address the issue directly. Instead he reiterated that the agency would delay paying housing allowances in accordance with the new Forever GI Bill until the spring term of 2020 and instead pay housing allowances based on Department of Defense's older Basic Housing Allowance rates. \n \n Attempting to implement the law would put \u201can enormous administrative burden for schools in which some 35,000 certifying officials would have to track retroactively and re-certify hundreds of thousands of enrollment documents,\u201d Curtis Cashour, the VA spokesman, said over email. \n \n Cashour also said that students who were overpaid because of the law\u2019s changes or because of issues in implementing the law \u201cwill not be held liable for the debt.\u201d \n \n But he did not comment on those who were underpaid and rampant confusion continues to surround the issue, as it is unknown how many students have been underpaid thus far, how many more could be underpaid because of the changes to the law and how much money these veterans are owed. \n \n Congressional aides described the situation as \u201cfrustrating.\u201d One, who commented on the shifting answers and constant confusion stemming from VA, asked, \u201cI mean, am I taking crazy pills?\u201d \n \n Under Secretary for Benefits Paul Lawrence is scheduled to testify Thursday morning before the House Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs. \n \n One of the committee aides said that members of Congress will attempt to clear this issue up before they move forward with the hearing. \n \n \u201cThey need to figure it out,\u201d the aide said. ||||| After blowing through the initial deadline to bring its GI Bill housing stipends in line with the Forever GI Bill law, Veterans Affairs Department officials said Wednesday that they will not be able to implement the fix until December 2019. \n \n The big delay comes after months of technology hiccups that have plagued the agency, which failed to meet the original Aug. 1 deadline to put the changes in place. These problems have contributed to a backlog of claims for veterans using the Post-9/11 GI Bill to attend school this fall, and the agency has come under fire in recent months as thousands of student veterans have had to wait longer than usual for their tuition and housing payments. \n \n \u201cRedesigning the way (Veterans Benefits Administration) calculates Post-9/11 GI Bill housing rates during a busy academic season was like flying a plane while building it, and that was unfair and frustrating to veterans and taxpayers. That\u2019s why we are resetting our implementation of the law for the next year to ensure we get the technology and formula right to put Veterans first,\u201d VA Sec. Robert Wilkie said in a news release. \u201cIn the meantime, beneficiaries receiving Post 9/11 GI Bill housing allowances will be paid at the DoD (basic housing allowance) rate, which in many cases will be equal to or higher than their current payment.\u201d \n \n Rebootcamp Recommendations \n \n Congressional leaders who have taken the VA to task for the slow implementation said Wednesday they are glad Wilkie is choosing to focus on getting student veterans their payments, even if it means pushing back the deadline for the IT updates to be completed. \n \n \u201cWhile I am disappointed that the VA does not yet have an effective IT system in place, I understand Secretary Wilkie\u2019s decision to reset implementation of certain sections of the \u2018Forever\u2019 GI Bill while improvements continue to be made,\u201d Senate Committee on Veterans\u2019 Affairs Chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., said in a statement. \u201cRight now, the VA\u2019s priority must be to ensure accurate payments are sent to student veterans in a timely manner. Student veterans rely on the GI Bill to support themselves and their families while they are in school, and the VA is responsible for keeping those payments going, even as it implements the new law.\u201d \n \n Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., whose House Committee on Veterans Affairs\u2019 pressed VA leaders for a new deadline in a hearing on Capitol Hill earlier this month, said Wilkie\u2019s move \u201cwill ensure that monthly housing payments are made with minimal delays.\u201d \n \n Both lawmakers said they would continue their efforts to hold the VA accountable. ||||| CLOSE Dr. Hilary Miller of MTSU works with veteran students on the GI Bill that are affected by VA technical difficulties Mark Zaleski and Michael Schwab \n \n Staff Sergeant Robert Baker and his family have been affected by VA tech issues that has delayed GI Bill Benefits for months (Photo: Submitted) \n \n Staff Sgt. Robert Baker was so stressed about money that he made a \u201cspur of the moment decision\u201d and dropped out of all his classes. \n \n It was already October and he hadn\u2019t received his GI Bill benefits for the start of his fall semester at Austin Peay State University in Clarksville. \n \n The 30-year-old communications major and his wife, in her last semester of nursing school, are full-time students. At home, they have three young kids, ages 2 to 6. \n \n \u201cI freaked out,\u201d Baker said in an interview with the USA TODAY NETWORK - Tennessee. \u201cI told them I was going to fall behind on my mortgage. I was expecting to be paid by the VA, but since it wasn\u2019t happening, I needed to get to work.\u201d \n \n His wife had already picked up a second job bartending to make ends meet. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re too young to know about the money aspect, but they know mommy is gone so much,\u201d Baker said of his kids, who he watches at alone at night after a day of classes. \u201cThey were feeling our stress.\u201d \n \n Baker left the Army this summer after 12 years in the service, including deployments to Iraq in 2008 and Kuwait in 2012. He was stationed in Fort Campbell for four years. \n \n He wanted to take advantage of his GI Bill so he enrolled for classes just a month after the Army discharged him. But the money never came, he said. \n \n \"We were just shocked. We were angry because we figured this would be automatic,\" Baker said. \"Come to find out, there were big problems going on at the VA.\" \n \n There are many veterans, like Baker, in Tennessee and across the country who are still waiting for the Department of Veterans Affairs to clear a backlog created after President Donald Trump signed the Forever GI BIll in 2017. \n \n While the landmark legislation expanded benefits for a new generation of veterans and their families, it didn\u2019t upgrade the VA\u2019s antiquated technical capabilities to account for those changes. \n \n Problems are centered within the VA\u2019s Office of Information Technology, which is tasked with implementing the change to how housing allowances are calculated, the VA said. \n \n The new bill changed it so that veterans housing would be based on the school\u2019s ZIP code, rather that where the veteran lived. Problems arose when the VA attempted to stress test their outdated system, as well as a contract dispute. As a result, the VA waited until July 16 to tell schools to begin enrolling students. \n \n The delay caused a backlog of claims, meaning thousands of students had to wait for their benefits just as they were headed back to school for the fall semester. Post-Sept. 11 military-affiliated students, particularly first-time students like Baker, were mostly impacted. \n \n On Nov. 14, state Rep. Jay Reedy, R-Erin, and leaders in the Tennessee House and Senate wrote a letter to U.S. Rep. Phil Roe, R-Johnson City, and members of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs urging them to take immediate action. Roe chairs the committee. \n \n Nationally there are fewer than 1,000 Veterans who have an education claim that has been pending over 60 days and less than 10,000 who have a claim that\u2019s been pending for over 30 days, as of Nov. 28, according to VA spokesman Curt Cashour. \n \n Universities step in to help students \n \n But where the VA failed, universities across the state have stepped up to help students. \n \n Many schools are utilizing 0 percent interest loans and tuition deferment as ways to ensure student veterans receive the financial support they need continue their education. \n \n As a result, institutional funds at several schools have been heavily drawn down, creating budget concerns. \n \n Baker said after he dropped his classes, he came to the realization that he would have to pay the school back for the months he's already been in class. \n \n \"It was just going to hurt me more financially. I was freaking out and called admissions,\" he said. \"They said 'It's OK. We'll fix it.'\" \n \n APSU has some 2,400 military-affiliated students on campus, according to retired Brig. Gen. Scott Brower, who joined the institution this year as its first military adviser in residence. \n \n About $960,000 in tuition was deferred by the university for students impacted by the delay, and 83 students have taken out short-term loans offered by the school, totaling $175,000, according to Brower. \n \n \"We recognize this is on the VA and that they will fix this problem. We've been treating it with good faith, knowing that money is not available for them right now,\" he said. \"We want to make sure we are doing everything we can so that students are continuing on their goal for degree completion.\" \n \n Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro has done the same for its students, according to Hilary Miller, the director of the Daniels Center, a resource for the nearly 1,100 veterans and military families on campus. \n \n \u201cIt was terrible,\u201d she said, speaking of the delays.

(Photo: Mark Zaleski /For The Tennessean) \n \n Miller said the school deferred their tuition and had short-term loans available for students to hold them over until their benefits had been processed. The school also had template letters for students to use with landlords explaining their situation. \n \n \u201cWe asked our community members to extend grace to our veterans and that this was nothing the veterans did,\u201d she said. \n \n Students reached out to say that they couldn't pay for books and that it impacted their productivity in the classroom. The school contacted staff and faculty to make sure they were aware of the situation and asked if they could make copies of textbook pages in certain cases. \n \n \"We did everything we could do to make it easier, but if you're not getting paid for a couple of months, there's not a lot we can do to make it easier,\" Miller said. \n \n VA's 'alarm' didn't go off \n \n The delays varied greatly for students at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City. Some students were processed within 72 hours, but in many cases, students had to wait months to see any money. \n \n \u201cWe were calling a month later, then two months later and (the VA) said. \u2018We meant to get to that,\u2019\u201d said Antonio Banchs, the director of veterans affairs at East Tennessee State. \n \n \u201cIt was as if they put in an alarm clock or something,\" Banchs said. \"But it never went off.\u201d \n \n As of mid-November, Banchs said all of the roughly 1,000 veteran-affiliated students on campus had at last received their benefits. But it came with costs. \n \n \u201cSome were put in a financial hardship,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially our first-time students who went through a more rigorous process.\u201d \n \n Buy Photo Middle Tennessee State University Veterans and Military Family Center director, Dr. Hilary Miller talks with geo science student and former United State Marine Corps Sgt.

The institution also used the summer to train staff. \n \n \"We started at that time really trying to ramp up what we are doing,\" Miller said. \"I think we mitigated a lot of the problem before it happened.\" \n \n Ten students are left to be paid as of mid-November. Miller said she is concerned that nothing has changed for the new spring semester and that the VA hasn't provided any clarity. \n \n \"We're not really sure what's going to happen.

    "reference": "\u2013 A major snafu has hit benefit payments to student veterans under the GI Bill\u2014and congressional aides tells NBC that they have been told the veterans are never going to be paid back. The aides say they were told by the Department of Veterans Affairs that the VA will not be making retroactive payments to veterans who were underpaid for their housing allowance because it would mean reviewing around 2 millions claims, further delaying implementation of a new system, which has already been pushed back to Dec. 2019. Under the Forever GI Bill signed into law by President Trump last year, students are supposed to be paid housing allowance based on where they take the most classes, not on where the school's main campus is located. Tanya Ang, vice president of Veterans Education Success, tells the Military Times that the VA's excuse of retroactive payments creating too much work isn't good enough. \"That could be hundreds of dollars for some students\u2014per month,\" she says. \"If this was a disability benefit, this would never fly.\" The issue, which is the result of new legislation being introduced before the VA's outdated computer system could handle it, has contributed to a backlog of claims that has forced some veterans facing financial hardship to abandon their studies, the Tennessean reports. The agency is still working to process more than 58,000 claims, reports the Star Tribune. The paper's editorial board calls the delays a \"national disgrace.\" \"Those courageous enough to go into battle should face zero delays in getting the education benefits they\u2019ve earned,\" they write."

    "input": "DUBAI Al Qaeda in Yemen has claimed responsibility for the attack on the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, saying it was ordered by the Islamist militant group's leadership for insults to the Prophet Mohammad, according to a video posted on YouTube. \n \n Gunmen killed 17 people in three days of violence that began when they shot staff in Charlie Hebdo's offices last week in revenge for the publication of satirical images of the Prophet. \n \n One Western source said no hard evidence of a direct operational link to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) had yet been found. \n \n But it was the first time that a group had officially claimed responsibility for the attack, which was led by Cherif and Said Kouachi, two French-born brothers of Algerian extraction who had visited Yemen in 2011. \n \n In Washington, a State Department spokeswoman said the United States believed the video was authentic but officials were still determining if the claim of responsibility is true. \n \n \"As for the blessed Battle of Paris, we...claim responsibility for this operation as vengeance for the Messenger of God,\" Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, an AQAP ideologue, said in the recording. \n \n Ansi said the \"one who chose the target, laid the plan and financed the operation is the leadership of the organization\", without naming an individual. \n \n \"ZAWAHRI'S ORDERS\" \n \n He added that the strike had been carried out in \"implementation\" of the order of overall al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri, who has urged Muslims to attack the West using any means they can find. \n \n Ansi also gave credit for the operation to slain AQAP propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, a preacher cited by one of the gunmen in remarks to French media as a financier of the attack. \n \n It was not clear how Awlaki, killed by a U.S. drone in 2011, had a direct link to the Paris assault, but he inspired several militants in the United States and Britain to acts of violence. \n \n The purported claim of responsibility put a new spotlight on a group often cited by Western officials as al Qaeda's most dangerous branch. AQAP has recently focused on fighting government forces and Shi'ite rebels in Yemen, but says it still aims to carry out attacks abroad. \n \n AQAP mocked a huge rally of solidarity for the victims held in Paris on Sunday, saying the shock on display showed the feebleness of the Western leaders who attended. \n \n \"Look at how they gathered, rallied and supported each other, strengthening their weakness and dressing their wounds,\" it said. \n \n Al Qaeda offshoot Islamic State released a video that it said showed interviews with three French fighters in Syria praising the attacks, the SITE monitoring service reported. \n \n One said: \"I say to the French people who think that the Islamic State will not reach Europe: With permission from Allah the Almighty, we will reach Europe \u2013 all of Europe.\" \n \n \"JOY AT TORMENT\" \n \n SITE also said Nigeria's Boko Haram group had released a video showing its leader welcoming the attacks. \u201cWe have felt joy for what befell the people of France in terms of torment, as their blood was spilled inside their country. Allah is Great!\" Abubakar Shekau said in the recording, according to SITE. \n \n One Western source described Ansi as an Al Qaeda hawk reputed to have advocated a merger with the even more hardline Islamic State. \n \n Two senior Yemeni sources said Cherif and Said Kouachi had met Awlaki in Yemen and undergone weapons training in the eastern province of Marib. However, a Marib tribal leader denied that they had trained there in 2011 or that Awlaki had been based there. \n \n AQAP's Yemeni leader, Nasser al-Wuhayshi, was once a close associate of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, whose father was born in Yemen, a neighbor of Saudi Arabia. \n \n Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi complained on Wednesday that Yemen had been subjected to a politicized media campaign over the alleged 2011 visit. \n \n \"The person reported to have traveled to Yemen to learn in three days how to fire a pistol had been detained and under investigation for two years in France,\" Hadi said, according to the state news agency Saba. Hadi asked why such suspicious elements had been allowed to travel to Yemen and return home without being questioned. \n \n (Reporting by Ahmed Tolba in Cairo, Yara Bayoumy in Dubai, Mohammed Ghobari in Sanaa and Lesley Wroughton and Doina Chiacu in Washington, Editing by William Maclean, Dominic Evans and Kevin Liffey) ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from a kiosk in Paris as people queue to buy the latest issue \n \n Millions more copies of French weekly Charlie Hebdo are being printed after the first run sold out in hours. \n \n The normal print run of 60,000 was extended to five million - a week after Islamist gunmen murdered 12 people at the magazine's offices and five others in subsequent attacks in Paris. \n \n The \"survivors' issue\" has angered some Muslims by depicting the Prophet Muhammad on its cover. \n \n A video purportedly from al-Qaeda in Yemen said it planned the Hebdo attack. \n \n US state department spokeswoman Marie Harf said they believed the video was authentic but could not determine if its claims were true. \n \n The group, AQAP, had previously welcomed the attack, without acknowledging any role in the operation. \n \n The gunmen are said to have used earlier publication of images of the Prophet as justification for their attack on the magazine. \n \n Charlie Hebdo's latest cover shows a cartoon depicting the Prophet Muhammad weeping while holding a sign saying \"I am Charlie\", and below the headline \"All is forgiven\". \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption People waited for kiosks to open to buy the magazine \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption All copies of the magazine were sold out by Wednesday morning at this Paris newsstand \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Some kiosks said they had received dozens of reservation requests \n \n \"I am Charlie\" emerged as a message of support for the magazine following the attack on 7 January, which left eight journalists, including its editor, dead in addition to four others. \n \n In a separate attack in Paris two days later, an Islamist gunman killed four Jewish men and took hostages at a kosher shop. \n \n The same attacker is believed to have shot a policewoman the day before. \n \n 'Charlie is alive' \n \n Normally Charlie Hebdo prints 60,000 copies but the planned run increased steadily this week - from one million to three million to five million. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Charlie Hebdo editor-in-chief Gerard Biard comforted Renald \"Luz\" Luzier, who drew the latest cover, at a news conference \n \n The \"survivors' issue\", as the magazine calls it, is available in six languages including English, Arabic and Turkish. Proceeds are going to victims' families. \n \n President Francois Hollande has insisted the magazine and its values will continue. \n \n \"Charlie Hebdo is alive and will live on,\" he said. \"You can assassinate men and women but you will never kill their ideas.\" \n \n Charlie Hebdo's decision to publish another cartoon of the Prophet drew threats from militant Islamist websites and criticism from the Islamic world. \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption On Sunday, about 1.5 million people rallied in Paris in a show of solidarity with the victims \n \n The Islamic State (IS) militant group said it was \"an extremely stupid act\". \n \n Meanwhile, a new video apparently from AQAP said the group had planned and financed the Charlie Hebdo attacks in \"vengeance for the Prophet\". \n \n It said it was a \"success\" that the magazine shootings had \"coincided\" with the attacks by supermarket gunman Amedy Coulibaly. \n \n Analysis: BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner \n \n The video purporting to come from AQAP does appear to be genuine but questions remain over just how closely AQAP was really involved in last week's Paris attacks. More than two years have elapsed since Said Kouachi, one of the three gunmen, is believed to have slipped out of Yemen after spending time there with al-Qaeda members, including the extremist preacher Anwar Al-Awlaki. \n \n He is mentioned in the video in connection with the attack planning but Al-Awlaki was killed back in 2011 in a US drone strike so, again, that would be a long time to plan such a relatively simple but devastating attack. \n \n It is also odd that AQAP have not issued any so-called \"martyrdom videos\", showing the perpetrators giving their justifications ahead of the raid. \n \n These may still be to come but for now it seems the connection between the Paris attackers and AQAP is more one of inspiration, ideology and training rather than close direction and leadership. \n \n Were gunmen aided by terror network? \n \n Coulibaly had pledged allegiance to IS in a video message while the Charlie Hebdo attackers, Said and Cherif Kouachi, had said they were acting on behalf of AQAP. \n \n Coulibaly had said they had co-ordinated the attacks but experts say it is highly unlikely IS and AQAP, rivals in the Middle East, would work together. \n \n Meanwhile a lawyer for Said Kouachi's wife, Soumya, has told the BBC she had no idea he was an extremist. He said Kouachi had kissed his wife goodbye and told her he was visiting his brother, because he was unwell, just hours before the Charlie Hebdo attack. \n \n \"It's beyond her understanding, her world has fallen apart,\" the lawyer, Antoine Flasaquier, said. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Soumya Kouachi's lawyer: \"Her husband told her he was going to Paris to see his brother Cherif\" \n \n Ban on distribution \n \n The magazine's release comes after millions - including dozens of world leaders - took part in a unity rally in Paris on Sunday. \n \n Outside France, the Washington Post, Germany's Frankfurter Allgemeine, Corriere della Sera in Italy and the UK's Guardian are among publications that have shown the latest cartoon. \n \n The BBC has published the image in a previous story and in a statement said: \"We have made the editorial judgment that the images are central to reporting the story.\" \n \n Why people are buying the magazine \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why do Parisians say it is important to buy this issue of Charlie Hebdo? \n \n Catherine Boniface, Paris: \"This issue is symbolic, it represents their persistence, they didn't yield in the face of terror.\" \n \n Read more: In the queue for Charlie Hebdo \n \n Read more: Charlie Hebdo's place in French journalism \n \n Read more: The issue of depicting the Prophet Muhammad \n \n Meanwhile, the interior minister of Senegal - whose president took part in the Paris march - has issued an order banning the distribution of the magazine, according to the national news agency. \n \n Comedian arrested \n \n Several hundred people attended the funeral on Wednesday of Michel Renaud, who was killed while visiting Charlie Hebdo's offices. \n \n Ceremonies were held for seven other victims in France and Israel on Tuesday. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption New mobile phone footage shows the Kouachi brothers opening fire on police \n \n Meanwhile, controversial French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala has been arrested for \"defending terrorism\" after he likened himself to gunman Amedy Coulibaly. \n \n A judicial source quoted by AFP news agency said he was due to be released on Wednesday evening but would face trial at a later date. \n \n Police are also investigating some 50 people suspected of \"condoning terrorism\" and 25 cases of people attacking or defacing Muslim places of worship. \n \n How the attacks unfolded (all times GMT) \n \n Wednesday 7 January 10:30 - Two masked gunmen enter Charlie Hebdo offices, killing 11 people, including the magazine's editor.

    "reference": "\u2013 Yemen-based al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has claimed responsibility for the Charlie Hebdo attack in an online video called \"Vengeance for the Prophet: A Message Regarding the Blessed Battle of Paris,\" the New York Times reports. The group says it \"chose the target, laid the plan, and financed the operation\" in \"a vengeance for the messenger of Allah\"\u2014a likely reference to Charlie Hebdo's parodies of the Prophet Muhammad. But while AQAP called the Kouachi brothers \"two heroes of Islam,\" it suggests it wasn't behind the attacks that followed, including on a kosher supermarket. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly's actions were a coincidence, the statement says, calling him simply a \"mujahid brother.\" The Charlie Hebdo attackers claimed to be working for AQAP, while Coulibaly has pledged support for ISIS, the BBC notes. The statement, made by AQAP leader Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, says the attack was an \"implementation\" of orders from Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of the larger al-Qaeda group, Reuters reports.

The data firm that worked for now-President Trump's 2016 campaign became embroiled in controversy following revelations that it misused the Facebook data of millions of people, and Nigel Oakes, the founder of its British affiliate SCL, tells the Wall Street Journal both companies are shutting down. A source says the company was losing clients in the wake of the data harvesting scandal and also faced significant legal fees due to the Facebook investigation. Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix had also been suspended in March after video was released showing him bragging about allegedly influencing elections, among other things.

    "input": "The N.S.A.\u2019s Evolution: The National Security Agency was founded in 1952, and its surveillance capabilities were limited by legislation in 1978. But with the attacks of September 2001 came a new sense of urgency. \n \n When Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, sat down with President Obama at the White House in April to discuss Syrian chemical weapons, Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and climate change , it was a cordial, routine exchange. \n \n The National Security Agency nonetheless went to work in advance and intercepted Mr. Ban\u2019s talking points for the meeting, a feat the agency later reported as an \u201coperational highlight\u201d in a weekly internal brag sheet. It is hard to imagine what edge this could have given Mr. Obama in a friendly chat, if he even saw the N.S.A.\u2019s modest scoop. (The White House won\u2019t say.) \n \n But it was emblematic of an agency that for decades has operated on the principle that any eavesdropping that can be done on a foreign target of any conceivable interest \u2014 now or in the future \u2014 should be done. After all, American intelligence officials reasoned, who\u2019s going to find out? \n \n From thousands of classified documents, the National Security Agency emerges as an electronic omnivore of staggering capabilities, eavesdropping and hacking its way around the world to strip governments and other targets of their secrets, all the while enforcing the utmost secrecy about its own operations. It spies routinely on friends as well as foes, as has become obvious in recent weeks; the agency\u2019s official mission list includes using its surveillance powers to achieve \u201cdiplomatic advantage\u201d over such allies as France and Germany and \u201ceconomic advantage\u201d over Japan and Brazil, among other countries. \n \n Mr. Obama found himself in September standing uncomfortably beside the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who was furious at being named as a target of N.S.A. eavesdropping. Since then, there has been a parade of such protests, from the European Union, Mexico, France, Germany and Spain. Chagrined American officials joke that soon there will be complaints from foreign leaders feeling slighted because the agency had not targeted them. \n \n James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence, has repeatedly dismissed such objections as brazen hypocrisy from countries that do their own share of spying. But in a recent interview, he acknowledged that the scale of eavesdropping by the N.S.A., with 35,000 workers and $10.8 billion a year, sets it apart. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that from a capability standpoint we probably dwarf everybody on the planet, just about, with perhaps the exception of Russia and China,\u201d he said. \n \n Since Edward J. Snowden began releasing the agency\u2019s documents in June, the unrelenting stream of disclosures has opened the most extended debate on the agency\u2019s mission since its creation in 1952. The scrutiny has ignited a crisis of purpose and legitimacy for the N.S.A., the nation\u2019s largest intelligence agency, and the White House has ordered a review of both its domestic and its foreign intelligence collection. While much of the focus has been on whether the agency violates Americans\u2019 privacy, an issue under examination by Congress and two review panels, the anger expressed around the world about American surveillance has prompted far broader questions. \n \n If secrecy can no longer be taken for granted, when does the political risk of eavesdropping overseas outweigh its intelligence benefits? Should foreign citizens, many of whom now rely on American companies for email and Internet services, have any privacy protections from the N.S.A.? Will the American Internet giants\u2019 collaboration with the agency, voluntary or otherwise, damage them in international markets? And are the agency\u2019s clandestine efforts to weaken encryption making the Internet less secure for everyone? \n \n Matthew M. Aid, an intelligence historian and author of a 2009 book on the N.S.A., said there is no precedent for the hostile questions coming at the agency from all directions. \n \n \u201cFrom N.S.A.\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s a disaster,\u201d Mr. Aid said. \u201cEvery new disclosure reinforces the notion that the agency needs to be reined in. There are political consequences, and there will be operational consequences.\u201d \n \n A review of classified agency documents obtained by Mr. Snowden and shared with The New York Times by The Guardian, offers a rich sampling of the agency\u2019s global operations and culture. (At the agency\u2019s request, The Times is withholding some details that officials said could compromise intelligence operations.) The N.S.A. seems to be listening everywhere in the world, gathering every stray electron that might add, however minutely, to the United States government\u2019s knowledge of the world. To some Americans, that may be a comfort. To others, and to people overseas, that may suggest an agency out of control. ||||| Mr. Obama found himself in September standing uncomfortably beside the president of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff, who was furious at being named as a target of N.S.A. eavesdropping.

But the N.S.A., born when the long-distance call was a bit exotic, has seen its potential targets explode in number with the advent of personal computers, the Internet and cellphones. Today\u2019s N.S.A. is the Amazon of intelligence agencies, as different from the 1950s agency as that online behemoth is from a mom-and-pop bookstore. It sucks the contents from fiber-optic cables, sits on telephone switches and Internet hubs, digitally burglarizes laptops and plants bugs on smartphones around the globe. \n \n Mr. Obama and top intelligence officials have defended the agency\u2019s role in preventing terrorist attacks. But as the documents make clear, the focus on counterterrorism is a misleadingly narrow sales pitch for an agency with an almost unlimited agenda. Its scale and aggressiveness are breathtaking. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The agency\u2019s Dishfire database \u2014 nothing happens without a code word at the N.S.A. \u2014 stores years of text messages from around the world, just in case. Its Tracfin collection accumulates gigabytes of credit card purchases. The fellow pretending to send a text message at an Internet cafe in Jordan may be using an N.S.A. technique code-named Polarbreeze to tap into nearby computers. The Russian businessman who is socially active on the web might just become food for Snacks, the acronym-mad agency\u2019s Social Network Analysis Collaboration Knowledge Services, which figures out the personnel hierarchies of organizations from texts. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The spy agency\u2019s station in Texas intercepted 478 emails while helping to foil a jihadist plot to kill a Swedish artist who had drawn pictures of the Prophet Muhammad. N.S.A. analysts delivered to authorities at Kennedy International Airport the names and flight numbers of workers dispatched by a Chinese human smuggling ring. \n \n The agency\u2019s eavesdropping gear, aboard a Defense Department plane flying 60,000 feet over Colombia, fed the location and plans of FARC rebels to the Colombian Army. In the Orlandocard operation, N.S.A. technicians set up what they called a \u201choneypot\u201d computer on the web that attracted visits from 77,413 foreign computers and planted spyware on more than 1,000 that the agency deemed of potential future interest. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The Global Phone Book \n \n No investment seems too great if it adds to the agency\u2019s global phone book. After mounting a major eavesdropping effort focused on a climate change conference in Bali in 2007, agency analysts stationed in Australia\u2019s outback were especially thrilled by one catch: the cellphone number of Bali\u2019s police chief. \n \n \u201cOur mission,\u201d says the agency\u2019s current five-year plan, which has not been officially scheduled for declassification until 2032, \u201cis to answer questions about threatening activities that others mean to keep hidden.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The aspirations are grandiose: to \u201cutterly master\u201d foreign intelligence carried on communications networks. The language is corporate: \u201cOur business processes need to promote data-driven decision-making.\u201d But the tone is also strikingly moralistic for a government bureaucracy. Perhaps to counter any notion that eavesdropping is a shady enterprise, signals intelligence, or Sigint, the term of art for electronic intercepts, is presented as the noblest of callings. \n \n \u201cSigint professionals must hold the moral high ground, even as terrorists or dictators seek to exploit our freedoms,\u201d the plan declares. \u201cSome of our adversaries will say or do anything to advance their cause; we will not.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The N.S.A. documents taken by Mr. Snowden and shared with The Times, numbering in the thousands and mostly dating from 2007 to 2012, are part of a collection of about 50,000 items that focus mainly on its British counterpart, Government Communications Headquarters or G.C.H.Q. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n While far from comprehensive, the documents give a sense of the agency\u2019s reach and abilities, from the Navy ships snapping up radio transmissions as they cruise off the coast of China, to the satellite dishes at Fort Meade in Maryland ingesting worldwide banking transactions, to the rooftops of 80 American embassies and consulates around the world from which the agency\u2019s Special Collection Service aims its antennas. \n \n Photo \n \n The agency and its many defenders among senior government officials who have relied on its top secret reports say it is crucial to American security and status in the world, pointing to terrorist plots disrupted, nuclear proliferation tracked and diplomats kept informed. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But the documents released by Mr. Snowden sometimes also seem to underscore the limits of what even the most intensive intelligence collection can achieve by itself. Blanket N.S.A. eavesdropping in Afghanistan, described in the documents as covering government offices and the hide-outs of second-tier Taliban militants alike, has failed to produce a clear victory against a low-tech enemy. The agency kept track as Syria amassed its arsenal of chemical weapons \u2014 but that knowledge did nothing to prevent the gruesome slaughter outside Damascus in August. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The documents are skewed toward celebration of the agency\u2019s self-described successes, as underlings brag in PowerPoints to their bosses about their triumphs and the managers lay out grand plans. But they do not entirely omit the agency\u2019s flubs and foibles: flood tides of intelligence gathered at huge cost that goes unexamined; intercepts that cannot be read for lack of language skills; and computers that \u2014 even at the N.S.A. \u2014 go haywire in all the usual ways. \n \n Mapping Message Trails \n \n In May 2009, analysts at the agency learned that Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was to make a rare trip to Kurdistan Province in the country\u2019s mountainous northwest. The agency immediately organized a high-tech espionage mission, part of a continuing project focused on Ayatollah Khamenei called Operation Dreadnought. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Working closely with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, which handles satellite photography, as well as G.C.H.Q., the N.S.A. team studied the Iranian leader\u2019s entourage, its vehicles and its weaponry from satellites, and intercepted air traffic messages as planes and helicopters took off and landed. \n \n They heard Ayatollah Khamenei\u2019s aides fretting about finding a crane to load an ambulance and fire truck onto trucks for the journey. They listened as he addressed a crowd, segregated by gender, in a soccer field. \n \n They studied Iranian air defense radar stations and recorded the travelers\u2019 rich communications trail, including Iranian satellite coordinates collected by an N.S.A. program called Ghosthunter. The point was not so much to catch the Iranian leader\u2019s words, but to gather the data for blanket eavesdropping on Iran in the event of a crisis. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n This \u201ccommunications fingerprinting,\u201d as a document called it, is the key to what the N.S.A. does. It allows the agency\u2019s computers to scan the stream of international communications and pluck out messages tied to the supreme leader. In a crisis \u2014 say, a showdown over Iran\u2019s nuclear program \u2014 the ability to tap into the communications of leaders, generals and scientists might give a crucial advantage. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n On a more modest scale, the same kind of effort, what N.S.A. calls \u201cSigint development,\u201d was captured in a document the agency obtained in 2009 from Somalia \u2014 whether from a human source or an electronic break-in was not noted. It contained email addresses and other contact details for 117 selected customers of a Mogadishu Internet service, Globalsom. \n \n While most on the list were Somali officials or citizens, presumably including some suspected of militancy, the document also included emails for a United Nations political officer in Mogadishu and a local representative for the charity World Vision, among other international institutions. All, it appeared, were considered fair game for monitoring. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n This huge investment in collection is driven by pressure from the agency\u2019s \u201ccustomers,\u201d in government jargon, not only at the White House, Pentagon, F.B.I. and C.I.A., but also spread across the Departments of State and Energy, Homeland Security and Commerce, and the United States Trade Representative. \n \n Photo \n \n By many accounts, the agency provides more than half of the intelligence nuggets delivered to the White House early each morning in the President\u2019s Daily Brief \u2014 a measure of success for American spies. (One document boasts that listening in on Nigerian State Security had provided items for the briefing \u201cnearly two dozen\u201d times.) In every international crisis, American policy makers look to the N.S.A. for inside information. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Pressure to Get Everything \n \n That creates intense pressure not to miss anything. When that is combined with an ample budget and near-invisibility to the public, the result is aggressive surveillance of the kind that has sometimes gotten the agency in trouble with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a United States federal court that polices its programs for breaches of Americans\u2019 privacy. \n \n In the funding boom that followed the Sept. 11 attacks, the agency expanded and decentralized far beyond its Fort Meade headquarters in Maryland, building or expanding major facilities in Georgia, Texas, Colorado, Hawaii, Alaska, Washington State and Utah. Its officers also operate out of major overseas stations in England, Australia, South Korea and Japan, at overseas military bases, and from locked rooms housing the Special Collection Service inside American missions abroad. \n \n The agency, using a combination of jawboning, stealth and legal force, has turned the nation\u2019s Internet and telecommunications companies into collection partners, installing filters in their facilities, serving them with court orders, building back doors into their software and acquiring keys to break their encryption. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But even that vast American-run web is only part of the story. For decades, the N.S.A. has shared eavesdropping duties with the rest of the so-called Five Eyes, the Sigint agencies of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. More limited cooperation occurs with many more countries, including formal arrangements called Nine Eyes and 14 Eyes and Nacsi, an alliance of the agencies of 26 NATO countries. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The extent of Sigint sharing can be surprising: \u201cN.S.A. may pursue a relationship with Vietnam,\u201d one 2009 G.C.H.Q. document reported. But a recent G.C.H.Q. training document suggests that not everything is shared, even between the United States and Britain. \u201cEconomic well-being reporting,\u201d it says, referring to intelligence gathered to aid the British economy, \u201ccannot be shared with any foreign partner.\u201d \n \n As at the school lunch table, decisions on who gets left out can cause hurt feelings: \u201cGermans were a little grumpy at not being invited to join the 9-Eyes group,\u201d one 2009 document remarks. And in a delicate spy-versus-spy dance, sharing takes place even with governments that are themselves important N.S.A. targets, notably Israel. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The documents describe collaboration with the Israel Sigint National Unit, which gets raw N.S.A. eavesdropping material and provides it in return, but they also mention the agency\u2019s tracking of \u201chigh priority Israeli military targets,\u201d including drone aircraft and the Black Sparrow missile system. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

At one highly valued overseas listening post, the very presence of American N.S.A. personnel violates a treaty agreed to by the agency\u2019s foreign host. Even though much of the eavesdropping is run remotely from N.S.A.\u2019s base at Fort Gordon, Ga., Americans who visit the site must pose as contractors, carry fake business cards and are warned: \u201cDon\u2019t dress as typical Americans.\" \n \n \u201cKnow your cover legend,\u201d a PowerPoint security briefing admonishes the N.S.A. staff members headed to the overseas station, directing them to \u201csanitize personal effects,\u201d send no postcards home and buy no identifiably local souvenirs. (\u201cAn option might be jewelry. Most jewelry does not have any markings\u201d showing its place of origin.) \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Bypassing Security \n \n In the agency\u2019s early years, its brainy staff members \u2014 it remains the largest employer of mathematicians in the country \u2014 played an important role in the development of the first computers, then largely a tool for code breaking. \n \n Photo \n \n Today, with personal computers, laptops, tablets and smartphones in most homes and government offices in the developed world, hacking has become the agency\u2019s growth area. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Some of Mr. Snowden\u2019s documents describe the exploits of Tailored Access Operations, the prim name for the N.S.A. division that breaks into computers around the world to steal the data inside, and sometimes to leave spy software behind. T.A.O. is increasingly important in part because it allows the agency to bypass encryption by capturing messages as they are written or read, when they are not encoded. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In Baghdad, T.A.O. collected messages left in draft form in email accounts maintained by leaders of the Islamic State of Iraq, a militant group. Under a program called Spinaltap, the division\u2019s hackers identified 24 unique Internet Protocol addresses identifying computers used by the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, making it possible to snatch Hezbollah messages from the flood of global communications sifted by the agency. \n \n The N.S.A.\u2019s elite Transgression Branch, created in 2009 to \u201cdiscover, understand, evaluate and exploit\u201d foreign hackers\u2019 work, quietly piggybacks on others\u2019 incursions into computers of interest, like thieves who follow other housebreakers around and go through the windows they have left ajar. \n \n In one 2010 hacking operation code-named Ironavenger, for instance, the N.S.A. spied simultaneously on an ally and an adversary. Analysts spotted suspicious emails being sent to a government office of great intelligence interest in a hostile country and realized that an American ally was \u201cspear-phishing\u201d \u2014 sending official-looking emails that, when opened, planted malware that let hackers inside. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The Americans silently followed the foreign hackers, collecting documents and passwords from computers in the hostile country, an elusive target. They got a look inside that government and simultaneously got a close-up look at the ally\u2019s cyberskills, the kind of intelligence twofer that is the unit\u2019s specialty. \n \n In many other ways, advances in computer and communications technology have been a boon for the agency. N.S.A. analysts tracked the electronic trail left by a top leader of Al Qaeda in Africa each time he stopped to use a computer on his travels. They correctly predicted his next stop, and the police were there to arrest him. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n And at the big N.S.A. station at Fort Gordon, technicians developed an automated service called \u201cWhere\u2019s My Node?\u201d that sent an email to an analyst every time a target overseas moved from one cell tower to another. Without lifting a finger, an analyst could follow his quarry\u2019s every move. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The Limits of Spying \n \n The techniques described in the Snowden documents can make the N.S.A. seem omniscient, and nowhere in the world is that impression stronger than in Afghanistan. But the agency\u2019s capabilities at the tactical level have not been nearly enough to produce clear-cut strategic success there, in the United States\u2019 longest war. \n \n A single daily report from June 2011 from the N.S.A.\u2019s station in Kandahar, Afghanistan, the heart of Taliban country, illustrates the intensity of eavesdropping coverage, requiring 15 pages to describe a day\u2019s work. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The agency listened while insurgents from the Haqqani network mounted an attack on the Hotel Intercontinental in Kabul, overhearing the attackers talking to their bosses in Pakistan\u2019s tribal area and recording events minute by minute. \u201cRuhullah claimed he was on the third floor and had already inflicted one casualty,\u201d the report said in a typical entry. \u201cHe also indicated that Hafiz was located on a different floor.\u201d \n \n Photo \n \n N.S.A. officers listened as two Afghan Foreign Ministry officials prepared for a meeting between President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and Iranian officials, assuring them that relations with the United States \u201cwould in no way threaten the interests of Iran,\u201d which they decided Mr. Karzai should describe as a \u201cbrotherly country.\u201d \n \n The N.S.A. eavesdropped as the top United Nations official in Afghanistan, Staffan de Mistura, consulted his European Union counterpart, Vygaudas Usackas, about how to respond to an Afghan court\u2019s decision to overturn the election of 62 members of Parliament. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n And the agency was a fly on the wall for a long-running land dispute between the mayor of Kandahar and a prominent local man known as the Keeper of the Cloak of the Prophet Muhammad, with President Karzai\u2019s late brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, as a mediator. \n \n The agency discovered a Taliban claim to have killed five police officers at a checkpoint by giving them poisoned yogurt, and heard a provincial governor tell an aide that a district police chief was verbally abusing women and clergymen. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n A Taliban figure, Mullah Rahimullah Akhund, known on the United States military\u2019s kill-or-capture list by the code name Objective Squiz Incinerator, was overheard instructing an associate to buy suicide vests and a Japanese motorbike, according to the documents. \n \n And N.S.A. listened in as a Saudi extremist, Abu Mughira, called his mother to report that he and his fellow fighters had entered Afghanistan and \u201cdone victorious operations.\u201d \n \n Such reports flowed from the agency\u2019s Kandahar station day after day, year after year, and surely strengthened the American campaign against the Taliban. But they also suggest the limits of intelligence against a complex political and military challenge. The N.S.A. recorded the hotel attack, but it had not prevented it. It tracked Mr. Karzai\u2019s government, but he remained a difficult and volatile partner. Its surveillance was crucial in the capture or killing of many enemy fighters, but not nearly enough to remove the Taliban\u2019s ominous shadow from Afghanistan\u2019s future. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Mining All the Tidbits \n \n In the Afghan reports and many others, a striking paradox is the odd intimacy of a sprawling, technology-driven agency with its targets. It is the one-way intimacy of the eavesdropper, as N.S.A. employees virtually enter the office cubicles of obscure government officials and the Spartan hide-outs of drug traffickers and militants around the world. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Venezuela, for instance, was one of six \u201cenduring targets\u201d in N.S.A.\u2019s official mission list from 2007, along with China, North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Russia. The United States viewed itself in a contest for influence in Latin America with Venezuela\u2019s leader then, the leftist firebrand Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who allied himself with Cuba, and one agency goal was \u201cpreventing Venezuela from achieving its regional leadership objectives and pursuing policies that negatively impact U.S. global interests.\u201d \n \n A glimpse of what this meant in practice comes in a brief PowerPoint presentation from August 2010 on \u201cDevelopment of the Venezuelan Economic Mission.\u201d The N.S.A. was tracking billions of dollars flowing to Caracas in loans from China (radar systems and oil drilling), Russia (MIG fighter planes and shoulder-fired missiles) and Iran (a factory to manufacture drone aircraft). \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But it was also getting up-close and personal with Venezuela\u2019s Ministry of Planning and Finance, monitoring the government and personal emails of the top 10 Venezuelan economic officials. An N.S.A. officer in Texas, in other words, was paid each day to peruse the private messages of obscure Venezuelan bureaucrats, hunting for tidbits that might offer some tiny policy edge. \n \n Photo \n \n In a counterdrug operation in late 2011, the agency\u2019s officers seemed to know more about relations within a sprawling narcotics network than the drug dealers themselves. They listened to \u201cRicketts,\u201d a Jamaican drug supplier based in Ecuador, struggling to keep his cocaine and marijuana smuggling business going after an associate, \u201cGordo,\u201d claimed he had paid $250,000 and received nothing in return. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The N.S.A., a report said, was on top of not just their cellphones, but also those of the whole network of \u201cbuyers, transporters, suppliers, and middlemen\u201d stretching from the Netherlands and Nova Scotia to Panama City and Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The documents do not say whether arrests resulted from all that eavesdropping. \n \n Even with terrorists, N.S.A. units can form a strangely personal relationship. The N.S.A.-G.C.H.Q. wiki, a top secret group blog that Mr. Snowden downloaded, lists 14 specialists scattered in various stations assigned to Lashkar-e-Taiba, the Pakistani terrorist group that carried out the bloody attack on Mumbai in 2008, with titles including \u201cPakistan Access Pursuit Team\u201d and \u201cTechniques Discovery Branch.\u201d Under the code name Treaclebeta, N.S.A.\u2019s hackers at Tailored Access Operations also played a role. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In the wiki\u2019s casual atmosphere, American and British eavesdroppers exchange the peculiar shoptalk of the secret world. \u201cI don\u2019t normally use Heretic to scan the fax traffic, I use Nucleon,\u201d one user writes, describing technical tools for searching intercepted documents. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n But most striking are the one-on-one pairings of spies and militants; Bryan is assigned to listen in on a man named Haroon, and Paul keeps an ear on Fazl. \n \n A Flood of Details \n \n One N.S.A. officer on the Lashkar-e-Taiba beat let slip that some of his eavesdropping turned out to be largely pointless, perhaps because of the agency\u2019s chronic shortage of skilled linguists. He \u201cran some queries\u201d to read intercepted communications of certain Lashkar-e-Taiba members, he wrote in the wiki, but added: \u201cMost of it is in Arabic or Farsi, so I can\u2019t make much of it.\u201d \n \n It is a glimpse of the unsurprising fact that sometimes the agency\u2019s expensive and expansive efforts accomplish little. Despite the agency\u2019s embrace of corporate jargon on goal-setting and evaluation, it operates without public oversight in an arena in which achievements are hard to measure. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In a world of ballooning communications, the agency is sometimes simply overwhelmed. In 2008, the N.S.A.\u2019s Middle East and North Africa group set about updating its Sigint collection capabilities. The \u201cambitious scrub\u201d of selectors \u2014 essentially search terms \u2014 cut the number of terms automatically searched from 21,177 to 7,795 and the number of messages added to the agency\u2019s Pinwale database from 850,000 a day to 450,000 a day. \n \n The reduction in volume was treated as a major achievement, opening the way for new collection on Iranian leadership and Saudi and Syrian diplomats, the report said. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n And in a note that may comfort computer novices, the N.S.A. Middle East analysts discovered major glitches in their search software: The computer was searching for the names of targets but not their email addresses, a rather fundamental flaw. \u201cOver 500 messages in one week did not come in,\u201d the report said about one target. \n \n Those are daily course corrections. Whether the Snowden disclosures will result in deeper change is uncertain. Joel F. Brenner, the agency\u2019s former inspector general, says much of the criticism is unfair, reflecting a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about the realpolitik of spying. \u201cThe agency is being browbeaten for doing too well the things it\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d he said. \n \n But Mr. Brenner added that he believes \u201ctechnology has outrun policy\u201d at the N.S.A., and that in an era in which spying may well be exposed, \u201croutine targeting of close allies is bad politics and is foolish.\u201d \n \n Another former insider worries less about foreign leaders\u2019 sensitivities than the potential danger the sprawling agency poses at home. William E. Binney, a former senior N.S.A. official who has become an outspoken critic, says he has no problem with spying on foreign targets like Brazil\u2019s president or the German chancellor, Angela Merkel. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty much what every government does,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the foundation of diplomacy.\u201d But Mr. Binney said that without new leadership, new laws and top-to-bottom reform, the agency will represent a threat of \u201cturnkey totalitarianism\u201d \u2014 the capability to turn its awesome power, now directed mainly against other countries, on the American public. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cI think it\u2019s already starting to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s what we have to stop.\u201d \n \n Whatever reforms may come, Bobby R. Inman, who weathered his own turbulent period as N.S.A. director from 1977 to 1981, offers his hyper-secret former agency a radical suggestion for right now. \u201cMy advice would be to take everything you think Snowden has and get it out yourself,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would certainly be a shock to the agency.

Donald Blakeslee says he\u2019s found it. \n \n The discovery could put south-central Kansas on the map as the second-biggest settlement of Native Americans found in the United States, Blakeslee said. And it\u2019s now, finally, the known location of a 1601 battle pitting outnumbered Spaniards firing cannon into waves of attacking Indian warriors. \n \n Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP! \n \n Etzanoa has remained a mystery for 400 years. Archaeologists could not find it. Historians thought reports of a permanent settlement with 20,000 Native Americans in it were exaggerated. \n \n But here in Arkansas City, at the confluence of the Walnut and Arkansas Rivers, Blakeslee, an anthropologist and archaeologist at Wichita State University, has found evidence of a massive town stretching across thousands of acres of bluffs and rich bottomland along two rivers. What clinched it was the discovery, by a high school kid, of a half-inch iron cannon ball. \n \n He even found a still-functional water shrine, depicting communication with the spirit world, carved into a limestone boulder in Tami and Greg Norwood\u2019s backyard. \n \n It\u2019s a good story, all true, Blakeslee said: A lost city, a forgotten mythology \u2014 and the story of the once-great Wichita Nation, decimated by European diseases, then pushed aside by American settlers and the United States Army. \n \n Amazed by the size \n \n With the discovery, Arkansas City leaders are hoping to turn their town into a tourist destination. \n \n \u201cWe always knew we once had a whole bunch of Indians living around here, because we had found way too many artifacts to think otherwise,\u201d said Jay Warren, an Arkansas City council member. \u201cBut we had no idea until Dr. Blakeslee came along about how big it was.\u201d \n \n Etzanoa might have been comparable in size to Cahokia, Blakeslee said. That alone should bring world attention. \n \n The Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in western Illinois, with its pyramid Monk\u2019s Mound, is the biggest Native American urban complex ever built in the United States. It showcases the 14.4-acre mound that was the centerpiece of the ancient city, along with the outlines of the city, enclosed by fortress walls and filled with shrines of a powerful mythology and culture outside St. Louis. \n \n Cahokia \u2014 the remnants of the largest pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico \u2014 attracts 400,000 visitors a year, a fact that gets the attention of Arkansas Citians. If Etzanoa was bigger, \u201cand it might have been,\u201d that will rewrite American history, Blakeslee said. \n \n \u201cThe Spaniards were amazed by the size of Etzanoa,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cThey counted 2,000 houses that could hold 10 people each. They said it would take two or three days to walk through it all.\u201d \n \n But for four centuries, the story of a big Native American town in Kansas made no sense to historians. \n \n When French explorers came in the 1700s, 100 years after the Spanish battle, they met only migratory bands of Kanza, Wichita, Pawnee, Kiowa, Cheyenne and Apache tribes. \n \n So historians read the Spanish accounts and raised questions: If there were a permanent mega-site named Etzanoa, where was the huge accumulation of pottery shards? \n \n And where did those tens of thousands of people go? Twenty thousand, as the Spaniards estimated in 1601, is equivalent to modern-day Derby, Liberal or Hays. \n \n And how could Plains hunters feed tens of thousands day after day? Bison are dangerous. The Wichita had no horses and hunted on foot. \n \n And where were the Spanish cannonballs, fired by outnumbered and terrified Spaniards? \n \n The battle \n \n For years, Blakeslee, 73, had read the accounts of soldiers who served under the Conquistador Juan de Onate, the founding governor of the colony of New Mexico. Onate\u2019s soldiers said they fought a battle 60 years after Coronado, somewhere in the Great Plains. \n \n The battle reports said Onate led 70 soldiers from New Mexico and found a vast town at the junction of two rivers. \n \n Warriors on the outskirts threw dirt into the air as the Spanish approached, signaling they were ready to fight. \u201cThe Rayados,\u201d Onate called the Wichitas \u2014 \u201cThe striped ones,\u201d from the way they painted and tattooed their faces. \n \n The Spaniards entered the town, and the Wichita fled, thousands evacuating to the north. \n \n Onate sent armed patrols into the empty town. \n \n What his soldiers saw unnerved them. They told Onate they\u2019d counted 2,000 big beehive-shaped homes \u2014 clusters of these homes surrounded by cornfields. Nervous about the size of the place, they turned around. Indians told them later that the settlement extended for miles past where the Spaniards stopped, meaning the true population might have been higher than the 20,000 Spanish estimate. \n \n Onate turned his men south \u2014 and came face to face with hundreds of warriors, firing arrows and charging at Onate\u2019s small Spanish troop. \n \n The attackers were Escanxaques, a tribe enemy to the Wichita. They had come to attack Etzanoa \u2014 and now attacked the Spanish. \n \n Sixty of the 70 Spaniards were wounded. Their four cannons saved them, clusters of iron bullets fired from cannon-like shotgun blasts, whistling into trees and boulders. The Escanxaques, stunned, regrouped in a rock-lined ravine, but then charged repeatedly uphill to attack before finally backing off. \n \n Cannonballs confirm \n \n It was a high school kid, Adam Ziegler, who made the link that cinched the verification of Etzanoa. \n \n Blakeslee says artifacts he and Ziegler found in the past two years show the old stories were true, and that between the years 1450 and 1700, at least 20,000 ancestors of today\u2019s Wichita Nation thrived in and near what is now Arkansas City. \n \n Blakeslee realized the confluence of the Walnut and Arkansas rivers could be the one described by the Spanish. He found traces of houses and granaries. He\u2019s walked over much of Arkansas City and saw that the ravines and bluffs fit the Spanish accounts. \n \n After locals like Hap McCleod told him people had been digging up \u201cliterally tons\u201d of flint tools and clay pottery shards for generations, Blakeslee dug up his own shards, flint arrowheads, knife blades, hide-scrapers and awls. \n \n Two years ago he found a rock-lined ravine in McLeod\u2019s backyard that matched the Spanish account of where the Escanxaques regrouped under fire to attack. He took a metal detector there, along with Ziegler, a Lawrence Free-State High School freshman. \n \n \u201cThey couldn\u2019t find anything that day,\u201d Ziegler recalled. \u201cDr. Blakeslee said I could use his metal detector. An hour or two later, I found the little ball, buried four inches deep.\u201d \n \n Blakeslee found two more Spanish cannonballs. \n \n That did it, Blakeslee said. The old story was true. \n \n Tough beyond belief \n \n Blakeslee says the Wichita were wronged by fate, disease epidemics and war. He\u2019s going to try to set right what he can. \n \n Smallpox and other illnesses killed probably tens of thousands after 1600, he said. \n \n War and relocation forced survivors to Oklahoma reservations. The tribe lost most of its culture. The tribe\u2019s last fluent speaker of the Wichita language, Doris McLemore, died last year. \n \n The Wichita were organized, cultured \u2014 \u201cand tough almost beyond belief,\u201d he said. \n \n They and their Wichita cousins in Quivira, in Rice County, built a trade network with ancestors of the Pueblo Indians in New Mexico. They strapped 50-pound packages of dried meat and hides to themselves and their pack dogs, and walked 550 miles to the Pueblos. They\u2019d then walk back, bringing home cotton fabric, obsidian and turquoise. \n \n They had no horses. The women and children likely helped hunt bison, Blakeslee said, forming lines and waving hide blankets while driving bison toward warriors carrying bows and arrows. \u201cThink of the courage that took,\u201d Blakeslee said. \n \n They cultivated beans, maize (corn), pumpkin and squash. They slaughtered bison meat and hides on an industrial scale. The men likely scouted, walking miles a day, shadowing herds. The women used flint hide-scrapers to thin down bison hides. \u201cFrom doing that all day, they probably had the toughest fists,\u201d Blakeslee said. \u201cYou\u2019d never want to get in a fistfight with a Wichita woman.\u201d \n \n Intrigue, concern \n \n Modern-day Wichitas number about 3,000, based now in Anadarko, Okla., said Gary McAdams, who has held several leadership positions with the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes. \n \n The Wichita are intrigued \u2014 and concerned \u2014 by what might come next, McAdams said. Blakeslee has consulted with them for years, telling what he\u2019s found, inviting them to visit sites at Arkansas City and at the 160-foot-long serpent symbol still visible in the pasture grass in Rice County. Wichitas have helped on some of his digs. \n \n \u201cWe would have some concern about how they go about developing their thinking about Etzanoa as a tourist center,\u201d McAdams said. \u201cWe are supportive of any respectful endeavor they want to pursue there \u2014 but would want to provide our input.\u201d \n \n Jay Warren, a city council member, says the town will explore development. \n \n Cahokia, in Illinois, attracts 400,000 visitors a year, but mostly because of how striking the 100-foot-tall Monk\u2019s Mound looks, and because it\u2019s located next to St. Louis and Interstate 70. \n \n Arkansas City, in contrast, has pastureland. \n \n But Civil War battlefields don\u2019t have a Monk\u2019s Mound either, Warren said. \u201cAnd yet they attract thousands of visitors by doing a great job with walking trails and signs that explain step-by-step what was going on.\u201d \n \n If Arkansas City with its 12,000 people could attract 20,000 students, archaeologists and tourists a year, it would give the city a boost, said McLeod, in whose backyard Adam Ziegler found that cannonball. McLeod now runs the Etzanoa Conservancy, and has worked for two years to polish ideas. \u201cWe\u2019re really proud that all this history happened here, and we want to share it with the world,\u201d he said. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about putting together a one-day wonder,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at creating something that could be great for the region, and for 50 years and more down the road. We\u2019re talking with (Unified School District) 470 about how it could enhance education. And we think the site could also be a hands-on field training facility for archaeologists from all over the world.\u201d \n \n They could build an interactive visitor center, he said. They could build reconstructions of the grass houses and granaries the Wichita used. They could employ flint-knappers who could show how skilled craftsmen made arrowheads and knife blades. \n \n Etzanoa would have been beautiful, McLeod said. The river bluffs south of Arkansas City look like picture postcards. The bluffs and hills pour out clear spring water from dells and nooks. \n \n McLeod drove up recently to the tallest point in Arkansas City \u2014 where the city\u2019s golf course clubhouse sits. \n \n Blakeslee had told him that\u2019s where Caratax, the Wichita chief in 1601, probably kept his home. \n \n \u201cYou can see 360 degrees in any direction from here,\u201d McLeod said. \n \n \u201cAnd it\u2019s all beautiful.\u201d ||||| Volunteer Adam Ziegler found an iron ball while volunteering to help archaeologists uncover remnants of a Native American settlement east of Arkansas City, Kan., in June. The ball was fired by a Spanish cannon at ancestors of the Wichita tribe, who ambushed an expedition led by Don Juan de Onate in 1601, according to Don Blakeslee, an archaeologist who led a study of the site. FOSS FARRAR Arkansas City Traveler ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Donald Blakeslee, professor of archaeology at Wichita State University, presented in March at the annual conference of the Society for American Archaeology discussing recent archaeological evidence that shows a thriving ancestral Wichita Indian town of more than 20,000 residents near Arkansas City, Kansas. \n \n The discovery began with new translations of old Spanish documents by the Cibola Project at the University of California, Berkley. Members of the team made photocopies of the original documents, re-transcribed them from the Old Spanish and then retranslated them. Earlier historians and archaeologists who had used the documents dealt with misleading errors in transcription and translation, which is why many archaeological discoveries in the area were misinterpreted. \n \n \u201cIt has been a lot of fun to rewrite the record so thoroughly. By joining the historical written record to the archaeology, we ended up rewriting both fields,\u201d says Blakeslee. \u201cRather than a cluster of 30 little villages, there was a single town of 20,000 people.\u201d \n \n Research of the town, called Etzanoa, has completely revised the understanding of protohistoric settlements in the southern plains. Previous scholars often dismissed the Spanish population estimates as exaggerations, but with the evidence of the archaeological finds it can no longer be dismissed. \n \n \u201cOne implication is that Old World epidemic diseases had not yet reached this region, but probably did so by around 1650, because there were far fewer Wichitas when the French arrived in 1718,\u201d says Blakeslee. \n \n Blakeslee reported archaeology that coincides with eyewitness accounts from five soldiers of Spanish explorer and founder of New Mexico, Juan de O\u00f1ate, who were interviewed in Mexico City in 1602. \n \n Scattered surface finds match the description of the town as extending about five miles, and the description of the landscape and route of the Spanish army also line up. The biggest piece of confirmation came with the discovery of the site of a battle fought there in 1601. Metal detectors were used to uncover small iron shot from in front of the ravine where natives took shelter and well beyond it where shots eventually fell. \n \n Blakeslee began work at the site in 2015 when he invited leaders of the Wichita tribe to visit and spent a week there researching. He\u2019s been able to involve WSU students with the research as well and has taken them to the site each summer since. They plan to be there for four weeks during summer 2017. \n \n \u201cWork at Etzanoa will continue for the rest of my career and beyond,\u201d says Blakeslee. \u201cIt will be an important part of WSU\u2019s future.\u201d",
    "reference": "\u2013 Don Juan de O\u00f1ate sought a city of gold when he explored what are now the Plains states. It wasn't to be, but according to an interview given by five of his men in 1602, they did find something staggering: a \"great settlement\" some five miles long that housed at least 20,000 people, an ancestral Wichita Indian town called Etzanoa. But French explorers in the region 100 years later found no sign of those people, sowing confusion among latter-day historians. Donald Blakeslee, an archaeologist with Wichita State University, says he's cleared it all up: Etzanoa did exist, he claims, once thriving where the Walnut and Arkansas Rivers meet in Arkansas City, Kansas. Per a university press release, things got off the ground with a new and more correct transcription of centuries-old Spanish documents by the University of California, Berkeley's Cibola Project. Prior translation errors caused \"many archaeological discoveries in the area [to be] misinterpreted,\" per the release. In 2015, Blakeslee noted that a geographic description of a 1601 ambush described in a Spanish account had to have occurred where the rivers joined. And, indeed, a search there turned up small iron cannon balls, reported the Kansas City Star at the time. If Blakeslee is right, the \"long-lost city\" would be second only to Cahokia on the list of biggest prehistoric Native American sites, reports the Wichita Eagle. That would be a boon for Arkansas City and its 12,000 residents; some 400,000 flock to the remains of Cahokia, in Illinois, each year. The Kansas House of Representatives thinks Blakeslee is onto something; earlier this month it approved a resolution that formally recognizes Etzanoa based on \"the evidence,\" reports the Courier Traveler. (This man followed a hunch, says he uncovered a lost city.)"

    "input": "Augmented reality startup Magic Leap is being sued for sexual discrimination by an executive who was hired to help it appeal to women. \n \n The company, a startup best known for securing a valuation in the billions despite never publicly demonstrating its technology, is being sued by Tannen Campbell, its former head of, and later vice-president of, strategic marketing and brand identity. \n \n Campbell alleges that, in her first few months at Magic Leap, she was asked to put together a presentation to highlight the lack of gender diversity in the company. In her case, filed in the southern district court of Florida, she alleges it took seven months to get chief executive, Rony Abovitz, to attend the presentation, and when he did he left halfway through. Campbell never managed to present the second half. \n \n A year later, another Magic Leap employee, Rachna Bhasin, was asked to head up what the filing describes as \u201ca \u2018female brain trust initiative\u2019 \u2013 the \u2018FBI\u2019\u201d. Bhasin, Campbell and five other women from the company were involved in the initial meeting, in May 2016, alongside Abovitz, the vice-president of product design, Gary Natsume, and \u201ca couple of male members of his team\u201d. \n \n Campbell describes a \u201cchaotic discussion\u201d, in which a number of recommendations were made about a prototype design of Magic Leap\u2019s hardware, \u201csuch as not having the headset connect in the back of the head because such a connection is difficult for people with ponytails or long hair\u201d. None of the proposed changes were made to the design, and later meetings, which were not attended by any of the male members of the team, resulted in \u201cno clear path forward\u201d. \n \n As well as presenting an image of a company where Campbell\u2019s efforts to create a female-friendly workplace and product were coolly received, the suit also alleges more direct tolerance of sexist comments and attitudes. The suit alleges: \n \n An image of two doctors, a man and a woman, prompted the comment \u201clook, it\u2019s Bring Your Wife to Work Day\u201d. \n \n One of the three or four core apps that will ship with Magic Leap\u2019s headset \u201cis a game, \u2018Dr. G.,\u2019 that has no female heroes or lead characters\u201d.

Campbell was told the person in question would not be giving new hire orientations in the future as a result, but that did not happen. \n \n \n \n Campbell alleges that events like those construe a hostile working environment, and is asking for punitive damages from Magic Leap. The company has not responded to a request for comment. \n \n \n \n The lawsuit is the latest piece of bad news for Magic Leap, after a string of stories that began with a report in December 2016 that the company was struggling to incorporate the \u201cdazzling\u201d technology it had used to wow investors into the product it was planning to release. \n \n Alternative Dave (@redletterdave) SCOOP!!! This is the FIRST PUBLIC PHOTO of MAGIC LEAP https://t.co/6hPEMe6eCg pic.twitter.com/oWKBJvKmza \n \n In February, it had to combat mockery after the first picture of its hardware leaked, showing a clunky prototype worn on a backpack. Abovitz responded by arguing that the picture showed \u201can R&D test rig where we collect room/space data for our machine vision/machine learning work\u201d. ||||| Magic Leap CEO Rony Abovitz Getty A newly filed lawsuit by a former Magic Leap VP alleges that the company is a hostile working place for women, a condition that has led to the company missing internal deadlines, according to the complaint. \n \n Tannen Campbell, whose lawsuit in Southern Florida District Court says she was a VP of marketing and brand identity, says in the complaint that she was hired by Rony Abovitz, the CEO by the Dania Beach, Florida-based company to \"help with the pink/blue\" problem, referring to the lack of women in leadership positions at the company. \n \n She also claims that Magic Leap had a culture that assumed its employees were men, including what she says was an internal email describing a policy for \"bored wives at home while you are loving it at the Leap.\" \n \n \"All the engineers and others in predominately-male Magic Leap could conceive of to make the product female friendly was to produce a version in pink,\" the lawsuit alleges. \n \n According to Campbell's complaint, many of the executives at Magic Leap blocked her efforts to reform company policy before she was fired in late December. \n \n Magic Leap has raised $1.39 billion dollars in venture capital, valuing the company at $4.5 billion, from investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, Google, JPMorgan, Fidelity and Alibaba. The company promises to integrate computer graphics into the real world in a stunning way \u2014 a whale jumping out of a gym floor, for example. \n \n But as Business Insider has previously reported, questions remain whether the company can shrink its technology into a mobile, portable form factor. A prototype described to Business Insider by a source as \"the real wearable\" and by CEO Abovitz as \"R&D; test rig where we collect room/space data\" shows a bulky backpack containing the device's computer power, although sources and the lawsuit describe the company's prototype as a \"belt pack.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n Former employees also describe a company with sprawling operations. The lawsuit alleges that the startup has over 1000 employees. \n \n Magic Leap did not immediately return requests for comment. \n \n Missed deadlines \n \n Campbell, who is suing for Magic Leap for sex discrimination, retaliation and hostile work environment, connects the lack of women in Magic Leap's leadership and engineering department with claims of missed internal deadlines. \n \n From the complaint: \n \n \"The macho bullying atmosphere at Magic Leap fosters a dysfunctional culture which creates chaos and lack of process and structure, hinders the company from achieving key product deadlines (including launch, which has shifted back at least 4 times in Campbell's 1.5 years at the company) and, literally, prevented Campbell from doing the job she was hired to do or achieving the goals she and Abovitz had discussed during her initial interview: helping with the \"pink/blue problem\" or making Magic Leap less of a \"boys club.\"\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"Sadly, because Magic Leap seldom hires and does not actively recruit female candidates, the company loses competitive advantage to products like Microsoft's Hololens. Microsoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster time line with more content that appeals to both genders.\" \n \n One of the things Campbell connects to her eventual firing was that she challenged Magic Leap CEO Abovitz, comparing herself to the child in the \"Emperor's New Clothes\" who pointed out that the emperor was naked and not in fact wearing extremely cool invisible clothes. \n \n From the complaint: \n \n Campbell also raised concerns that what Magic Leap showed the public in marketing material was not what the product actually could do\u2014admonitions ignored in favor of her male colleagues' assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap's website and on YouTube were \"aspirational,\" and not Magic Leap's version of \"alternate facts.\" \n \n Here's the full complaint: \n \n Know anything about Magic Leap? Email the author at kleswing@businessinsider.com. ||||| Magic Leap, the mysterious augmented reality startup, continues its slow implosion. \n \n On Monday, a new lawsuit alleged that the Plantation, Fla.-based company promoted a sexist work environment and used misleading marketing materials that inaccurately depicted the product's capabilities. \n \n Tannen Campbell, Magic Leap's former vice president of strategic marketing and brand identity, filed the suit in a federal court in the Southern District of Florida. \n \n The lawsuit alleged Campbell was fired because the company's CEO, Rony Abovitz, refused to acknowledge the misogyny within the company and address a hostile work environment. The company is accused of violating the Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits employers from discriminating against employees on the basis of sex, race, color, national origin and religion. Ultimately, these workplace problems, the lawsuit reads, \"renders it so dysfunctional it continues to delay the launch of a product that attracted billions of investment dollars.\" \n \n Founded in 2010, the company is developing an augmented reality headset that superimposes virtual objects onto the real world, and has amassed $1.4 billion from the likes Google and Alibaba, despite no announced product for sale yet. Late last year, an article by the Information reported that investors poured money into the company after seeing impressive demonstrations of early prototypes, but the actual first commercial product will unlikely possess those same capabilities. And last week, a Business Insider article showed a widely-mocked image of what is reportedly a crude prototype of the device. \n \n In the lawsuit, Campbell said she brought up concerns that the company was showing off marketing material that didn't accurately reflect what Magic Leap's technology could actually do. The warnings were \"ignored in favor of her male colleagues\u2019 assertions that the images and videos presented on Magic Leap\u2019s website and on YouTube were 'aspirational,' and not Magic Leap\u2019s version of 'alternate facts,' \" the lawsuit said in an apparent reference to U.S. President Donald J. Trump counselor Kellyanne Conway's infamous use of the term \"alternative facts.\" \n \n Campbell joined Magic Leap in April 2015 when there were no women in leadership positions, the lawsuit said. During Campbell's initial interview at Magic Leap, she joked that the company's advertising department was a \"boys club,\" but Abovitz told her he was looking to change that. \n \n \"All the engineers and others in predominately-male Magic Leap could conceive of to make the product female friendly was to produce a version in pink,\" the lawsuit said. \n \n The company's mostly male leadership team is made up of what the lawsuit described as \"Abovitz sycophants.\" The one female leader, chief business officer Rachna Bhasin, is characterized as \"the perfect Magic Leap female employee: she went [to] Harvard, never disagrees with Abovitz and always does Abovitz's bidding even when common sense or her own experience run counter. She makes the company appear diverse and inclusive although it is not.\" \n \n In the first few months at Magic Leap, Campbell said she tried to change things. She came up with a PowerPoint presentation that outlined that only 14% of overall Magic Leap employees were female and 3% of engineering staff were female. She offered proposals to encourage more female inclusion in the short term, like recruiting from colleges with high numbers of female engineers, and in the long term, like tying bonuses to boosting diversity numbers. The lawsuit said Abovitz kept putting off these meetings, or cutting them short when they happened. \n \n Eventually, Abovitz put together the \"female brain trust initiative\" (or FBI), headed up by Bhasin, to make sure Magic Leap product design and content was developed with women in mind. The first meeting on May 18, 2016 presented a prototype with the power supply implemented in a \"belt pack,\" and recommended not having the headset connect in the back of the head, to make it easier to wear for people with long hair or ponytails. The group make no inroads and none of the proposals made it into the design process. The group was pure \"window dressing,\" the lawsuit alleged. Abovitz and other men didn't show up to later meetings. \n \n The lawsuit said three or four core apps that the standard Magic Leap headset will end up shipping with included a game called \"Dr. G,\" which had no lead female characters. The one female character is \"busty\" and depicted as groveling on her knees at the main character's feet. Campbell complained repeatedly to the designers with no success about the game's misogyny, the complaint said. \n \n Sexist attitudes were abundant at the company, the lawsuit said. In one instance, Campbell attended a conference call in September 2016 with several executives to talk with advertising agency R/GA. During the call, Magic Leap CFO Scott Henry said, \"I\u2019m sitting here between two beautiful ladies. They\u2019re not going to want to put a big ugly device over their pretty faces. And I have an office with glass doors, I don\u2019t want people to see me with these beautiful girls with ugly things on their faces,\" the complaint alleged, referring to Campbell and the company's head of operations, Tina Tuli. After the call, R/GA executives expressed concern about Henry's remarks. \n \n Campbell, who joined as head of advertising, was made vice president only after she asked for the promotion in September 2016. Campbell said in the lawsuit that this is an example of the company's leadership inability to make decisions. \n \n \"Abovitz was incapable of making decisions,\" the lawsuit said, \"but rather kept putting things off pending more meetings and assigning more people to solve the problem, which was one of the primary reasons Magic Leap could not bring its product to market.\" \n \n After the the promotion, the complaint said Campbell was marginalized in the leadership team. In her last four months, it said Abovitz \"who always had been pouty and prone to temper-tantrums, began to dig his heels in even more in the face of dissenting ideas and to explode ever more frequently into child-like fits of rage, threatening retribution when he didn\u2019t get his way, felt betrayed or was portrayed publically [sic] in an unfavorable light.\" \n \n In Campbell's final months at Magic Leap, Abovitz disinvited her from meetings. In November 2016, Abovitz told Campbell to interview employees about their opinions of the company. She told Abovitz Magic Leap should instead work towards branding for a target audience, not just employees. Regardless, Campbell followed orders and presented her findings on December 20, but was instead fired. Magic Leap offered Campbell a three-months severance if she released all claims against the company. She refused to sign. \n \n The lawsuit alleged the company's sexism has lead to dysfunction and is losing out to competitors like Microsoft's HoloLens. \"Microsoft, which employs far more females on its team, developed its similar product on a faster time line with more content that appeals to both genders,\" the complainant said. \n \n Magic Leap hasn't responded to a request for comment. \n \n Follow me on Twitter @aatilley or send me an email: atilley@forbes.com",
    "reference": "\u2013 An augmented reality startup is being sued for sex discrimination by the very female executive it hired to make it less of a \"boy's club,\" the Guardian reports. When Tannen Campbell was hired by Magic Leap in 2015, the Florida company had no women in leadership roles and its only idea to make its product female-friendly was to release a pink version, according to Forbes. The lawsuit filed by Campbell following her firing in December describes a \"macho bullying atmosphere,\" Business Insider reports. That allegedly includes tolerating sexist and offensive behavior, such as telling new hires to stay away from \"Orientals, Old People, and Ovaries\" and having the only female character in a centerpiece app \"on her knees grovelling at the heroes.\" Furthermore, Campbell alleges her efforts to change the culture at Magic Leap were consistently thwarted. The lawsuit states Campbell was asked to put together a presentation on the lack of gender diversity at the company, but it took seven months for Magic Leap's chief executive to show up for the presentation, and he left in the middle of it. Campbell says she and other female employees were ignored when giving input on the design of the product and its marketing. The lawsuit, which also alleges a hostile work environment and retaliation, claims the sexist culture at Magic Leap created a \"dysfunctional\" workplace and is part of the reason the company has yet to actually release a product despite being valued at billions of dollars."

When the index finger is shorter than the ring finger, this results in a small 2D:4D ratio, pointing to a high exposure to testosterone in the uterus. \n \n In a new study of 103 male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and 100 matched healthy male individuals, investigators found that the 2D:4D ratio may be an effective predictor of schizophrenia--there were significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio of the lengths of the second digit to the fourth digit, as well as its asymmetry, in both hands. \n \n \"Asymmetry index showed moderate discriminatory power and, therefore asymmetry index has a potential utility as a diagnostic test in determining the presence of schizophrenia,\" said Dr. Taner Oznur, co-author of the Clinical Anatomy study. \n \n ### ||||| The production of androgens (mostly testosterone) during the early fetal stage is essential for the differentiation of the male brain. Some authors have suggested a relationship between androgen exposure during the prenatal period and schizophrenia. These two separate relationships suggest that digit length ratios are associated with schizophrenia in males. The study was performed in a university hospital between October 2012 and May 2013. One hundred and three male patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to DSM\u2010IV using SCID\u2010I, and 100 matched healthy males, were admitted to the study. Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) were used to assess schizophrenia symptoms. The second digit (2D) and fourth digit (4D) asymmetry index (AI), and the right\u2010 and left\u2010hand 2D:4D ratios were calculated. All parametric data in the groups were compared using an independent t\u2010test. The predictive power of the AI was estimated by receiver operating characteristics analysis. The 2D:4D AI was statistically significantly lower in the patient group than the healthy control comparison group. There were significant differences between the schizophrenia and the control groups in respect of left 2D:4D and right 2D:4D. There was no correlation between AI, left, or right 2D:4D, BPRS, or SAPS in the schizophrenia group. However, there was a negative correlation between left 2nd digit (L2D):4D and the SANS score. Our findings support the view that the 2D:4D AI can be used as a moderate indicator of schizophrenia. Even more simply, the right or left 2D:4D can be used as an indicator.

They found \"significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups concerning the ratio ... in both hands,\" the researchers report in a press release. The findings occupy opposite ends of the spectrum: The right-hand 2D:4D ratio was \"significantly higher\" among the schizophrenia group and the left-hand ratio was \"significantly lower\"\u2014suggesting the two are opposites, perhaps because testosterone \"affects finger ratios differently as it acts in different ways on the left and right hemispheres of the brain,\" per the study.

The employee was charged with a felony of injuring an elderly individual. (KPRC) \n \n United Airlines issued an apology Tuesday after a video was released of a Houston-based employee pushing a 71-year-old passenger to the floor during an argument over a ticket. The man was left lying there motionless. \n \n The confrontation took place about two years ago but was detailed in a lawsuit filed last week in Harris County, Tex.

That man has filed a lawsuit. \n \n VIDEO: Full airport surveillance video of United worker pushing Houston passenger to ground \n \n \"This is just one of the most inhumane things I've ever seen in my life,\" attorney William Hoke said. \n \n In the video, recorded on a surveillance camera at the airport, Ronald Tigner -- a frequent flyer, father and grandfather -- is shown being pushed to the ground by a United Airlines customer service rep, right in front of the United ticket counter. \n \n After hitting his head on the ground, Tigner lies motionless with his arms splayed out and yet not one United employee bothers to bend down and talk to him. \n \n \"He violently shoves a 71-year-old man to the ground,\" Hoke said. \n \n \"Was your client knocked unconscious? Was he out?\" KPRC 2's Bill Spencer asked. \n \n \"He was. He lied there,\" Hoke said. \"He lies there lifeless for minutes. Not one employee comes to check on him.\" \n \n \"None of the United employees even bend down to see if he's OK, to see it he's alive?\" Spencer asked. \n \n VIDEO: United apologizes to passenger \n \n \"No one even went to check his pulse,\" Hoke said. \"They literally left him there like a piece of garbage.\" \n \n In fact, over the course of the nearly three-minute surveillance video, not one United employee ever appears to try to comfort the man in any way. \n \n Fifty seconds into the video, a passenger walking by stops to help, as United employees just watch. \n \n \"It was a good Samaritan, who was a nurse, that was catching a flight, ran over and said, 'Please, God. Someone call 911,'\" Hoke said. \n \n When a United worker does call 911, he doesn't say the man was pushed down, or that's he's unconscious. \n \n 911: \"What is the emergency?\" \n \n Worker: \"There's a 70-year-old male that had fallen down.\" \n \n 911: \"OK, is he awake?\" \n \n Worker: \"I don't know.\" \n \n 911: \"You know what the cause of the fall?\" \n \n Worker: \"No.\" \n \n LISTEN: 911 Call after United employee pushes customer \n \n \"It's astonishing,\" Hoke said. \"It's outrageous.\" \n \n Now Tigner is suing United Airlines, Alejandro Anastasia -- the man who pushed him -- and another United employee for negligence. \n \n Hoke claims this all began with Tigner simply asking Anastasia for a new boarding pass because the one he had was garbled. The suit claims Anastasia laughed at him and cursed at him. \n \n \"Anastasia was looking at Mr. Tigner and started smiling and said, 'Can't you see we're busy?' and there's no one in the vicinity of these two employees,\" Hoke said. \"And he tells Anastasia to wipe that smile off his face. That's when Anastasia says, 'I'll kick your (expletives)' and shoves Tigner to the ground.\" \n \n Anastasia was later charged with the felony crime of injury to an elderly individual, ordered to pay a fine, write a letter of apology and attend anger-management classes. \n \n He was fired after the incident, according to United. \n \n Alejandro Nestor Anstasia \n \n Channel 2 Investigates went to Anastasia's home, but no one answered the door. \n \n \"Mr. Anastasia, what would possess you to throw a 71-year-old man to the floor?\" Spencer had asked. \n \n Tigner is suing United Airlines for more than $1 million. \n \n \"We want people to come forward who've been treated just like Mr. Tigner and like Dr. Dao, any of the other people who've flown United and been treated this way, because this has to stop,\" Hoke said. \n \n United Airlines called Tigner's lawyer to offer an apology on Wednesday. \n \n \"(They said) they're truly sorry this happened to Mr. Tigner and they wanted me to convey that to him,\" Hoke said. \n \n United released the following statement: \n \n \"We have seen the video from 2015 that shows completely unacceptable behavior by a United employee. This employee is no longer with our company. The conduct shown here does not reflect our values or our commitment to treat all of our customers with respect and dignity.

The feckless children screamed, but still asked to eat the nuggets. \"We've brainwashed our kids so brilliantly,\" Oliver said, \"that even though they know something is disgusting and gross, they'll still eat it if it's in that friendly little shape.\" \n \n The National Chicken Council (NCC) is unimpressed by deShazo's work. \"Chicken nuggets are an excellent source of protein,\" Dr. Ashley Peterson, NCC's vice president of science and technology, told Reuters. \"Especially for kids who might be picky eaters.

Mechanically separated poultry is regulated and inspected by USDA and products containing it must declare it as an ingredient on the label. Mechanical systems prevent waste of nutritious meat and avoid the repetitive motion that would be required to perform close trimming by hand.\" ||||| NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Stand-up comedians have long joked that some things, like the actual components of chicken nuggets, are better left mysterious. \n \n Recently, Mississippi researchers found out why: two nuggets they examined consisted of 50 percent or less chicken muscle tissue, the breast or thigh meat that comes to mind when a customer thinks of \"chicken.\" \n \n The nuggets came from two national fast food chains in Jackson. The three researchers selected one nugget from each box, preserved, dissected and stained the nuggets, then looked at them under a microscope. \n \n The first nugget was about half muscle, with the rest a mix of fat, blood vessels and nerves. Close inspection revealed cells that line the skin and internal organs of the bird, the authors write in the American Journal of Medicine. \n \n The second nugget was only 40 percent muscle, and the remainder was fat, cartilage and pieces of bone. \n \n \"We all know white chicken meat to be one of the best sources of lean protein available and encourage our patients to eat it,\" lead author Dr. Richard D. deShazo of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said. \n \n \"What has happened is that some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts rather than low-fat chicken white meat, batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken,\" deShazo told Reuters Health. \n \n \"It is really a chicken by-product high in calories, salt, sugar and fat that is a very unhealthy choice. Even worse, it tastes great and kids love it and it is marketed to them.\" \n \n The nuggets he examined would be okay to eat occasionally, but he worries that since they are cheap, convenient and taste good, kids eat them often. His own grandchildren \"beg\" for chicken nuggets all the time, and he compromises by making them at home by pan-frying chicken breasts with a small amount of oil, deShazo said. \n \n \"Chicken nuggets are an excellent source of protein, especially for kids who might be picky eaters,\" said Ashley Peterson, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs for the National Chicken Council (NCC), a non-profit trade group representing the U.S. chicken industry. \n \n According to the NCC, its member producers and processors account for about 95 percent of the chicken produced in the U.S. \n \n \"This study evaluates only two chicken nugget samples out of the billions of chicken nuggets that are made every year,\" Peterson said. A sample size of two nuggets is simply too small to generalize to an entire category of food, she told Reuters Health. \n \n Two nuggets is a small sample size, deShazo acknowledged, and some chains have begun to use primarily white meat in their nuggets - just not the particular restaurants he visited. \n \n \"Chicken nuggets tend to have an elevated fat content because they are breaded and fried. But it's no secret what is in a chicken nugget - most quick service restaurants have nutritional information posted in the store or on their website,\" Peterson said. \n \n \"And every package of chicken nuggets in the grocery store by law contains an ingredient list and a complete nutritional profile, including fat content,\" she said. \n \n The brief chicken nugget exploration was not meant to be an expos\u00e9 of the chicken industry or fast food generally, but to remind consumers that \"not everything that tastes good is good for you,\" deShazo said. \n \n He and his colleagues chose not to reveal which chain restaurants they visited. \n \n Consumers aren't necessarily being misled, since much of the nutritional information they need is readily available, he said. \n \n \"We just don't take the time to understand basic nutritional facts.\" \n \n SOURCE: bit.ly/16Inpg8 American Journal of Medicine, online September 13, 2013.",

    "input": "Janet Napolitano was just three months into her tenure as secretary of Homeland Security when Matt Drudge bestowed a nickname on her: \"Big Sis.\" The nickname stuck, thanks to Drudge's perseverance. Since that first story in April 2009, the Big Sis brand has been trotted out for dozens of Napolitano stories, from the scary (\"BIG SIS: Napolitano to Kill Spy-Satellite Program\") to the silly (\"BIG SIS: Napolitano enlists Girl Scouts in effort to combat hurricanes, pandemics, terror attacks\") to\u2014most important\u2014the creepy sexual stuff about the Transportation Security Administration. In January 2010, Drudge linked to a story about the government acquiring body scanners by pressing the Caps-Lock key and breaking out a photo illustration of Napolitano eying a scan of a nude: \"BIG SIS WANTS TO SEE UNDER YOUR CLOTHES.\" \n \n Ten months later, there is a full-blown revolt against the TSA and body scanners (which are sold by a firm with the poetically unfortunate name of Rapiscan). The revolt will crest next Wednesday, with National Opt-Out Day on the busiest travel period of the year. The accidental guerilla heroico of the revolt is John Tyner, who refused a full-body scan at San Diego International Airport then refused to let TSA agents manually search him. \"You touch my junk,\" he said, \"and I'm going to have you arrested.\" \n \n What does this have to do with Matt Drudge? The Tyner Mutiny went viral because the Drudge Report gave it the blaring-siren treatment. And the site gave it the blaring-siren treatment because conservatives have been ready for a very long time to return to a familiar and comfortable opinion of Homeland Security: It must be stopped. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n That opinion was in hibernation, then partial hibernation, for a long time. Before 9/11, the prevailing conservative/libertarian/Republican opinion of the national-security state\u2014of any government effort to protect Americans at the point of a gun and the touch of a rubber glove\u2014was mistrust. The second most common opinion was fear. And the return of those emotions is a lagging reaction to the fact that Republicans no longer have to toe the party line on homeland security. They can say what they think, which is that the state can't be trusted. \n \n It's worth remembering that the idea of a cabinet-level Department of Homeland Security came from the Democratic Party just after the 9/11 attacks. (Just after 9/11, President Bush created an Office of Homeland Security within the White House.) It wasn't until 2002 that the Republican Party latched on to the concept and took ownership of it. As they pushed DHS through the House, however, Republicans made concessions that demonstrated just how ambivalent they were about the idea of a massive new national-security bureaucracy. Plans for national ID cards and a system to inform on possible terrorists were killed by Republicans like then majority leader and current Tea Party icon Dick Armey. Certain homeland security proposals, he said, were \"not consistent with a free society.\" \n \n At the time, only 12 Republicans voted against the House bill creating DHS. Most Republican candidates used their support of \"a strong DHS,\" which quickly became a byword for \"being serious about terrorism,\" to clobber Democrats who wanted the new federal workers hired to staff the new department to be unionized. This was not something conservatives believed in deeply. It was a useful\u2014and, if you ask Max Cleland, successful\u2014campaign issue. \n \n There were always critics of the strategy. They simply didn't have much pull while Bush was president. Angry criticism of the TSA, DHS, and the surveillance state came out of a rump of congressional Republicans, from think tanks and from talk radio hosts like Alex Jones and pundits like Andrew Napolitano. But none of this challenged Republicans' strategic thinking. The first victories of the conservative civil liberties crowd came in 2007 and 2008, when they successfully beat back a plan for a national ID card\u2014technically, nationally compatible state IDs\u2014that had been scrapped from the first DHS bill. \n \n Tea Party activists like to date the backlash to big government to the 2008 passage of TARP. But the backlash against the TSA started a little earlier. According to Tom Blank, the deputy administrator of TSA in the post-9/11 years, the agency was always cognizant of how unpopular scanning could be. \n \n \"I used to sit around and look at these images, dial them back, and ask myself how do I take this to Capitol Hill and not be thrown out on my head?\" said Blank. \"When [Bush's second TSA administrator] Kip Hawley came in [in 2005], he changed that. He saw the politics of it and deep-sixed the program. He deep-sixed it. It got revived after the Christmas bomber.\" \n \n The point about how full-body scanning got restarted is essential\u2014it was the Obama administration picking up an idea that Republicans had cooled on. Republicans accused the administration of degrading security by dialing back war-on-terror prosecutions in the name of human rights; the response was a security measure that would affect all travelers randomly. So maybe the Drudge Report didn't really invent a backlash against Napolitano. The backlash was inevitable. Republican trust in a sprawling and invasive security apparatus was always precarious. Its collapse leaves the TSA and the Obama administration with yet another libertarian, anti-state riot on their hands. \n \n They have the media, too, for what that's worth. Alex Altman's take on the \"hysteria\" in Time dismissed the backlash as \"tailor-made for the Internet's ephemeral obsessions\" and at odds with a Pew poll showing 81 percent of people accepting full-body scans. \"Sometimes the screams of an aggrieved minority drowns out the rest of the public,\" said Altman, \"and this may be one of those cases.\" \n \n Which may be true. Or not. In 2009, the smart take on the rage against health-care reform was that it was ephemeral, tailor-made for the aggrieved minority, a bunch of anti-government yokels screaming about a policy they didn't understand. Yet that rage clearly lasted long enough to hurt the Democrats at the polls this month. And health care reform at least had a cheering section in the liberal press. That press isn't cheering on the TSA. Democrats aren't particularly fond of the way the TSA operates. Pilots aren't happy. In an age of right-wing backlashes to the state, the only surprise is that this took so long. \n \n Like Slate on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. \n \n Like Slate Politics on Facebook.

They are objecting loudly to new airport security measures designed to detect bombs hidden under clothing. And they are blocking a Senate vote on a treaty with Russia that is critical to securing loose nukes and keeping Iran from gaining the bomb. \n \n For Democrats, the opposition's gamesmanship with the security should present an opportunity. Republicans seem to have entered a post-post-9/11 era, in which national security is no longer a higher priority than their interest in undermining President Obama. There's no need to resort to the demagoguery once used against Democrats, but neither would it hurt the White House and congressional Democrats to point out that their opponents are trying to weaken Americans' security. \n \n Let's start with START, the proposed nuclear pact with Russia that Senate Republicans such as Jon Kyl (Ariz.) are attempting to derail, at least until the next Congress. Since the expiration of the previous START treaty last December, there have been no U.S. inspectors in Russia to keep an eye on the country's thousands of nuclear warheads. If the Senate doesn't come up with the 67 votes needed for ratification, says Travis Sharp of the Center for a New American Security, there's a risk Russia will retaliate by removing its logistical support for the U.S. war in Afghanistan, abandoning its cooperation in preventing nuclear proliferation, and thwarting U.S. efforts to keep Iran from gaining nuclear weapons. \n \n But don't take his word for it. Listen to Richard Lugar, top Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations committee and one man who still puts the national interest above political considerations. \"We're talking today about the national security of the United States of America,\" he pleaded on Wednesday. \"[T]his treaty must be ratified and be ratified in this session of the Congress.... We're talking about thousands of warheads that are still there, an existential problem for our country. To temporize at this point I think is inexcusable.\" \n \n Or listen to Bob Gates, the Bush/Obama defense secretary. \"The new START treaty has the unanimous support of America's military leadership,\" he wrote in the Wall Street Journal, calling for a strong bipartisan majority to support the treaty because of \"the security it provides to the American people.\" \n \n To borrow Bush's phrase, are Republicans not interested in the security of the American people? \n \n Then there's the backlash over the new imaging and pat-downs being used to screen airport passengers for explosives. A CBS News poll found that 81 percent of Americans favor use of the new imaging machines, but Republican lawmakers feel otherwise. \n \n In the House, Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.) has already introduced legislation rescinding the new security. Meanwhile, Republican senators, rediscovering their inner civil libertarians, this week took turns criticizing Transportation Security Administration chief John Pistole over the administration's tightened security. \n \n \"I wouldn't want my wife to be touched in the way that these folks are being touched. I wouldn't want to be touched that way,\" said Sen. George LeMieux (Fla.). \"I think weve gone too far.\" \n \n Sen. Mike Johanns (Neb.) warned of a \"tipping point\" against security screening. \"Does that worry you, that maybe we're at a point here where... people just thing you've overstepped?\" \n \n Pistole reminded Johanns that \"the threats are real.\" \n \n \"I'm thinking nothing's going to change,\" Johanns complained. \n \n Pistole's response should shame Johanns and his colleagues. \"If your question is, do I understand the sensitivities of people? Yes. If you're asking, am I going to change the policies? No, because I think that it is being informed by the latest intelligence, the latest efforts by terrorists to kill our people in the air. No, I'm not going to change those policies.\" \n \n This may be the post-post-9/11 era, but Pistole, a career FBI guy, is still interested in the security of the American people.

The participants ranged in age from their early 20s to their mid-70s and included a mix of African-Americans and Caucasians. \n \n The low-carb group, which reduced their carb consumption to about 28 percent of their daily calories, lost almost three times as much weight as the low-fat dieters who got about 40 to 45 percent of their calories from carbs. \n \n The low-fat group lost about 4 pounds, whereas the low-carb group's average weight loss was almost 12 pounds. Participants in the two groups were eating about the same amount of calories. \n \n The study showed that modest reductions in carbohydrate consumption, down to about 28 to 30 percent of diet, could help tip the scales to weight loss. The makeup of the low-carb group's diet was: 28 percent carbs 40 to 43 percent fat (twice as much poly and monounsaturated compared to saturated) about 28 percent protein The makeup of the low-fat group's diet was: 28 percent fat 40 to 45 percent carbs 28 to 32 percent protein \n \n Lydia Bazzano, one of the study authors and an associate professor of epidemiology at Tulane, says she had anticipated some difference in weight loss between the two groups. But the size of the effect \u2014 the nearly 8-pound difference in weight loss \u2014 was surprising, she says. \n \n So, what kinds of meals were the low-carb dieters eating? \n \n \"Typically in the morning they were eating eggs,\" says Bazzano. Other breakfast items included small portions of high-protein, high-fiber bread, with either butter or other kinds of oily spread. \n \n As for lunch and dinner, the low-carb dieters ate lots of vegetables, salads and protein, including fish, chicken and some red meat. They had generous portions of healthy fats such as olive oils, canola and other plant-based oils. \n \n Fat accounted for a sizable part of their diet: from 40 percent to 43 percent of their total daily calories, including about 12 percent from saturated fat. \n \n Bazzano says with so many people still abiding by low-fat recommendations, a diet so high in fat might not sound like a good weight-loss strategy. \"It's not the general perception,\" she says. \n \n But, in fact, there are a spate of studies that have come to the same conclusion about the benefits of swapping a low-fat, high-carb strategy for a pattern of eating that emphasizes healthy fats and lower carbohydrate consumption. \n \n It's not just waistlines that respond. The low-carb, healthy fats approach has been shown to cut the risk of heart disease. \n \n One big study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by 30 percent, compared to a low-fat diet. \n \n Research published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which compared a low-glycemic-index diet \u2014 which minimizes refined starches \u2014 with a more traditional low-fat diet, also documented advantages. \n \n \"We saw improvements in triglycerides, [good] cholesterol, and the possibility of lower chronic inflammation\" among the lower carb group, JAMA study author David Ludwig of Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital told us. \n \n Here's the fascinating part: Ludwig also found that when people stopped eating so many refined carbohydrates, they burned off about 150 more calories per day, compared to those eating a higher carb, lower fat diet. \n \n \"Too much refined carbohydrates \u2014 white bread, white rice, potato products \u2014 all the foods that crept into our diets as we've followed the low-fat craze has undermined our metabolism,\" says Ludwig. \n \n In other words, the high-carb, low-fat pattern of eating \"caused us to become hungrier and burn off fewer calories,\" he says. \n \n What's happening in the body when we follow this pattern of eating is still the subject of much research, but Ludwig says the thinking goes like this: Eating too many carbs can overstimulate the release of insulin and direct more calories into storage in the fat cells. \n \n \"It's a double-whammy for weight gain,\" Ludwig says. \"We've been told for decades that if you don't want fat on your body, don't put fat into your body. It's a very appealing notion, but the problem is it's wrong.\" ||||| A low-carbohydrate diet is better for losing weight and may also be better for lowering the risk of heart disease than a low-fat diet, according to a new study. \n \n While low-carb diets have outperformed other diets when it comes to weight loss, some researchers feared they might be worse for heart health because they tend to be high in fat. \n \n The new study shows that with proper nutritional counseling, people can lose more weight and lower their risk factors for heart disease on a low-carbohydrate diet, said the lead author, Dr. Lydia Bazzano of Tulane University in New Orleans. \n \n \"This study shows if you are overweight and have cardiovascular disease risk factors and haven't had success on other diets, certainly a low-carbohydrate diet is worth a try,\" said Bazzano. \n \n Carbohydrates are found in food and include sugar, fiber and starches that give the body energy. Some carbs - like those in whole grains and fruits - are healthier than others - like those in white bread and other processed foods. \n \n Bazzano and her colleagues write in Annals of Internal Medicine that low-carb diets have become popular weight loss strategies in recent years. Studies on their effects on cardiovascular risk factors have produced mixed results, however. \n \n For the new study, she and her colleagues recruited 148 obese men and women between the ages of 22 and 75. None of the participants had heart disease or diabetes. \n \n Half were randomly assigned to follow a low-carbohydrate diet for a year, and the other half were assigned to a low-fat diet for a year. They were told to not change their physical activity throughout the trial. \n \n All participants attended regular meetings where they learned about portion control, healthy eating and overall nutrition. They were also offered one meal-replacement bar or shake per day. \n \n The only difference between the groups was the proportions of carbohydrate and fat in their diets. \n \n Those in the low-carbohydrate group were told to eat at no more than 40 grams of digestible carbohydrates per day. (\"Digestible carbs\" equals total carbs minus total fiber.) \n \n Those in the low-fat group were told not to get more than 30 percent of their daily energy from fat and no more than 55 percent of their daily energy from carbohydrates. \n \n Overall, about four of every five participants were still following the diets 12 months later. \n \n During that time, the researchers found, people on the low-carbohydrate diet lost more weight and more body fat than those on the low-fat diet. \n \n The difference in lost weight between the two groups would represent about eight additional pounds. \n \n Additionally, the researchers saw no increases in total cholesterol or \"bad\" LDL cholesterol between the two groups. Bazzano said that's good news since some thought a low-carbohydrate diet would increase cholesterol levels. \n \n Those in the low-carbohydrate group had lower levels of fat circulating in their blood and had lower scores on a measure often used to predict the risk of a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years. \n \n \"I thought that was a very striking finding,\" Bazzano said. She added that the score that predicts risk of future heart attacks and strokes was computed after the study was finished and is less reliable than the other risk factors they measured. \n \n Dr. David Jenkins, who wasn't involved in the study, told Reuters Health, \"This doesn\u2019t look to me to say 'eat all the meats you want to lower your carbohydrates.' That\u2019s just one way to do it.\" \n \n Instead, Jenkins said, people in this study appeared to improve their overall diets. For example, they were eating foods with healthier fats, such as nuts and beans. \n \n He also said they seemed to eat more fiber and cut down on processed foods with more carbohydrates. \n \n \"I think it\u2019s another testament to what one can do with a more plant-based diet using the right macronutrient profile,\" said Jenkins of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Toronto and the Keenan Research Centre at St. Michael's Hospital. \n \n Bazzano agreed that the overall diets improved among the participants and they were encouraged to eat healthier forms of protein like chicken, fish, nuts and beans. \n \n She also said her team is not sure why people on the low-carbohydrate diets lost more weight and had lower risk factors for heart disease after one year. It's not clear, she added,if there would still be a difference after a longer period. \n \n SOURCE: bit.ly/1qjI8OG Annals of Internal Medicine, online September 1, 2014.",

Refined carbohydrates\u2014found in processed foods like white breads, white rice, and pastas\u2014tend to be loaded with sugar, which messes with our metabolisms, making it harder to burn calories. Eating nearly half your calories via healthy fats, on the other hand\u2014think salmon, avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils\u2014has been shown in a recent study to result in twice as much weight loss as seen in those assigned to low-fat diets. \"It's a double-whammy for weight gain,\" one researcher tells NPR. \"We've been told for decades that if you don't want fat on your body, don't put fat into your body.

It remains unclear precisely why people on lower-carb diets not only lost more weight but had lower heart disease risk factors. It's something the researchers say will need to be studied more and for longer than the one-year period of this investigation.

Most observers had expected the device to arrive next month. \n \n Sprint will get both the new iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4 but it's unclear just how many new subscribers Sprint will be able to reel in come this fall, MarketWatch's Dan Gallagher reports on Markets Hub. (Photo: AP Photo.) \n \n The deal could help prop up the nation's third-largest carrier and give AT&T Inc. more ammunition in its attempt to win regulatory approval for its proposed acquisition of No. 4 U.S. carrier T-Mobile USA Inc. \n \n Verizon Wireless and AT&T, the two largest wireless carriers, measured by subscribers, will begin selling the phone in mid-October as well, according to two people familiar with the matter. \n \n Sprint had more than 52 million subscribers at the end of the second quarter, compared with 106 million for Verizon and nearly 99 million for AT&T. \n \n Sprint will begin selling the iPhone 5 in mid-October, closing a huge hole in the No. 3 U.S. carrier's lineup and giving Apple another channel for selling its popular phone. Spencer Ante has details on The News Hub. \n \n Landing the iPhone is a big win for Sprint, whose results have suffered without being able to sell the trend-setting device. AT&T has relied on versions of the Apple device to drive sales since 2007. This February, Verizon Wireless began selling the iPhone 4. Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications Inc. and Vodafone Group PLC. \n \n In the second quarter, Sprint blamed a decline in its contract subscribers on more pronounced \"competitive headwinds,\" most prominently, \"the first full quarter both major competitors offered the iPhone.\" \n \n Sprint will also carry the iPhone 4, starting at the same time, one person familiar with the situation said. \n \n Richard Doherty, director of the research firm Envisioneering Group, said that the addition of the iPhone would help Sprint retain many of its customers itching to upgrade. The iPhone will also increase foot traffic in Sprint stores, which should help the company to sell high-margin iPhone accessories. \"Sprint needs it,\" said Mr. Doherty. \"There are a lot of families that will embrace the iPhone.\" \n \n That said, the deal could also hurt Sprint by helping AT&T improve its chances of winning approval from regulators for its $39 billion purchase of T-Mobile USA, said Marc Ostrau, a partner and co-chair of the antitrust and unfair competition group at law firm Fenwick & West. \n \n \"It not only is likely to give Sprint a boost but also puts more focus on the increasing importance of device suppliers relative to carriers,\" said Mr. Ostrau. \n \n Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, said a Sprint iPhone would probably help AT&T's efforts, but he said the impact depends on how much regulators determine the deal curbs AT&T's ability to raise prices without losing too many sales. \n \n \"The question is how much more competition do you get when you have two rivals rather than one,\" said Mr. Hovenkamp. \n \n The cellphone business is increasingly driven by hot smartphones, which are growing more sophisticated and expensive. Apple commanded an average of more than $650 apiece for its iPhones last quarter. Carriers subsidize the difference between that cost and the phone's $199 or $299 retail price, hoping to make up the difference with the data plans they sell over the course of two-year contracts customers must sign to get the subsidy. \n \n Apple created additional leverage for itself by signing exclusive deals when it first launched the iPhone in 2007. In recent years, the company has changed strategy, inking deals with multiple carriers in countries around the world. \n \n The new iPhone is expected to be similar to the current iPhone 4, but thinner and lighter with an improved digital camera and a new more sophisticated operating system. \n \n Apple said in June that a new version of its mobile operating system would be available this fall, leading many analysts to conclude that an upgraded iPhone would be introduced at the same time. \n \n On a July earnings conference call, Apple Chief Financial Officer Peter Oppenheimer said the company's September quarter would be affected by \"a future product transition that we are not going to talk about today,\" increasing anticipation. \n \n While Apple unveiled the iPhone 4 at its June developers' conference last year, its successor wasn't ready in time for this year, according to a person briefed on Apple's product plans. The company then aimed to launch a new iPhone by the end of September, though two people familiar with the situation previously told The Wall Street Journal that the phone could be delayed again if its contract manufacturer couldn't improve its production yield rate. \n \n Enlarge Image Close Bloomberg News Sprint, fighting to turn itself around after its disastrous merger with Nextel last decade, has managed to stem subscriber defections and improve customer service.

But it has disappointed investors by failing to add new subscribers more quickly, in part because it competes with rivals that carry Apple's fast-selling phone. \n \n Verizon Wireless, which cracked AT&T's exclusive U.S. hold on the iPhone this year, has sold 4.5 million of the Apple devices in the first half of 2011. \n \n AT&T, which is also able to sell a cheaper prior version of the iPhone, has sold 7.2 million this year. \n \n \u2014Yukari Iwatani Kane contributed to this article. \n \n Write to Joann S. Lublin at joann.lublin@wsj.com ||||| With the iPhone 5 possibly on its way to Sprint Nextel, could the end of its much-loved unlimited-data plan be far behind? \n \n commentary Once Sprint Nextel gets the iPhone, you can bid farewell to its unlimited-data plan. \n \n Sprint CEO Dan Hesse, as seen in one of the company's much-played black-and-white television commercials. (Credit: CBS/Sprint) \n \n If history is any indication, Sprint will have to make some tough decisions, if Apple's blockbuster device starts weighing on its network. It's something the other carriers have done, and it's part of a broader trend of telecommunication companies struggling to keep up with growing bandwidth consumption. \n \n After suffering through years of heavy bandwidth usage from iPhone users, AT&T; relented and switched to a tiered pricing plan last year. It only took Verizon Wireless a few months after launching its version of the iPhone 4 before it opted to apply similar data caps. \n \n Sprint, which The Wall Street Journal reported today will be getting the iPhone 5 at the same time as AT&T; and Verizon in October, will likely follow the same path. \n \n I have no first-hand knowledge of Sprint's thinking on its successful--but taxing--offer of an all-you-can-eat data plan for its smartphones. A Sprint representative wasn't immediately available to answer my questions. \n \n But I do know that networks aren't fundamentally different from each other, despite the marketing jargon and hype that surrounds them. Sprint doesn't have any more capacity than Verizon and AT&T.; In fact, it may be in a worse position now because its unlimited-data offer is unique in the market, likely attracting the heaviest of users. \n \n The carriers' switch to tiered plans doesn't include existing unlimited-data customers, who have had the option to be grandfathered into an unlimited plan. You can see the strain the grandfathering is putting on the carriers, with both AT&T; and Verizon switching to language in their service agreements that allow them to throttle, or choke off, the connection speed when a user exceeds a certain threshold of data consumption. \n \n Sprint is in a touchy spot because it has positioned itself as the unlimited carrier. Ads talk about the company's truly limitless plans, and Chief Executive Dan Hesse has been featured on commercials deriding competitors' actions such as throttling. \n \n As I've written, Verizon's decision to switch to a capped plan has been a boon for Sprint. The carrier is the only remaining company to offer a truly unlimited-data plan, a rare marketing and competitive edge outside of cheaper prices. Even Sprint's prepaid arm, Virgin Mobile, has decided to employ throttling. \n \n But all good things have to come to an end. Speaking to a roundtable of bloggers and reporters last month, Hesse acknowledged that data traffic could eventually be an issue. \n \n \"Nothing's a guarantee that it's forever,\" he said at the time. \n \n For Sprint, the choice is a trade-off: keep the unlimited-data plan and spur additional customer growth, or cut back on the plans and ease the need to invest in more capital for the network. Its decision may indicate whether it is favoring the consumer or Wall Street. \n \n When I wrote about Sprint eventually dropping the unlimited-data plan, analysts gave it a year to 18 months before a change would happen. But with the iPhone becoming available to Sprint customers, that timetable could be accelerated. Thanks to its more affordable data plans, Sprint has a higher base of smartphone customers than its rivals--roughly half of its total customers. \n \n While it has gotten used to dealing with the bandwidth-intensive Android phone, Sprint may be in for another pounding, once more customers start upgrading their basic phones for the iPhone. \n \n And even if the iPhone isn't significantly more data-hungry than its Android counterparts, Sprint may use the iPhone's reputation as an excuse to close off the unlimited-data spigot. \n \n So what does that mean for customers? If the iPhone does come out for Sprint, hop on an unlimited-data plan while you can (and thus get grandfathered in). The plan may not be around much longer.",
    "reference": "\u2013 The iPhone 5 will be available on Sprint's network as well as Verizon's and AT&T's when the new phone is launched, insiders tell the Wall Street Journal. The device will hit the market in mid-October, not next month as many had expected, the sources say. The iPhone 5 deal will provide a major boost for the nation's third-largest carrier, whose bottom line had suffered without the ability to sell iPhones, analysts say. The deal, however, could end up backfiring on Sprint if it improves AT&T's chances of getting the green light from regulators to buy T-Mobile USA. Verizon ditched its unlimited plans not long after it launched its version of the iPhone 4 earlier this year, notes Roger Cheng at CNET, who recommends that Sprint users hop on unlimited data plans now to get \"grandfathered in\" before the Sprint iPhone arrives."

    "input": "Neil Patrick Harris' hot streak as the 21st century awards-show answer to Johnny Carson hit a few speed bumps with this year's wildly hit-or-miss television honors. \n \n Jeff Daniels beat out Bryan Cranston. Bobby Cannavale trumped Aaron Paul. Tony Hale mopped the floor with the Modern Family guys. And Stephen Colbert finally nudged out Jon Stewart for variety-show supremacy. So with so many unexpected wins, why was the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards telecast such a bloated bore? Chalk it up to tonal inconsistency? Misconceived production numbers? Too many protracted pretaped segments at the expense of spontaneity? An overload of solemnity? \n \n Perhaps Don Cheadle inadvertently hit it on the head during a look back a half-century to the momentous events of 1963, when he acknowledged \u201ctelevision\u2019s active role in allowing us to mourn collectively and begin to heal.\u201d That\u2019s a noble sentiment in the intended context of the John F. Kennedy assassination. But in such a moribund ceremony, any mention of mourning felt awkwardly appropriate. It didn\u2019t take the Breaking Bad meth dancers -- yes, really -- to point up the uncomfortable paradox of television\u2019s best being celebrated in a night of spectacularly messy TV. \n \n PHOTOS: Emmys' Best and Worst Moments \n \n As the man in the firing line, Neil Patrick Harris will likely cop a lot of flak. But with so many blundering producing decisions intruding on his limited time at the podium, the host didn\u2019t really stand a chance. \n \n Harris has four lauded turns as Tony Awards emcee under his belt, plus a previous gig fronting the Emmys in 2009. He knows what he\u2019s doing. His insouciant irreverence hit the mark in an intro segment in which he binge-watched the entire TV season. Ditto when his opening monologue was hijacked by previous hosts (Jimmy Kimmel, Jane Lynch, Jimmy Fallon, Conan O\u2019Brien) and by front-row hecklers Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, demanding that he strip down and start twerking. Making that sabotage part of the master plan of Kevin Spacey, in character as House of Cards\u2019 reptilian Frank Underwood, was a droll touch. And somehow Harris\u2019 humor and charm failed to provide much glue. (Truth be told, he was also part of the producing team, which makes him far from blameless.) \n \n The expected opening song-and-dance number failed to materialize until midshow. By the time it did, the mood had been so thoroughly flattened that Harris, 16 back-up dancers, Nathan Fillion and Sarah Silverman faced an uphill battle to milk much amusement out of the routine glitz of \u201cThe Number in the Middle of the Show.\u201d Even worse was the choreography segment, with a faux-reality setup leading to thematic dance numbers for each of the drama nominees -- a throwback to the good old, bad old days when Debbie Allen choreographed the Oscars. \n \n PHOTOS: Emmys Red Carpet Arrivals \n \n When Harris\u2019 How I Met Your Mother castmates turned up in a pretaped mock-infomercial for The Ryan Seacrest Center for Excessive Hosting Disorder, dragging in Arsenio Hall as part of their intervention, the irony was agonizing. \n \n Too often, such labored filler segments merely ate up time, meaning the award recipients were played off almost as soon as they began speaking. Shorter acceptance speeches normally are a good thing, a memo that Nurse Jackie winner Merritt Wever appeared to have gotten with her succinct: \u201cThank you so much. I gotta go. Bye.\u201d But a few more discursive comments might have helped stave off the weird pall that hung over much of the ceremony. \n \n In one inspired bit early on, Hale returned to the stage soon after his supporting actor in a comedy win for Veep, sycophantically flanking his \u201cboss,\u201d Julia Louis-Dreyfus, when she was honored for the same show. Cutting to their co-star Anna Chlumsky madly texting in the audience only made the joke funnier. Michael Douglas also scored some laughs with his innuendo-laden acceptance speech for Behind the Candelabra, acknowledging that the movie was a \u201ctwo-hander\u201d and giving his co-star Matt Damon the choice of \u201cthe bottom or the top\u201d for his half of the award. Gracious remarks by class acts such as James Cromwell and Ellen Burstyn were like invigorating breaths of fresh air -- likewise the welcome appearances of Bob Newhart, who showed that less is more. \n \n PHOTOS: THR's Emmys Instagram Photos \n \n But every moment of genuine levity had to contend with another deep plunge into self-important sobriety. Spreading the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d salutes throughout the show was a large part of that problem, laying such a thick carpet of gloom that it made much of Harris\u2019 material seem smug. \n \n During the runup to Sunday\u2019s ceremony, news that Glee star Cory Monteith was to be given a special tribute prompted some discontent, suggesting that, by contrast, lumping such iconic faces as Jack Klugman and Larry Hagman into the collective obit was doing those TV veterans a disservice. But it was impossible not to be moved by the heartfelt sincerity of Jane Lynch\u2019s salute to her late Glee co-star. \n \n Other tributes included Michael J. Fox\u2019s bow to Family Ties creator Gary David Goldberg; Robin Williams\u2019 nod to fellow comedian Jonathan Winters, with whom he worked on Mork & Mindy; Edie Falco\u2019s tearful farewell to her Sopranos husband James Gandolfini; and most affecting of all, Rob Reiner\u2019s loving words for his All in the Family mother-in-law, Jean Stapleton. In a year of countless sad losses for television, the Emmys clearly set out to acknowledge the passing of key figures who touched different generations. The intention was honorable, even if some major names ended up seeming like also-rans. But the complete absence of clips from either the standalone tributes or the group acknowledgement robbed them of emotional resonance. \n \n PHOTOS: Emmys Fashion: The Top 10 Best Dressed \n \n The 1963 remembrance was too rushed to have much impact, playing like a promo for a more interesting PBS special. The first-ever African-American Emmy acting nominee, Diahann Carroll, appeared onstage with this year\u2019s contender Kerry Washington to acknowledge how far television had come in terms of racial inclusiveness. But again, this gesture was more symbolic than meaningful. \n \n In the evening\u2019s most anticipated musical interlude, Elton John donned one of his old glittery Captain Fantastic jackets to pay tribute to Liberace. But the choice of a forgettable new song with only the most tenuous connection to the Behind the Candelabra subject made this another black hole in a ceremony littered with them. \n \n The big drag at the Emmys has always been the deja vu factor of the same winners year after year. Claire Danes again? Jim Parsons again? And despite edgier contenders in Louie, Girls and Veep, another best comedy win for Modern Family was gruesomely inevitable. Given that USA is about to start syndicating season-one reruns of that sitcom -- the last time the show\u2019s writing really excelled -- the ho-hum award felt somehow right. \n \n This was an Emmy telecast so plodding, lifeless and just plain glum that even the overdue best drama win for Breaking Bad failed to provide a lift at the end of the show. ||||| \"Modern Family\" creator Steven Levitan summed up the 65th Primetime Emmy Awards telecast when he accepted another outstanding comedy award for the show.\"This may be the saddest Emmys of all time, but we could not be happier,\" he said.The CBS telecast, hosted with gusto by Neil Patrick Harris, was smothered by five \"in memoriam\" tributes to individuals as well as a montage late in the telecast. It was, in a word, a bummer.Harris tried to bring up the energy with jokes and a mid-broadcast song-and-dance number called \"The Number in the Middle of the Show.\" But nothing seemed to help. Every time the show got moving, a tribute cast a pall over the proceedings.Most of the presenter banter was strained and only a few acceptance speeches drew laughs. Here are the night's best moments, which were few. (Click through the gallery at top of page for images from the telecast.)Accepting the variety series Emmy for \"The Colbert Report,\" Colbert cracked, \"It's a cliche to say it's an honor just to be nominated. It's more than that; it's also a lie.

He whispered names and comments into her ear so she could complete her speech.Merritt Wever, a surprise supporting actress winner for \"Nurse Jackie,\" was rendered pretty much speechless, thus delivering the night's most honest and brief acceptance. \"Thank you so much,\" she said. \"I gotta go. Bye.\"Amy Poehler and Tina Fey show why they are the funniest ladies of the moment, again. During Harris' opening skit in which past hosts offered him advice, the women cat call him from the audience with comments like,\"Take your pants off! And twerk it!\" When he said that would be degrading, Poehler responded, \"It might be degrading, but we would be de-grateful.\"Diahann Carroll, who was the first African-American to win in Emmy way back when, showed she's still a pro. \"It's been such a long time since I've been standing in this place, I don't know what to do,\" Carroll said. \"But the men are much more beautiful than when I was doing television. I don't know where you came from, but I'm very happy to see you.\" ||||| First, our apologies: we may have hyped this year\u2019s Emmy Awards as a lighter Sunday-night-programming alternative to Breaking Bad. Aside from the trophies, and the odd sexual-innuendo-tinged acceptance speech from Michael Douglas, however, the vibe inside the Nokia Theater\u2019s Emmydome was not that upbeat. (To quote Patton Oswalt: \u201cThat was one soul-crushing slab of televised darkness. Over on cable, however, @BreakingBad_AMC was amazing.\u201d) How could it be, with the steady stream of in-memoriam segments that stopped just long enough for a series of less relevant downers including, but not limited to, a Beatles cover performed by Carrie Underwood, a U.S.-history lesson from Don Cheadle, and a tribute to Liberace by Elton John? It was all so torturous that when Bob Newhart interrupted the downcast proceeding, we don\u2019t even remember what for, Al Pacino\u2014looking as though he had just roused himself from a two-hour slumber\u2014led the audience in a standing ovation, as if to say, \u201cYay for the living!\u201d \n \n \n \n But somewhere in all of that Emmy muckety-muck, there were some genuinely brilliant surprises. The first being Merritt Wever\u2019s very deserved, but very unexpected, win in the supporting-actress-in-a-comedy category for her work on Nurse Jackie. Up against Modern Family favorites Sof\u00eda Vergara and Julie Bowen, the young actress was so shocked by the win that all she could mutter at the podium was, \u201cThanks so much. I gotta go, bye.\u201d A close second in the awesome-acceptance-speech department came from Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who collected her comedic-actress Emmy with Veep co-star (and supporting comedic-actor winner) Tony Hale in tow. Assuming the role of Gary, Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s aide on the HBO series, Hale stood behind her while she accepted her Emmy to hold her bag (a recurring Veep joke) and remind her to thank her family. \n \n Joining Wever with their own surprise wins were Jeff Daniels in the dramatic-actor category (where he was up against such heavy-hitting nominees as Mad Men\u2019s Jon Hamm, Breaking Bad\u2019s Bryan Cranston, and Homeland\u2019s Damian Lewis) and Boardwalk Empire\u2019s Bobby Cannavale in the dramatic-supporting-actor race (which featured Breaking Bad\u2019s Aaron Paul, Homeland\u2019s Mandy Patinkin, and Game of Thrones\u2019 Peter Dinklage). Like last year, Modern Family won the best-comedy-series title, and Claire Danes took the best-dramatic-actress award for Homeland. In groundbreaking developments, Netflix secured its first Emmy, for direction of a drama series, which went to David Fincher for House of Cards. Michael Douglas predictably took the best-actor-in-a-miniseries-or-movie trophy for his portrayal of Liberace in HBO\u2019s Behind the Candelabra. Explaining that he wanted to split his award with co-star Matt Damon, who played Liberace\u2019s real-life lover Scott Thorson, Douglas joked, \u201cMatt, you really deserve half of this. So do you want the bottom or the top?\u201d \n \n \n \n Breaking Bad won two awards\u2014supporting actress in a drama series for Anna Gunn and the top drama title at the end of the night. Sadly for Game of Thrones fans, this meant that neither Emilia Clarke nor the fantasy show won in their nominated categories. Similarly defeated was Mad Men, which unfathomably failed to clinch a single award tonight. While on the subject of injustices, it seems unfair to tease Emmy viewers with several minutes\u2019 worth of Tina Fey and Amy Poehler\u2014who appeared early in the telecast to heckle host Neil Patrick Harris\u2014only to leave us with three relentlessly depressing hours of programming. \n \n \n \n Meanwhile, it bears noting that Neil Patrick Harris\u2014a consummate pro\u2014expertly M.C.\u2019d the proceedings, brightening them up wherever he could. Unfortunately for him, Emmy producers had a somewhat dour agenda for the evening, which left this viewer, at least, feeling like one of the night\u2019s biggest losers. ||||| We don\u2019t ask much of the Primetime Emmy Awards. Nobody ever gets one of these three-hour statuette dispensaries completely right, but the Emmys always seem as though they\u2019d be the easiest of all the awards shows to pull off \u2014 mostly because the likelihood of culturally disruptive twerking is very, very low, which means the Emmys are the awards show no one ever remembers 18 hours later. \n \n So what happened Sunday night during CBS\u2019s anemic and often awkward Emmys telecast, hosted by Neil Patrick Harris? (Or let me put it another way: I had to next-day \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d for this?) \n \n Everyone\u2019s favorite messed-up meth saga did at last win the best drama award, so the night wasn\u2019t a total wash, but all those highfalutin theses about the Netflix-y future of television failed to materialize. Claire Danes won lead actress (drama) for Showtime\u2019s \u201cHomeland\u201d for the second year in a row, and, inexplicably, Jeff Daniels won lead actor (drama) for HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Newsroom.\u201d \n \n \u201cModern Family\u201d won best comedy series for what seems like the squillionth time, but it is really just the fourth. HBO\u2019s Washington-based comedy \u201cVeep\u201d took two acting awards \u2014 Tony Hale for supporting actor, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus for lead actress the second straight year. And Anna Gunn won for supporting actress (drama) for AMC\u2019s \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d \n \n That\u2019s most of the news, now for the snooze, starting with a dreary opening sketch that featured Harris locking himself in a multi-screen chamber to binge the entire 2012-13 season of every television show in a matter of minutes. \n \n 1 of 57 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad \u00d7 Emmys red carpet fashion: View Photos Buttoned-up gowns felt fresh compared with the amount of skin seen on carpets of late. \u2014 Cara Kelly Caption A hint of modesty infused the red carpet at the 65th annual Emmy Awards on Sunday night.

The joke just got staler when an unamused Kevin Spacey, the star of Netflix\u2019s hit \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d turned and addressed the camera as House Majority Whip Francis Underwood, his fictional character from the show. \n \n Later, Harris\u2019s \u201cHow I Met Your Mother\u201d co-stars confronted him in an intervention for \u201cEHD\u201d (excessive hosting disorder), treatable only at the \u201cRyan Seacrest Center for Excessive Hosting.\u201d \n \n Halfway through the evening, Harris finally brought out the jaunty song-and-dance routines, the main symptom of his EHD, with a number called \u201cThe Number in the Middle of the Show.\u201d (Sample lyric: \u201cThe Emmy Awards are three hours long / Now there\u2019s three minutes less to go.\u201d) One can\u2019t imagine a flashier way to demonstrate that Hollywood\u2019s awards-show writers desperately need to think of a way to tell jokes that aren\u2019t about telling jokes; to stage a show that\u2019s not only about the show. \n \n The best line of the evening came very early on from Merritt Wever, who seemed so shocked at winning the supporting actress Emmy for a comedy show (\u201cNurse Jackie\u201d) that she went with her flusteredness and said: \u201cI gotta go, bye.\u201d \n \n The rest of us (well, some of us) gotta stay, alas, in a listless position on the couch while the Emmys poked along as flatly as possible. The banter had no flair for comedy. The tributes \u2014 including short monologues from Robin Williams, Rob Reiner, Michael J. Fox and Jane Lynch (honoring the recent deaths of comic actor Jonathan Winters, \u201cAll in the Family\u2019s\u201d Jean Stapleton, producer Gary David Goldberg and \u201cGlee\u2019s\u201d Cory Monteith) sometimes seemed stiff and, most curiously, clip-less. \n \n Lynch said that Monteith was \u201ca beautiful soul. He was not perfect, which many of us here can relate to. . . . Tonight we remember Cory for all he was and mourn the loss of what he could have been.\u201d That was supposed to be one of the evening\u2019s most moving moments, and it only sort of was. Edie Falco also encountered a similar struggle in a tribute to \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d star James Gandolfini, trying to make what was on the teleprompter sound as authentic as the pain she so clearly feels at losing a friend. \n \n More strangeness: Elton John performed a song that he said was a tribute to Liberace, which is topical because of all the nominations for HBO\u2019s \u201cBehind the Candelabra,\u201d a film didn\u2019t exactly leave everyone who saw it with a warm feeling about the flamboyant pianist. (\u201cBehind the Candelabra\u201d went on to win three big awards, for best miniseries/movie, best director for Steven Soderbergh and best actor for its star Michael Douglas, who tried to perk up his acceptance speech with jokes about gay sex.)

One big problem: The In Memoriam segments that seemed to arrive every 20 minutes or so. A sampling of the reactions: The \"steady stream of in-memoriam segments ... stopped just long enough for a series of less relevant downers including, but not limited to, a Beatles cover performed by Carrie Underwood, a US-history lesson from Don Cheadle, and a tribute to Liberace by Elton John,\" writes Julie Miller in Vanity Fair, calling the proceedings \"torturous\" and \"relentlessly depressing.\" The CBS telecast \"was, in a word, a bummer,\" writes Curt Wagner in the Chicago Tribune. Host Neil Patrick Harris \"tried to bring up the energy ... but nothing seemed to help. Every time the show got moving, a tribute cast a pall over the proceedings.\" The opening sketch was \"dreary,\" the first onstage piece \"tiresome,\" and the whole thing \"anemic and often awkward,\" writes Hank Stuever in the Washington Post. All the jokes seemed to be about the show itself, and then there were the bits that were included because ... why? No one seems to know (think the aforementioned Carrie Underwood performance). \"So, to sum up: An awards show filled with skits about how bad awards shows are gave awards to people who talked about how bad the show turned out, while everyone on Twitter had decided that hours earlier.\" There were lots of unexpected wins, but even so, the whole thing was \"a bloated bore,\" writes David Rooney in the Hollywood Reporter. The \"overload of solemnity\" and \"self-important sobriety\" was part of the problem, but the \"labored filler segments\" were also pretty bad\u2014especially considering they were the reason the \"award recipients were played off virtually as soon as they began speaking.\" Even a long-overdue best drama win for Breaking Bad couldn't save this \"plodding, lifeless, and just plain glum\" show. Everyone agrees, however, Merritt Wever's acceptance speech was a total highlight."

(Associated Press) \n \n A dime made in 1873 has cost someone a pretty penny: It sold for $1.6 million at auction. \n \n An anonymous bidder won the pristine coin, said Chris Napolitano, president of Stack's Bowers Galleries, which auctioned it during an American Numismatic Association convention. With a 15 percent buyer's fee tacked on, the final price for the coin was $1.84 million, he said. \n \n The rare coin was minted in Carson City, Nev., during a one-day run of dimes. \n \n \"Generally speaking, in the coin auction business, you might get a couple of people fighting each other\" as they bid, he said Friday. \"On this one, we had four or five buyers over a million dollars. We had a fair amount of buyers pursuing it.\" \n \n The 1873-CC \"No Arrows\" Liberty Seated dime was auctioned Thursday night. It's part of the Battle Born Collection, which contained one of every coin struck in Carson City before the mint there closed in 1893. \n \n All 111 pieces were auctioned off Thursday night, fetching a total of nearly $10 million. \n \n ___ \n \n Online: \n \n Stack's Bowers: http://stacksbowers.com/ ||||| Add up their face value, and the 111 rare coins in the \"Battle Born Collection\" amount to under $600. \n \n But throw in their lure to coin enthusiasts - each struck in the Carson City Mint between 1870 and 1893 with the most prized coin the only known 1873 \"No Arrows\" Seated Liberty dime to exist - and the price tag soars. \n \n Their owner, an anonymous Nevadan, could earn $11 million-$15 million at auction next week in Philadelphia, and a Reno coin dealer assisting him in the process says it will be a once-in-a-lifetime event. \n \n \"This is my Olympic moment,\" Rusty Goe, owner of Southgate Coins, said Tuesday of the upcoming sale, part of the Rarities Night Auction at the American Numismatic Association's World's Fair of Money Convention. \"This is the biggest event that's ever happened to me in my 30-year career as a coin collector.\" \n \n Goe serves as a paid consultant to the collection's owner, whom Goe refers to only as \"Mr. Battle Born\" after Nevada's state motto. \n \n Until the coins are sold individually at auction, they remain the only complete collection of coins made in the Carson City Mint, Goe said. They represent each of the 111 different date-and-denomination combinations issued from the Mint before it closed in 1893 in what is now the home of the Nevada State Museum. \n \n The coins range from $5, $10 and $20 gold pieces to silver dollars, half-dollars, quarters, 20-cent pieces and, what Goe describes as the \"king coin,\" the dime featuring a seated liberty figure with a crucial feature: no arrows on each side of the 1873 stamp. \n \n As the only known survivor of 12,400 coins minted, Goe said, it alone could fetch anywhere from $1.5 million to $4 million. \n \n He should know: He once owned the dime, he said, buying it in 2004 for $891,250 and later selling it to the current owner for $1 million. \n \n \"It's the show-stopper, the cornerstone of the collection,\" Goe said. \"I got a good deal on it and I passed a good deal on to Mr. Battle Born.\" \n \n The auction's success could be affected by potential buyers' confidence at the moment with market conditions, Goe said, adding, \"We just won't know for sure until then. We'll see how close we come to our pre-sale estimates.\" \n \n Either way, Goe hopes to use the event as a showcase for Nevada and the Carson City Mint's opening at the height of the Comstock Lode era. \n \n He's already convinced Stack's Bowers Galleries of Irvine, Calif., which will put on the auction, to print a separate catalog on the Battle Born Collection in addition to the main publication for participants. \n \n And Goe has written articles for Coin World magazine and helped Stack's Bowers organize a seven-city tour of the collection over the past year leading up to next Thursday's auction. \n \n He also said a bit of historic irony has not been lost: The Philadelphia Mint, the nation's first opened in 1792, opposed creating a Carson City branch when the issue was debated in Congress in the 1860s. \n \n \"They said, why do we want to put a mint in that heathen territory, a Wild West area like that? So for this one night, Carson City will steal the show from the Philadelphia Mint,\" he said.",

The least sexually satisfied people are those who are single and looking for a relationship; only 40% are satisfied. Single people are also more likely to choose not to divulge information about their sex life. \n \n \n \n The survey also shows that general satisfaction increases with age among men but stays relatively stable among women. However, for both men and women, 25-30 year olds are most likely to report that they are \u2018very satisfied\u2019 with their sex life. \n \n \n \n \n \n (Results from Dalia\u2019s study of European relationships can be seen here) \n \n *Correction: This post previously listed the results as representative of ages 14-65, however, in this survey only results from ages 18-65 are presented. \n \n Header image by Charlie Foster ||||| ANN ARBOR, MI - While monogamous relationships are considered by many to be the cornerstone of love and happiness, a new University of Michigan study indicates that those in consensual open relationships are just as satisfied. \n \n The study, led by UM Associate Professor of Psychology and Women's Studies Terri Conley, showed that heterosexuals in consensual open relationships reported high levels of satisfaction and trust, as well as low levels of jealousy. \n \n \n \n \"Overall, the outcomes for monogamous and consensual nonmonogamous participants were the same - indicating no net benefit of one relationship style over another,\" said Conley, in a news release. \n \n \n \n Conley and colleagues conducted analyses of different relationships among participants older than age 25. The sample included 2,124 people - including 1,507 individuals in monogamous relationships and 617 individuals in committed non-monogamous relationships. \n \n The group rated relationship components: satisfaction, commitment, trust, jealousy and passionate love, which is the intense love feeling often described in new relationships. \n \n \n \n Researchers found no differences between monogamous and consensual nonmonogamous participants in terms of satisfaction and passionate love. \n \n Furthermore, levels of jealousy were lower and trust was higher among those engaged in committed non-monogamous relationships. \n \n Another finding differed from people's assumptions that those in non-monogamous relationships do not care about each other enough to be happy in their primary relationship. The study, however, showed that an individual had more satisfaction, trust, commitment and passionate love in their primary mate than in their secondary relationship. \n \n The study did show that people in open relationships generally reported somewhat poorer relational functioning than monogamous individuals. Individuals in open relationships were significantly less satisfied and less committed to their relationship than their monogamous counterparts. \n \n They also reported lower levels of passionate love and fewer jealous cognitions than monogamous people and also scored marginally lower on the index of behavioral jealousy than monogamous individuals. \n \n The findings appear in the current issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science. \n \n ||||| Sex is a big part of most romances, whether a marriage or a more experimental union. A recent survey of Europeans shows that people in the most sexually liberated partnerships aren\u2019t having the best time. Monogamous couples reported that they were the most sexually satisfied of all the groups in a large, representative survey conducted in March 2017. \n \n Among the 1,885 people who said they were in monogamous relationships, 82% reported that they were broadly satisfied with their sex life. That compared to 80% of people in a marriage, civil union or other legal partnership, while 71% of people in open or polyamorous relationships said they were fulfilled. \n \n The survey, conducted by Dalia, a Berlin-based research company, included over 11,000 people from the 28 countries in the European Union aged 14-65, though for the purposes of reporting they then excluded those aged under 18. \n \n The findings echo US research that showed that people with young kids had the most sex of all Americans. People who live together (as couples with children often do) have readier access to sex than those in relationships who don\u2019t live together. The EU survey only found 275 people, or 2.5% of the total, who said they were in open relationships. \n \n Age and gender also affect sex-life satisfaction. Men overall reported a slight increase in satisfaction as age increased, while women\u2019s satisfaction remained stable. For both genders, the highest peak was between the ages of 25 and 30. And though not every country in the EU provided enough respondents to produce a statistically significant finding, some that did showed marked differences. Spain proved to be the most sexually satisfied country with 41% of people saying they were \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with their sex lives, while in Germany that number was 38%. In Poland only 23% said they were \u201dvery satisfied,\u201d compared to 28% in Italy and 29% in both the UK and France. \n \n Opening up a relationship can be about more than sex. Advocates talk (paywall) about the deep trust forged by letting one\u2019s partner have other relationships, and the intellectual stimulation and support gained from multiple romantic connections. But the surveys indicate that multiple partners may well not trump one really great one in the bedroom department.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Feel like monogamy is keeping you from an exciting sex life? Take note: An open relationship, with the potential for more sexual partners, does not necessarily mean you'll be more sexually satisfied. That's according to a survey of more than 11,000 people from 28 European countries, aged 18 to 65. In the survey conducted by German research company Dalia in March, 82% of monogamous couples and 80% of married couples reported that they were sexually satisfied, compared to 71% of couples in an open or polyamorous relationship and fewer than half of singles, reports Quartz. Other than singles who are \"looking,\" those in open relationships were actually the most likely to be unsatisfied sexually. Some 22% said they weren't sexually satisfied, compared to 12% of married participants and 11% of monogamous respondents. Interestingly, a University of Michigan survey of some 2,000 people over 25, published in March, found heterosexuals in open relationships were significantly less satisfied with their relationship overall than those in monogamous relationships, reported Michigan Live. On the flip side, though, those in polyamorous relationships reported having higher levels of trust and lower levels of jealousy than their monogamous counterparts. That left researchers to conclude that there is \"no net benefit of one relationship style over another.\" (Americans appear to be having trouble in the bedroom.)"

According to the sheriff, Marx tossed tear gas grenades, smoke grenades and pepper spray grenades -- something he could do more easily with his gas mask strapped on. \n \n Despite this barrage of weapons, the sheriff's deputy was able to distract Marx, to slow him.

They went to Marx's home in Cumming, a small city about 35 northeast of downtown Atlanta, with every expectation that it was booby trapped. \n \n As Piper said: \"Last time we were at the home, we were suspicious because it had been booby trapped before.\" \n \n Once they finally made their way in and cleared the house, they found homemade explosives, according to a law enforcement source. It wasn't clear whether those were attempted booby traps. \n \n A preliminary investigation found that Marx hadn't been in his Cumming home for about 10 days. Besides that, little is known about him beyond that he began working at the Transportation Security Administration in October 2002, according to a U.S. official, and left either the next year or in 2004. \n \n The sheriff said Friday that he and others weren't ready yet to discuss Marx's motive or his thinking. \n \n That said, Piper said it was evident that Marx \"came prepared to stay a while.\" \n \n \"We don't know who he was coming to the courthouse for, but with the flex ties and the restraining devices he had with him,\" said the sheriff. \"We have to assume that he was there to occupy the courthouse.\" \n \n Who is the student who pounded on the Seattle gunman? \n \n Canada shooting: Suspect yelled 'I'm done' at time of arrest \n \n Navy seals off Virginia military hospital in hunt for stabbing suspect",

Witnesses said Oulson threw a bag of popcorn at Reeves, who then pulled a .380 semiautomatic pistol and fired once. \n \n On Wednesday, her face pale and drawn, Nicole Oulson spoke out for the first time about her husband's death, calling it \"unimaginable.\" \n \n \"In the blink of an eye my whole world just got shattered into a million pieces,\" Oulson, 33, tearfully told the media gathered at a news conference in her attorneys' office. \"Now I'm left trying to pick them up and trying to put them all back together. \n \n \"It's so hard and so unbearable,\" she added before leaving the room. \n \n Reeves, 71, is in jail in Pasco County, charged with second-degree murder. \n \n Attorney Stephen Leal, a member of the law firm hired by Mrs. Oulson, said his client would oppose bail for Reeves, who has a court hearing set for Feb. 5. Leal said it might be tough to argue that Reeves, who spent most of his life in the area, is a flight risk. But it could be successfully argued that he poses a danger to the community. \n \n \"I don't know how anybody could be able to convince a judge \u2026 the community is safe if this man is out,\" he said. \n \n Attorney TJ Grimaldi said Nicole Oulson was surprised that Reeves' attorney said he acted in self-defense. \n \n \"I think she's kind of shocked,\" he said. \"She doesn't understand what he was defending himself over.\" \n \n Grimaldi wouldn't close the door on suing the Alabama-based Cobb theater chain but would not comment further. \n \n \"We're exploring all options, but our main focus right now is to guide her through this difficult time of grief, her own personal injury and the entire circus that is the criminal case,\" he said. \"It's sad when it's gotten to this level that we can't go to a movie theater and feel safe.\" \n \n Florida law allows two years for a wrongful death case to be filed and four years for an injury lawsuit. \n \n Attorney Brandon Scheele, who has defended corporations in injury and death cases, said he thinks the plaintiffs would have a difficult time. The law requires them to prove that the shooting was \"foreseeable and preventable.\" Reeves simply complaining to management about someone texting wouldn't be enough, he said. \n \n \"He'd have to have said he was going to shoot the guy\" if employees didn't take action, Scheele said. \n \n Personal injury attorney Hutch Brock said the substance of Reeves' complaint \u2014 who he talked to and what he said \u2014 would also be critical in determining whether there was negligence by the theater staff. If Reeves, who has been accused of complaining about another patron's texting about a month before the shooting, had a reputation for making threats, \"then I think the movie theater likely had some kind of a higher duty than just to let this guy keep coming back in.\" \n \n He said most personal injury lawyers allow the police to do their jobs before deciding whether to sue. \n \n \"They try to stay out of their way,\" Brock said. \n \n The Oulsons' daughter, Alexis, is too young to be fully aware of what has happened but she \"knows that Daddy's gone,\" Grimaldi said. \n \n Nicole Oulson said Alexis is where her focus is now \"and always will be.\" \n \n The attorneys said a trust fund has been set up to help Oulson's family. In a grass roots movement, businesses have held fundraisers and donated proceeds. In all, more than $20,000 has accumulated. \n \n Grimaldi said Nicole Oulson has been touched by the community's generosity. \"She didn't expect this,\" he said. ||||| Through tears today, Nicole Oulson broke her silence, describing the moment her husband, Chad Oulson, was fatally shot after texting in a Florida movie theater. \n \n \"And just to think that in the blink of an eye, my whole world just got shattered into a million pieces,\" she said during a news conference at her attorney's office. \"And now I'm left trying to pick them all up and putting them back together.\" \n \n The Oulsons were enjoying a rare night out together Jan. 13, after leaving their young daughter, Alexis, with a babysitter. \n \n \"Me and my husband didn't get a date night very often, much less a whole day to spend together, so I was just so excited and looking forward to spending the day with the love of my life,\" Oulson said today. \n \n During previews before the movie \"Lone Survivor\" at a Wesley Chapel, Fla., theater, Chad Oulson sent one last text to the babysitter. That reportedly annoyed Curtis Reeves, a retired police captain, sitting with his wife behind the Oulsons. \n \n RELATED: Woman texter's close encounter with accused movie theater gunman \n \n According to authorities, an argument erupted between the two men. Reeves, 71, went to tell the movie theater managers and when he returned, the argument escalated, according to police. \n \n Chad Oulson threw popcorn at Reeves and Reeves pulled out a .380 semi-automatic handgun and shot him. Nicole Oulson was wounded in the hand when she put it up to protect her husband, according to the sheriff's office. Chad Oulson, 43, died that night. \n \n Reeves was arrested at the theater. \n \n Reeves previously said he \"was in fear of being attacked\" by Chad Oulson so he pulled his gun from his pants pocket and shot the victim, police said. \n \n The sheriff said Reeves' gun jammed after the first and only shot was fired. \n \n Reeves was charged with second-degree murder. He is claiming self-defense. \n \n \"He was struck in the face with an unknown object,\" said Reeves' lawyer Richard Escobar. \"At that point, he has every right to defend himself.\" \n \n Reeves' lawyers say they plan to invoke Florida's controversial \"Stand Your Ground\" law, added to that, under Florida law there are harsher penalties for those who attack people older than 65. \n \n That news was heartbreaking for Nicole Oulson. \n \n \"It's hard and it's so unbearable,\" she said. \"But I want to thank you for all of your thoughts and prayers.\" \n \n Reeves faces up to life in prison if convicted.",

    "input": "A special report by Hal Bernton, Mike Carter, David Heath and James Neff \u00b7 June 23 - July 7, 2002 \n \n \n \n \n \n Chapter 13: \n \n On the Case \n \n A French-speaking FBI agent in Seattle, who knew an Algerian accent when he heard it, was the right man to question Benni Noris. \n \n Learn more about the 1999 WTO riots in Seattle. \n \n Even Humphries, a wiry, high-energy, third-year man, was ready for a breather and a good night's sleep. But seconds into the phone conversation, he was fully alert. \n \n Agent Patrick Gahan, calling from Port Angeles, Wash., across Puget Sound on the Olympic Peninsula, was calling about an arrest Humphries had heard a bit about earlier that evening. U.S. Customs officers had detained a suspicious man coming by ferry from Canada. In his trunk were bags of white powder, mysterious chemicals and homemade timing devices. \n \n The detainee, Benni Noris, seemed to speak only French. Gahan didn't, so he was calling Humphries \u0097 who had learned French as a high-school student in Ontario, Canada \u0097 to help. \n \n Give me a few minutes to get to the office, Humphries told Gahan. When he got downtown, Humphries obtained a copy of the standard Miranda-rights card in French. He called the customs trailer in Port Angeles and spoke to the suspect on a speaker phone. \n \n Humphries read Noris his rights in French. Then he asked, \"Voulez-vous parler de ce qui est arriv\u00e9?\" Do you want to talk about what has occurred? \n \n \"Non monsieur, je ne veux pas en parler.\" No sir, I do not want to talk about it. \n \n That single sentence told Humphries plenty. He asked that Gahan turn off the speaker and get on the line. \n \n What ID does this guy have? Humphries asked. A Canadian passport and baptismal certificate from Montreal, with the name Benni Antoine Noris, came the reply. \n \n \"There is no way this guy is who he says he is,\" Humphries said. \"There's no way he's from Montreal.\" \n \n The agent knew Quebecois French \u0097 and this wasn't it. The accent, he thought, sounded like that of a language instructor he had in the Army \u0097 a man from Algeria. \n \n Humphries, Gahan and customs officials decided to hold the suspect on suspicion of using false identification. They needed to buy time to sort this out. \n \n The next morning, Humphries wrote up his \"302,\" FBI parlance for the form used to detail the events of the night before. He gave it to Bob Houston, who oversees agents on the Seattle counterterrorism desk, expecting Houston to assign the case to a more experienced agent. \n \n \n \n \n \n STEVE RINGMAN / THE SEATTLE TIMES Seattle FBI Agent Fred Humphries' first terrorism case was a big one: Ahmed Ressam. With only three years\u2019 tenure at the bureau, he didn\u2019t expect to be assigned a major international case. \n \n Humphries, 34, grew up in Steilacoom, Wash., went to high school in Canada and joined the U.S. Army. He climbed steadily through the ranks, but as a captain in military intelligence he feared he was on track to be a career pencil pusher. He decided to go back to school, winning a scholarship to the University of Tampa and studying criminology. \n \n He spent a summer during college as an intern with the Sheriff's Office in Sangamon County, Ill., where his stepfather was the chief medical examiner. He met FBI agents working on a missing-persons case, and he was hooked. \n \n Here he was with his own major international case. It was a keen responsibility \u0097 coordinating with federal prosecutors, assigning tasks, conducting interviews and keeping track of evidence. \n \n All this would be especially daunting because the Seattle office was in disarray. It had just been moved into new quarters. Agents hadn't been assigned desks or phones, and their files were stored in boxes. The one working phone line did not accept direct-dial, long-distance calls. Agents were running around with pockets full of quarters, searching for a pay phone that wasn't already tied up. At one point, FBI Director Louis Freeh called the Seattle office for an update but gave up trying to get through. \n \n When Humphries finally found a phone, he contacted the bureau's Hazardous Materials Team in Quantico, Va., and asked for specialists to join him. And he began digging for details on the mysterious Benni Noris. Noris had no criminal history in Canada and had never been to the U.S., according to a review of Canadian and U.S. databases. \n \n The next day, Humphries drove to Port Angeles with two HazMat agents and set up a post at the Port Angeles airport. There, he took a call from an FBI agent based in Ottawa, the Canadian capital. The Ottawa agent had been given a photograph by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service that might match Humphries' mysterious Mr. Noris. \n \n The agent faxed over the photo, saying only: \"If this is your guy, you've got trouble.\" No explanation; no name. \n \n Humphries took the picture to the Clallam County Jail. The suspect looked drawn, with dark rings under his eyes. But Humphries found his resemblance to the photo unmistakable. \n \n The man before him was not Benni Noris. But who was he? \n \n \n \n ||||| By William R. Levesque, Times Staff Writer \n \n Posted: Nov 14, 2012 01:30 PM \n \n TAMPA \u2014 The socialite whose friendship with CIA director David Petraeus touched off a sex scandal that led to his resignation had an ID issued by MacDill Air Force Base allowing her daytime visits to the base whenever she desired. \n \n The ID first issued to Jill Kelley in November 2010 was revoked on Tuesday pending a Pentagon investigation, MacDill officials say. \n \n The ID is one of about 800 issued by MacDill's 6th Air Mobility Wing in a program called Friends of MacDill, which allows select civilians who pass a background check to visit MacDill without being accompanied by someone with a military ID. \n \n The wing serves as something akin to a landlord for other commands at the base, including U.S. Central Command. Petraeus was CentCom's chief from 2008 to 2010. The wing is in charge of base security, and its armed personnel stand watch at MacDill's entry gates. \n \n The program was launched in late 2010 by Col. Lenny Richoux, former wing commander who now serves in Europe. \n \n Kelley obtained the ID four months after Petraeus left CentCom in June 2010 to take command of U.S. troops in Afghanistan. His deputy commander, Marine Gen. John Allen, served as CentCom's acting chief for six weeks after Petraeus' departure. \n \n Kelley's pass was renewed in February 2012. \n \n Allen is himself ensnared in the controversy surrounding Kelley and Petraeus. The Pentagon is investigating emails between Allen and Kelley that may have been inappropriate, according to published reports. \n \n In a recent interview with the Tampa Bay Times, the wing's current commander, Col. Scott DeThomas, described Friends of MacDill as a successful program allowing civilians to visit MacDill's two golf courses, eat at one of several restaurants or go bowling, among other activities. \n \n DeThomas said ID holders \"tend to be very active on base.\" \n \n Richoux told the Times last year that one of the rationales for the program, aside from forging beneficial ties to the community, is to help generate revenue for MacDill's recreational outlets. \n \n \"Some people have told me they've lived their whole lives in Tampa and never set foot on the base,\" Richoux said last year. \"They always wondered about what happens here. So I said, 'Well, come on down and see. This is federal property. This belongs to you.' \" \n \n The program was by invitation only, and Richoux said he had invited Tampa Bay area business and civic leaders. \n \n Pass holders are fingerprinted and undergo a background check. Some high-security areas of MacDill are off limits and visits are limited to daylight hours. \n \n Timm Sweeney, who runs an international marketing and research firm in Tampa, told the Times last year that the program builds goodwill for the base in Tampa. \n \n \"MacDill has a very good vetting process,\" he said. \"It's not like they're just inviting any crazy on the base.\" \n \n Richoux said Friends of MacDill was approved by Air Force officials, and he said that he also sought the approval and advice of officials at CentCom and U.S. Special Operations Command, which also is located at MacDill. \n \n MacDill declined to release the names of the people on the access list. \n \n William R.

Petraeus as C.I.A. director is a \u201chard-charging\u201d veteran who helped investigate the foiled millennium terrorist plot in 1999, colleagues said on Wednesday. \n \n The agent, Frederick W. Humphries II, 47, is also described by former colleagues as relentless in his pursuit of what he sees as wrongdoing, which appears to describe his role in the F.B.I. investigation involving Mr. Petraeus. Suspecting that the case involved serious security issues and was being stalled, possibly for political reasons \u2014 a suspicion his superiors say was unjustified \u2014 he took his concerns to Congressional Republicans. \n \n \u201cFred is a passionate kind of guy,\u201d one former colleague said. \u201cHe\u2019s kind of an obsessive type. If he locked his teeth onto something, he\u2019d be a bulldog.\u201d \n \n The question of how and why the F.B.I. opened the investigation that has had such momentous consequences has been central from the moment Mr. Petraeus stepped down Friday. The emerging portrait of the agent who initiated the inquiry is another step toward an answer. \n \n Mr. Humphries, who was identified on Wednesday by law enforcement colleagues, took the initial complaint from Jill Kelley, a Tampa woman active in local military circles and a personal friend, about anonymous e-mails that accused her of inappropriately flirtatious behavior toward Mr. Petraeus. \n \n The subsequent cyberstalking investigation uncovered an extramarital affair between Mr. Petraeus and Paula Broadwell, his biographer, who agents determined had sent the anonymous e-mails. It also ensnared Gen. John R. Allen, the commander of NATO forces in Afghanistan, after F.B.I. agents discovered what a law enforcement official said on Wednesday were sexually explicit e-mail exchanges between him and Ms. Kelley. \n \n A spokesman for Ms. Kelley provided her version of events in two conference calls with reporters on Wednesday. Ms. Kelley\u2019s concern when she took the e-mails to Mr. Humphries was that she feared the sender was \u201cstalking\u201d Mr. Petraeus and General Allen, said the spokesman, who asked not to be identified. \n \n \u201cShe asks the agent, \u2018What do you make of this?\u2019 \u201d the spokesman said. \u201cThe agent said: \u2018This is serious. They seem to know the comings and goings of a couple of generals.\u2019 \u201d \n \n General Allen himself had received a similar anonymous e-mail message, sent by someone identified as \u201ckelleypatrol,\u201d advising him to stay away from Ms. Kelley. The general forwarded it to Ms. Kelley, and they discussed a concern that someone was cyberstalking them. \n \n On Tuesday, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta said he had asked the Senate to postpone a confirmation hearing for General Allen\u2019s next assignment while the department\u2019s inspector general reviewed his e-mail correspondence with Ms. Kelley, which was discovered by F.B.I. agents investigating her initial complaint. \n \n Pentagon officials said the review covered more than 10,000 pages of documents that included \u201cinappropriate\u201d messages. But associates of General Allen have said that the two exchanged about a dozen e-mails a week since meeting two years ago and that his messages were affectionate but platonic. \n \n A law enforcement official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, disputed that assertion on Wednesday, saying some messages were clearly sexual. Investigators were confident \u201cthe nature of the content warranted passing them on\u201d to the inspector general, the official said. \n \n In a statement on Wednesday, General Allen\u2019s military counsel said he intended to cooperate fully with the inspector general\u2019s investigation. \u201cTo the extent there are questions about certain communications by General Allen, he shares in the desire to resolve those questions as completely and quickly as possible,\u201d said the statement from Col. John G. Baker, the chief defense counsel of the Marine Corps.",

It was presented at a press conference in the Vatican on Thursday, by Cardinal Kurt Koch, Fr Norbert Hofmann of the Vatican Commission, together with two Jewish representatives, Rabbi David Rosen, International Director of Interreligious Affairs for the American Jewish Committee, and Dr Ed Kessler, founding director of the Cambridge Woolf Institute. \n \n Please find below the full text of the document \"The Gifts and Calling of God are irrevocable\" \n \n COMMISSION FOR RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH THE JEWS \n \n \u201cTHE GIFTS AND THE CALLING OF GOD ARE IRREVOCABLE\u201d (Rom 11:29) \n \n A REFLECTION ON THEOLOGICAL QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO CATHOLIC-JEWISH RELATIONS ON THE OCCASION OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF \u201cNOSTRA AETATE\u201d (NO.4) \n \n INDEX \n \n A brief history of the impact of \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No.4) over the last 50 years \n \n The special theological status of Jewish-Catholic dialogue \n \n Revelation in history as \u2018Word of God\u2019 in Judaism and Christianity \n \n The relationship between the Old and New Testament and the Old and New Covenant \n \n 5.

Its fourth article presents the relationship between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people in a new theological framework. The following reflections aim at looking back with gratitude on all that has been achieved over the last decades in the Jewish-Catholic relationship, providing at the same time a new stimulus for the future. Stressing once again the unique status of this relationship within the wider ambit of interreligious dialogue, theological questions are further discussed, such as the relevance of revelation, the relationship between the Old and the New Covenant, the relationship between the universality of salvation in Jesus Christ and the affirmation that the covenant of God with Israel has never been revoked, and the Church\u2019s mandate to evangelize in relation to Judaism. This document presents Catholic reflections on these questions, placing them in a theological context, in order that their significance may be deepened for members of both faith traditions. The text is not a magisterial document or doctrinal teaching of the Catholic Church, but is a reflection prepared by the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews on current theological questions that have developed since the Second Vatican Council. It is intended to be a starting point for further theological thought with a view to enriching and intensifying the theological dimension of Jewish-Catholic dialogue. \n \n 1. A brief history of the impact of \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No.4) over the last 50 years \n \n \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No.4) is rightly counted among those documents of the Second Vatican Council which have been able to effect, in a particularly striking manner, a new direction of the Catholic Church since then. This shift in the relations of the Church with the Jewish people and Judaism becomes apparent only when we recall that there were previously great reservations on both sides, in part because the history of Christianity has been seen to be discriminatory against Jews, even including attempts at forced conversion (cf. \u201cEvangelii gaudium\u201d, 248). The background of this complex connection consists inter alia in an asymmetrical relationship: as a minority the Jews were often confronted by and dependent upon a Christian majority. The dark and terrible shadow of the Shoah over Europe during the Nazi period led the Church to reflect anew on her bond with the Jewish people. \n \n The fundamental esteem for Judaism expressed in \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No.4) however has enabled communities that once faced one another with scepticism to become - step by step over the years - reliable partners and even good friends, capable of weathering crises together and negotiating conflicts positively. Therefore, the fourth article of \u201cNostra aetate\u201d is recognised as the solid foundation for improving the relationship between Catholics and Jews. \n \n For the practical implementation of \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No.4), Blessed Pope Paul VI on 22 October 1974 established the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews which, although organisationally attached to the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, is operationally independent and entrusted with the task of accompanying and fostering religious dialogue with Judaism. From a theological perspective it also makes good sense to link this Commission with the Council for Promoting Christian Unity, since the separation between Synagogue and Church may be viewed as the first and most far-reaching breach among the chosen people. \n \n Within a year of its foundation, the Holy See\u2019s Commission published its first official document on 1 December 1974, with the title \u201cGuidelines and Suggestions for Implementing the Conciliar Declaration Nostra Aetate (No.4)\u201d. The crucial and new concern of this document consists in becoming acquainted with Judaism as it defines itself, giving expression to the high esteem in which Christianity holds Judaism and stressing the great significance for the Catholic Church of dialogue with the Jews, as stated in the words of the document: \u201cOn the practical level in particular, Christians must therefore strive to acquire a better knowledge of the basic components of the religious tradition of Judaism: they must strive to learn by what essential traits the Jews define themselves in the light of their own religious experience\u201d (Preamble). On the basis of the Church\u2019s witness of faith in Jesus Christ, the document reflects upon the specific nature of the Church\u2019s dialogue with Judaism. Reference is made in the text to the roots of Christian liturgy in its Jewish matrix, new possibilities are outlined for rapprochement in the spheres of teaching, education and training, and finally suggestions are made for joint social action. \n \n Eleven years later on 24 June 1985, the Holy See\u2019s Commission issued a second document entitled \u201cNotes on the correct way to present the Jews and Judaism in preaching and catechesis in the Roman Catholic Church\u201d. This document has a stronger theolo gical- exegetical orientation insofar as it reflects on the relationship of the Old and New Testaments, delineates the Jewish roots of the Christian faith, explicates the manner in which \u2018the Jews\u2019 are represented in the New Testament, points out commonalities in liturgy, above all in the great festivals of the church year, and briefly focuses on the relationship of Judaism and Christianity in history. With regard to the \u201cland of the forefathers\u201d the document emphasizes: \u201cChristians are invited to understand this religious attachment which finds its roots in Biblical tradition, without however making their own any particular religious interpretation of this relationship. ... The existence of the State of Israel and its political options should be envisaged not in a perspective which is in itself religious, but in their reference to the common principles of international law.\u201d The permanence of Israel is however to be perceived as an \u201chistoric fact and a sign to be interpreted within God\u2019s design\u201d (VI, 1). \n \n A third document of the Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews was presented to the public on 16 March 1998. It deals with the Shoah under the title \u201cWe remember. A reflection on the Shoah\u201d. This text delivers the harsh but accurate judgement that the balance of the 2000-year relationship between Jews and Christians is regrettably negative. It recalls the attitude of Christians towards the anti-Semitism of the National Socialists and focuses on the duty of Christians to remember the human catastrophe of the Shoah. In a letter at the beginning of this declaration Saint Pope John Paul II expresses his hope that this document will truly \u201chelp to heal the wounds of past misunderstandings and injustices. May it enable memory to play its necessary part in the process of shaping a future in which the unspeakable iniquity of the Shoah will never again be possible.\u201d \n \n In the series of documents issued by the Holy See, reference must be made to the text published by the Pontifical Biblical Commission on 24 May 2001, which deals explicitly with Jewish-Catholic dialogue: \u201cThe Jewish People and their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible\u201d. This represents the most significant exegetical and theological document of the Jewish-Catholic dialogue and is a treasure-trove of common issues which have their basis in the Scriptures of Judaism and Christianity. The Sacred Scriptures of the Jewish people are considered a \u201cfundamental component of the Christian Bible\u201d, the fundamental themes of the Holy Scripture of the Jewish people and their adoption into the faith in Christ are discussed, and the manner in which Jews are represented in the New Testament is illustrated in detail. \n \n Texts and documents, as important as they are, cannot replace personal encounters and face-to-face dialogues. While under Blessed Pope Paul VI the first steps in Jewish- Catholic dialogue were undertaken, Saint Pope John Paul II succeeded in fostering and deepening this dialogue through compelling gestures towards the Jewish people. He was the first pope to visit the former concentration camp of Auschwitz-Birkenau to pray for the victims of the Shoah, and he visited the Roman Synagogue to express his solidarity with the Jewish community. In the context of an historical pilgrimage to the Holy Land, he was also a guest of the state of Israel where he participated in interreligious encounters, paid a visit to both Chief Rabbis and prayed at the Western Wall. Again and again he met with Jewish groups, whether in the Vatican or during his numerous apostolic journeys. So too Benedict XVI, even before his election to the papacy, engaged in Jewish-Catholic dialogue by offering in a series of lectures important theological reflections on the relationship between the Old and the New Covenant, and the Synagogue and the Church. Following his election and in the footsteps of Saint Pope John Paul II he fostered this dialogue in his own way by reinforcing the same gestures and giving expression to his esteem for Judaism through the power of his words. As Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio was greatly committed to fostering Jewish-Catholic dialogue and had many friends among the Jews of Argentina. Now as Pope he continues, at the international level, to intensify dialogue with Judaism through many friendly encounters. One of his first such encounters was in May 2014 in Israel, where he met with the two Chief Rabbis, visited the Western Wall, and prayed for the victims of the Shoah in Yad Vashem. \n \n Even before the establishment of the Holy See\u2019s Commission, there were contacts and links with various Jewish organisations through the then Secretariat for Promoting Christian Unity. Since Judaism is multi-facetted and not constituted as an organisational unity, the Catholic Church was faced with the challenge of determining with whom to engage, because it was not possible to conduct individual and independent bilateral dialogues with all Jewish groupings and organisations which had declared their readiness to dialogue. To resolve this problem the Jewish organisations took up the suggestion of the Catholic Church to establish a single organisation for this dialogue. The International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC) is the official Jewish representative to the Holy See\u2019s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews. \n \n The IJCIC began its work in 1970, and a year later the first joint conference was organized in Paris. The conferences which have been conducted regularly since are the responsibility of the entity known as the International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee (ILC), and they shape the collaboration between the IJCIC and the Holy See\u2019s Commission. In February 2011, once more in Paris, the ILC was able to look back with gratitude on 40 years of institutional dialogue. Much has developed over the past 40 years; the former confrontation has turned into successful cooperation, the previous potential for conflict has become positive conflict management, and the past co-existence marked by tension has been replaced by resilient and fruitful mutuality. The bonds of friendship forged in the meantime have proved to be stable, so that it has become possible to address even controversial subjects together without the danger of permanent damage being done to the dialogue. This was all the more necessary because over the past decades the dialogue had not always been free of tensions. In general, however, one can observe with appreciation that in Jewish-Catholic dialogue since the new millennium above all, intensive efforts have been made to deal openly and positively with any arising differences of opinion and conflicts, in such a way that mutual relations have become stronger. \n \n Beside the dialogue with the IJCIC we should also mention the institutional conversation with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel, which is clearly to be seen as a fruit of the encounter of Saint Pope John Paul II with both Chief Rabbis in Jerusalem during his visit to Israel in March 2000. The first meeting was organised in June 2002 in Jerusalem, and since then such meetings have been conducted annually, taking place in Rome and Jerusalem alternately. The two delegations are relatively small so that a very personal and intensive discussion on various subjects is possible, such as on the sanctity of life, the status of the family, the significance of the Sacred Scriptures for life in society, religious freedom, the ethical foundations of human behaviour, the ecological challenge, the relationship of secular and religious authority and the essential qualities of religious leadership in secular society. The fact that the Catholic representatives taking part in the meetings are bishops and priests and the Jewish representatives almost exclusively rabbis permits individual topics to be examined from a religious perspective as well. The dialogue with the Chief Rabbinate of Israel has to that extent enabled more open relations between Orthodox Judaism and the Catholic Church at a global level. After each meeting a joint declaration is published which in each instance has testified to the richness of the common spiritual heritage of Judaism and Christianity and to what valuable treasures are still to be unearthed. In reviewing over more than ten years of dialogue we can gratefully affirm that a strong friendship has resulted which represents a firm foundation for the future. \n \n The efforts of the Holy See\u2019s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews cannot of course be restricted to these two institutional dialogues. The Commission aims in fact at being open to all streams within Judaism and at maintaining contact with all Jewish groupings and organisations that wish to establish links with the Holy See. The Jewish side shows a particular interest in audiences with the Pope, which are in every instance prepared by the Commission. Besides direct contacts with Judaism the Holy See\u2019s Commission also strives to provide opportunities within the Catholic Church for dialogue with Judaism and to work together with individual Bishops\u2019 Conferences to support them locally in promoting Jewish-Catholic dialogue. The introduction of the \u2018Day of Judaism\u2019 in some European countries is a good example of this. \n \n Over the past decades both the \u2018dialogue ad extra\u2019 and the \u2018dialogue ad intra\u2019 have led with increasing clarity to the awareness that Christians and Jews are irrevocably inter\u00addependent, and that the dialogue between the two is not a matter of choice but of duty as far as theology is concerned. Jews and Christians can enrich one another in mutual friendship. Without her Jewish roots the Church would be in danger of losing its soteriological anchoring in salvation history and would slide into an ultimately unhistorical Gnosis. Pope Francis states that \u201cwhile it is true that certain Christian beliefs are unacceptable to Judaism, and that the Church cannot refrain from proclaiming Jesus as Lord and Messiah, there exists as well a rich complementarity which allows us to read the texts of the Hebrew Scriptures together and to help one another to mine the riches of God\u2019s word. We can also share many ethical convictions and a common concern for justice and the development of peoples\u201d (\u201cEvangelii gaudium\u201d, 249). \n \n The special theological status of Jewish-Catholic dialogue \n \n The dialogue with Judaism is for Christians something quite special, since Christianity possesses Jewish roots which determine relations between the two in a unique way (cf. \u201cEvangelii gaudium\u201d, 247). In spite of the historical breach and the painful conflicts arising from it, the Church remains conscious of its enduring continuity with Israel. Judaism is not to be considered simply as another religion; the Jews are instead our \u201celder brothers\u201d (Saint Pope John Paul II), our \u201cfathers in faith\u201d (Benedict XVI). Jesus was a Jew, was at home in the Jewish tradition of his time, and was decisively shaped by this religious milieu (cf. \u201cEcclesia in Medio Oriente\u201d, 20). His first disciples gathered around him had the same heritage and were defined by the same Jewish tradition in their everyday life. In his unique relationship with his heavenly Father, Jesus was intent above all on proclaiming the coming of the Kingdom of God. \u201cThe time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand, repent and believe in the gospel\u201d (Mk 1:15). Within Judaism there were many very different kinds of ideas regarding how the kingdom of God would be realised, and yet Jesus\u2019 central message on the Kingdom of God is in accordance with some Jewish thinking of his day. One cannot understand Jesus\u2019 teaching or that of his disciples without situating it within the Jewish horizon in the context of the living tradition of Israel; one would understand his teachings even less so if they were seen in opposition to this tradition. In Jesus not a few Jews of his time saw the coming of a \u2018new Moses\u2019, the promised Christ (Messiah). But his coming nevertheless provoked a drama with consequences still felt today. Fully and completely human, a Jew of his time, descendant of Abraham, son of David, shaped by the whole tradition of Israel, heir of the prophets, Jesus stands in continuity with his people and its history. On the other hand he is, in the light of the Christian faith, himself God - the Son - and he transcends time, history, and every earthly reality. The community of those who believe in him confesses his divinity (cf. Phil 2:6-11). In this sense he is perceived to be in discontinuity with the history that prepared his coming. From the perspective of the Christian faith, he fulfils the mission and expectation of Israel in a perfect way. At the same time, however, he overcomes and transcends them in an eschatological manner. Herein consists the fundamental difference between Judaism and Christianity, that is, how the figure of Jesus is to be evaluated. Jews are able to see Jesus as belonging to their people, a Jewish teacher who felt himself called in a particular way to preach the Kingdom of God. That this Kingdom of God has come with himself as God\u2019s representative is beyond the horizon of Jewish expectation. The conflict between Jesus and the Jewish authorities of his time is ultimately not a matter of an individual transgression of the law, but of Jesus\u2019 claim to be acting with divine authority. The figure of Jesus thus is and remains for Jews the \u2018stumbling block\u2019, the central and neuralgic point in Jewish-Catholic dialogue. From a theological perspective, Christians need to refer to the Judaism of Jesus\u2019 time and to a degree also the Judaism that developed from it over the ages for their own self-understanding. Given Jesus\u2019 Jewish origins, coming to terms with Judaism in one way or another is indispensable for Christians. Yet, the history of the relationship between Judaism and Christianity has also been mutually influenced over time. \n \n Dialogue between Jews and Christians then can only be termed \u2018interreligious dialogue\u2019 by analogy, that is, dialogue between two intrinsically separate and different religions. It is not the case that two fundamentally diverse religions confront one another after having developed independently of one another or without mutual influence. The soil that nurtured both Jews and Christians is the Judaism of Jesus\u2019 time, which not only brought forth Christianity but also, after the destruction of the temple in the year 70, post-biblical rabbinical Judaism which then had to do without the sacrificial cult and, in its further development, had to depend exclusively on prayer and the interpretation of both written and oral divine revelation. Thus Jews and Christians have the same mother and can be seen, as it were, as two siblings who - as is the normal course of events for siblings - have developed in different directions. The Scriptures of ancient Israel constitute an integral part of the Scriptures of both Judaism and Christianity, understood by both as the word of God, revelation, and salvation history. The first Christians were Jews; as a matter of course they gathered as part of the community in the Synagogue, they observed the dietary laws, the Sabbath and the requirement of circumcision, while at the same time confessing Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah sent by God for the salvation of Israel and the entire human race. With Paul the \u2018Jewish Jesus movement\u2019 definitively opens up other horizons and transcends its purely Jewish origins. Gradually his concept came to prevail, that is, that a non-Jew did not have to become first a Jew in order to confess Christ. In the early years of the Church, therefore, there were the so-called Jewish Christians and the Gentile Christians, the ecclesia ex circumcisione and the ecclesia ex gentibus, one Church originating from Judaism, the other from the Gentiles, who however together constituted the one and only Church of Jesus Christ. \n \n The separation of the Church from the Synagogue does not take place abruptly however and, according to some recent insights, may not have been complete until well into the third or fourth centuries. This means that many Jewish Christians of the first period did not perceive any contradiction between living in accordance with some aspects of the Jewish tradition and yet confessing Jesus as the Christ. Only when the number of Gentile Christians represented the majority, and within the Jewish community the polemics regarding the figure of Jesus took on sharper contours, did a definitive separation appear to be no longer avoidable. Over time the siblings Christianity and Judaism increasingly grew apart, becoming hostile and even defaming one another. For Christians, Jews were often represented as damned by God and blind since they were unable to recognise in Jesus the Messiah and bearer of salvation. For Jews, Christians were often seen as heretics who no longer followed the path originally laid down by God but who went their own way. It is not without reason that in the Acts of the Apostles Christianity is called \u2018the way\u2019 (cf. Acts 9:2; 19:9,23; 24:14,22) in contrast to the Jewish Halacha which determined the interpretation of the law for practical conduct. Over time Judaism and Christianity became increasingly alienated from one another, even becoming involved in ruthless conflicts and accusing one another of abandoning the path prescribed by God. \n \n On the part of many of the Church Fathers the so-called replacement theory or supersessionism steadily gained favour until in the Middle Ages it represented the standard theological foundation of the relationship with Judaism: the promises and commitments of God would no longer apply to Israel because it had not recognised Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God, but had been transferred to the Church of Jesus Christ which was now the true \u2018new Israel\u2019, the new chosen people of God. Arising from the same soil, Judaism and Christianity in the centuries after their separation became involved in a theological antagonism which was only to be defused at the Second Vatican Council. With its Declaration \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No.4) the Church unequivocally professes, within a new theological framework, the Jewish roots of Christianity. While affirming salvation through an explicit or even implicit faith in Christ, the Church does not question the continued love of God for the chosen people of Israel. A replacement or supersession theology which sets against one another two separate entities, a Church of the Gentiles and the rejected Synagogue whose place it takes, is deprived of its foundations. From an originally close relationship between Judaism and Christianity a long-term state of tension had developed, which has been gradually transformed after the Second Vatican Council into a constructive dialogue relationship. \n \n There have often been attempts to identify this replacement theory in the Epistle to the Hebrews. This Epistle, however, is not directed to the Jews but rather to the Christians of Jewish background who have become weary and uncertain. Its purpose is to strengthen their faith and to encourage them to persevere, by pointing to Christ Jesus as the true and ultimate high priest, the mediator of the new covenant. This context is necessary to understand the Epistle\u2019s contrast between the first purely earthly covenant and a second better (cf. Heb 8:7) and new covenant (cf. 9:15, 12:24). The first covenant is defined as outdated, in decline and doomed to obsolescence (cf. 8:13), while the second covenant is defined as everlasting (cf. 13:20). To establish the foundations of this contrast the Epistle refers to the promise of a new covenant in the Book of the Prophet Jeremiah 31:31-34 (cf. Heb 8:8-12). This demonstrates that the Epistle to the Hebrews has no intention of proving the promises of the Old Covenant to be false, but on the contrary treats them as valid. The reference to the Old Testament promises is intended to help Christians to be sure of their salvation in Christ. At issue in the Epistle to the Hebrews is not the contrast of the Old and New Covenants as we understand them today, nor a contrast between the church and Judaism. Rather, the contrast is between the eternal heavenly priesthood of Christ and the transitory earthly priesthood. The fundamental issue in the Epistle to the Hebrews in the new situation is a Christological interpretation of the New Covenant. For exactly this reason, \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No.4) did not refer to the Epistle to the Hebrews, but rather to Saint Paul\u2019s reflections in his letter to the Romans 9-11. \n \n For an outside observer, the Conciliar Declaration \u201cNostra aetate\u201d could give the impression that the text deals with the relations of the Catholic Church with all world religions in a relationship based on parity, but the history of its development and the text itself point in a different direction. Originally Saint Pope John XXIII proposed that the Council should promulgate a Tractatus de Iudaeis, but in the end the decision was made to give consideration to all world religions in \u201cNostra aetate\u201d. However, the fourth article of this Conciliar Declaration, which deals with a new theological relationship with Judaism, represents almost the heart of the document, in which a place is also made for the Catholic \n \n Church\u2019s relationship with other religions. The relationship with Judaism can in that sense be seen as the catalyst for the determination of the relationship with the other world religions. \n \n Nevertheless, from the theological perspective the dialogue with Judaism has a completely different character and is on a different level in comparison with the other world religions. The faith of the Jews testified to in the Bible, found in the Old Testament, is not for Christians another religion but the foundation of their own faith, although clearly the figure of Jesus is the sole key for the Christian interpretation of the Scriptures of the Old Testament. The cornerstone of the Christian faith is Jesus (cf. Acts 4:11; 1 Pt 2:4-8). However, the dialogue with Judaism occupies a unique position for Christians; Christianity is by its roots connected with Judaism as with no other religion. Therefore the Jewish-Christian dialogue can only with reservations be termed \u2018interreligious dialogue\u2019 in the true sense of the expression; one could however speak of a kind of \u2018intra-religious\u2019 or \u2018intra-familial\u2019 dialogue sui generis. In his address in the Roman Synagogue on 13 April 1986 Saint Pope John Paul II expressed this situation in these words: \u201cThe Jewish religion is not \u2018extrinsic\u2019 to us but in a certain way is \u2018intrinsic\u2019 to our own religion. With Judaism therefore we have a relationship which we do not have with any other religion. You are our dearly beloved brothers and, in a certain way, it could be said that you are our elder brothers.\u201d \n \n Revelation in history as \u2018Word of God\u2019 in Judaism and Christianity \n \n We find in the Old Testament God\u2019s plan of salvation presented for his people (cf. \u201cDei verbum\u201d, 14). This plan of salvation is expressed in an enlightening way at the beginning of biblical history in the call to Abraham (Gen 12ff). In order to reveal himself and speak to humankind, redeeming it from sin and gathering it together as one people, God began by choosing the people of Israel through Abraham and setting them apart. To them God revealed himself gradually through his emissaries, his prophets, as the true God, the only God, the living God, the redeeming God. This divine election was constitutive of the people of Israel. Only after the first great intervention of the redeeming God, the liberation from slavery in Egypt (cf. Ex 13:17ff) and the establishment of the covenant at Sinai (Ex 19ff), did the twelve tribes truly become a nation and become conscious of being the people of God, the bearers of his message and his promises, witnesses of his merciful favour in the midst of the nations and also for the nations (cf. Is 26:1-9; 54; 60; 62). In order to instruct his people on how to fulfil their mission and how to pass on the revelation entrusted to them, God gave Israel the law which defines how they are to live (cf. Ex 20; Deut 5), and which distinguishes them from other peoples. \n \n Like the Church itself even in our own day, Israel bears the treasure of its election in fragile vessels. The relationship of Israel with its Lord is the story of its faithfulness and its unfaithfulness. In order to fulfil his work of salvation despite the smallness and weakness of the instruments he chose, God manifested his mercy and the graciousness of his gifts, as well as his faithfulness to his promises which no human infidelity can nullify (cf. Rom 3:3; 2 Tim 2:13). At every step of his people along the way God set apart at least a \u2018small number\u2019 (cf. Deut 4:27), a \u2018remnant\u2019 (cf. Is 1:9; Zeph 3:12; cf. also Is 6:13; 17:5-6), a handful of the faithful who \u2018have not bowed the knee to Baal\u2019 (cf. 1 Kings 19:18). Through this remnant, God realized his plan of salvation. Constantly the object of his election and love remained the chosen people as through them - as the ultimate goal - the whole of humanity is gathered together and led to him. \n \n The Church is called the new people of God (cf. \u201cNostra aetate\u201d, No.4) but not in the sense that the people of God of Israel has ceased to exist. The Church \u201cwas prepared in a remarkable way throughout the history of the people of Israel and by means of the Old Covenant\u201d (\u201cLumen gentium\u201d, 2). The Church does not replace the people of God of Israel, since as the community founded on Christ it represents in him the fulfilment of the promises made to Israel. This does not mean that Israel, not having achieved such a fulfilment, can no longer be considered to be the people of God. \u201cAlthough the Church is the new people of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures\u201d (\u201cNostra aetate\u201d, No.4). \n \n God revealed himself in his Word, so that it may be understood by humanity in actual historical situations. This Word invites all people to respond. If their responses are in accord with the Word of God they stand in right relationship with him. For Jews this Word can be learned through the Torah and the traditions based on it. The Torah is the instruction for a successful life in right relationship with God. Whoever observes the Torah has life in its fullness (cf. Pirqe Avot II, 7). By observing the Torah the Jew receives a share in communion with God. In this regard, Pope Francis has stated: \u201cThe Christian confessions find their unity in Christ; Judaism finds its unity in the Torah. Christians believe that Jesus Christ is the Word of God made flesh in the world; for Jews the Word of God is present above all in the Torah. Both faith traditions find their foundation in the One God, the God of the Covenant, who reveals himself through his Word. In seeking a right attitude towards God, Christians turn to Christ as the fount of new life, and Jews to the teaching of the Torah.\u201d (Address to me mbers of the International Council of Christians and Jews, 30 June 2015). \n \n Judaism and the Christian faith as seen in the New Testament are two ways by which God\u2019s people can make the Sacred Scriptures of Israel their own. The Scriptures which Christians call the Old Testament is open therefore to both ways. A response to God\u2019s word of salvation that accords with one or the other tradition can thus open up access to God, even if it is left up to his counsel of salvation to determine in what way he may intend to save mankind in each instance. That his will for salvation is universally directed is testified by the Scriptures (cf. eg. Gen 12:1-3; Is 2:2-5; 1 Tim 2:4). Therefore there are not two paths to salvation according to the expression \u201cJews hold to the Torah, Christians hold to Christ\u201d. Christian faith proclaims that Christ\u2019s work of salvation is universal and involves all mankind. God\u2019s word is one single and undivided reality which takes concrete form in each respective historical context. \n \n In this sense, Christians affirm that Jesus Christ can be considered as \u2018the living Torah of God\u2019. Torah and Christ are the Word of God, his revelation for us human beings as testimony of his boundless love. For Christians, the pre-existence of Christ as the Word and Son of the Father is a fundamental doctrine, and according to rabbinical tradition the Torah and the name of the Messiah exist already before creation (cf. Genesis Rabbah 1,1). Further, according to Jewish understanding God himself interprets the Torah in the Eschaton, while in Christian understanding everything is recapitulated in Christ in the end (cf. Eph 1:10; Col 1:20). In the gospel of Matthew Christ is seen as it were as the \u2018new Moses\u2019. Matthew 5:17-19 presents Jesus as the authoritative and authentic interpreter of the Torah (cf. Lk 24:27, 45-47). In the rabbinical literature, however, we find the identification of the Torah with Moses. Against this background, Christ as the \u2018new Moses\u2019 can be connected with the Torah. Torah and Christ are the locus of the presence of God in the world as this presence is experienced in the respective worship communities. The Hebrew dabar means word and event at the same time - and thus one may reach the conclusion that the word of the Torah may be open for the Christ event. \n \n 4. The relationship between the Old and New Testament and the Old and New Covenant \n \n The covenant that God has offered Israel is irrevocable. \u201cGod is not man, that he should lie\u201d (Num 23:19; cf. 2 Tim 2:13). The permanent elective fidelity of God expressed in earlier covenants is never repudiated (cf. Rom 9:4; 11:1-2). The New Covenant does not revoke the earlier covenants, but it brings them to fulfilment. Through the Christ event Christians have understood that all that had gone before was to be interpreted anew. For Christians the New Covenant has acquired a quality of its own, even though the orientation for both consists in a unique relationship with God (cf. for example, the covenant formula in Lev 26:12, \u201cI will be your God and you will be my people\u201d). For Christians, the New Covenant in Christ is the culminating point of the promises of salvation of the Old Covenant, and is to that extent never independent of it. The New Covenant is grounded in and based on the Old, because it is ultimately the God of Israel who concludes the Old Covenant with his people Israel and enables the New Covenant in Jesus Christ. Jesus lives during the period of the Old Covenant, but in his work of salvation in the New Covenant confirms and perfects the dimensions of the Old. The term covenant, therefore, means a relationship with God that takes effect in different ways for Jews and Christians. The New Covenant can never replace the Old but presupposes it and gives it a new dimension of meaning, by reinforcing the personal nature of God as revealed in the Old Covenant and establishing it as openness for all who respond faithfully from all the nations (cf. Zech 8:20-23; Psalm 87). \n \n Unity and difference between Judaism and Christianity come to the fore in the first instance with the testimonies of divine revelation. With the existence of the Old Testament as an integral part of the one Christian Bible, there is a deeply rooted sense of intrinsic kinship between Judaism and Christianity. The roots of Christianity lie in the Old Testament, and Christianity constantly draws nourishment from these roots. However, Christianity is grounded in the person of Jesus of Nazareth, who is recognised as the Messiah promised to the Jewish people, and as the only begotten Son of God who has communicated himself through the Holy Spirit following his death on the cross and his resurrection. With the existence of the New Testament, the question naturally arose quite soon of how the two testaments are related to one another, whether for example the New Testament writings have not superseded the older writings and nullified them. This position was represented by Marcion, who in the second century held that the New Testament had made the Old Testament book of promises obsolete, destined to fade away in the glow of the new, just as one no longer needs the light of the moon as soon as the sun has risen. This stark antithesis between the Hebrew and the Christian Bible never became an official doctrine of the Christian Church. By excluding Marcion from the Christian community in 144, the Church rejected his concept of a purely \u201cChristian\u201d Bible purged of all Old Testament elements, bore witness to its faith in the one and only God who is the author of both testaments, and thus held fast to the unity of both testaments, the \u201cconcordia testamentorum\u201d. \n \n This is of course only one side of the relationship between the two testaments. The common patrimony of the Old Testament not only formed the fundamental basis of a spiritual kinship between Jews and Christians but also brought with it a basic tension in the relationship of the two faith communities. This is demonstrated by the fact that Christians read the Old Testament in the light of the New, in the conviction expressed by Augustine in the indelible formula: \u201cIn the Old Testament the New is concealed and in the New the Old is revealed\u201d (Quaestiones in Heptateuchum 2, 73). Pope Gregory the Great also spoke in the same sense when he defined the Old Testament as \u201cthe prophecy of the New\u201d and the latter as the \u201cbest exposition of the Old\u201d (Homiliae in Ezechielem I, VI, 15; cf. \u201cDei verbum\u201d, 16). \n \n This Christological exegesis can easily give rise to the impression that Christians consider the New Testament not only as the fulfilment of the Old but at the same time as a replacement for it. That this impression cannot be correct is evident already from the fact that Judaism too found itself compelled to adopt a new reading of Scripture after the catastrophe of the destruction of the Second Temple in the year 70. Since the Sadducees who were bound to the temple did not survive this catastrophe, the rabbis, following in the footsteps of the Pharisees, who had already developed their particular mode of reading and interpreting Scripture, now did so without the temple as the centre of Jewish religious devotion. \n \n As a consequence there were two responses to this situation, or more precisely, two new ways of reading Scripture, namely the Christological exegesis of the Christians and the rabbinical exegesis of that form of Judaism that developed historically. Since each mode involved a new interpretation of Scripture, the crucial new question must be precisely how these two modes are related to each other. But since the Christian Church and post-biblical rabbinical Judaism developed in parallel, but also in opposition and mutual ignorance, this question cannot be answered from the New Testament alone. After centuries of opposing positions it has been the duty of Jewish-Catholic dialogue to bring these two new ways of reading the Biblical writings into dialogue with one another in order to perceive the \u201crich complementarity\u201d where it exists and \u201cto help one another to mine the riches of God\u2019s word\u201d (\u201cEvangelii gaudium\u201d, 249). The document of the Pontifical Biblical Commission \u201cThe Jewish People and Their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible\u201d in 2001 therefore stated that Christians can and must admit \u201cthat the Jewish reading of the Bib le is a possible one, in continuity with the Jewish Scriptures from the Second Temple period, a reading analogous to the Christian reading which developed in parallel fashion\u201d. It then draws the conclusion: \u201cBoth readings are bound up with the vision of their respective faiths, of which the readings are the result and expression. Consequently, both are irreducible\u201d (No.22). \n \n Since each of the two readings serves the purpose of rightly understanding God\u2019s will and word, it becomes evident how important is the awareness that the Christian faith is rooted in the faith of Abraham. That raises the further question of how the Old and the New Covenant stand in relation to one another. For the Christian faith it is axiomatic that there can only be one single covenant history of God with humanity. The covenant with Abraham, with circumcision as its sign (cf. Gen 17), and the covenant with Moses restricted to Israel regarding obedience to the law (cf. Ex 19:5; 24:7-8) and in particular the observance of the Sabbath (cf. Ex 31:16-17) had been extended in the covenant with Noah, with the rainbow as its sign (cf. \u201cVerbum Domini\u201d, 117), to the whole of creation (cf. Gen 9:9 ff). Through the prophets God in turn promises a new and eternal covenant (cf. Is 55:3; 61:8; Jer 31:31-34; Ez 36:22-28). Each of these covenants incorporates the previous covenant and interprets it in a new way. That is also true for the New Covenant which for Christians is the final eternal covenant and therefore the definitive interpretation of what was promised by the prophets of the Old Covenant, or as Paul expresses it, the \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cAmen\u201d to \u201call that God has promised\u201d (2 Cor 1:20). The Church as the renewed people of God has been elected by God without conditions. The Church is the definitive and unsurpassable locus of the salvific action of God. This however does not mean that Israel as the people of God has been repudiated or has lost its mission (cf. \u201cNostra aetate\u201d, No.4). The New Covenant for Christians is therefore neither the annulment nor the replacement, but the fulfilment of the promises of the Old Covenant. \n \n For Jewish-Christian dialogue in the first instance God\u2019s covenant with Abraham proves to be constitutive, as he is not only the father of Israel but also the father of the faith of Christians. In this covenant community it should be evident for Christians that the covenant that God concluded with Israel has never been revoked but remains valid on the basis of God\u2019s unfailing faithfulness to his people, and consequently the New Covenant which Christians believe in can only be understood as the affirmation and fulfilment of the Old. Christians are therefore also convinced that through the New Covenant the Abrahamic covenant has obtained that universality for all peoples which was originally intended in the call of Abram (cf. Gen 12:1-3). This recourse to the Abrahamic covenant is so essentially constitutive of the Christian faith that the Church without Israel would be in danger of losing its locus in the history of salvation. By the same token, Jews could with regard to the Abrahamic covenant arrive at the insight that Israel without the Church would be in danger of remaining too particularist and of failing to grasp the universality of its experience of God. In this fundamental sense Israel and the Church remain bound to each other according to the covenant and are interdependent. \n \n That there can only be one history of God\u2019s covenant with mankind, and that consequently Israel is God\u2019s chosen and beloved people of the covenant which has never been repealed or revoked (cf. Rom 9:4; 11:29), is the conviction behind the Apostle Paul\u2019s passionate struggle with the dual fact that while the Old Covenant from God continues to be in force, Israel has not adopted the New Covenant. In order to do justice to both facts Paul coined the expressive image of the root of Israel into which the wild branches of the Gentiles have been grafted (cf. Rom 11:16-21). One could say that Jesus Christ bears in himself the living root of the \u201cgreen olive tree\u201d, and yet in a deeper meaning that the whole promise has its root in him (cf. Jn 8:58). This image represents for Paul the decisive key to thinking of the relationship between Israel and the Church in the light of faith. With this image Paul gives expression to the duality of the unity and divergence of Israel and the Church. On the one hand the image is to be taken seriously in the sense that the grafted wild branches have not their origin as branches in the plant onto which they are grafted and their new situation represents a new reality and a new dimension of God\u2019s work of salvation, so that the Christian Church cannot merely be understood as a branch or a fruit of Israel (cf. Mt 8:10\u00ad13). On the other hand, the image is also to be taken seriously in the sense that the Church draws nourishment and strength from the root of Israel, and that the grafted branches would wither or even die if they were cut off from the root of Israel (cf. \u201cEcclesia in Medio Oriente\u201d, 21). \n \n 5. The universality of salvation in Jesus Christ and God\u2019s unrevoked covenant with Israel \n \n Since God has never revoked his covenant with his people Israel, there cannot be different paths or approaches to God\u2019s salvation. The theory that there may be two different paths to salvation, the Jewish path without Christ and the path with the Christ, whom Christians believe is Jesus of Nazareth, would in fact endanger the foundations of Christian faith. Confessing the universal and therefore also exclusive mediation of salvation through Jesus Christ belongs to the core of Christian faith. So too does the confession of the one God, the God of Israel, who through his revelation in Jesus Christ has become totally manifest as the God of all peoples, insofar as in him the promise has been fulfilled that all peoples will pray to the God of Israel as the one God (cf. Is 56:1-8). The document \u201cNotes on the correct way to present the Jews and Judaism in preaching and catechesis in the Roman Catholic Church\u201d published by the Holy See\u2019s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews in 1985 therefore maintained that the Church and Judaism cannot be represented as \u201ctwo parallel ways to salvation\u201d, but that the Church must \u201cwitness to Christ as the Redeemer for all\u201d (No.I, 7). The Christian faith confesses that God wants to lead all people to salvation, that \n \n Jesus Christ is the universal mediator of salvation, and that there is no \u201cother name under heaven given to the human race by which we are to be saved\u201d (Acts 4:12). \n \n From the Christian confession that there can be only one path to salvation, however, it does not in any way follow that the Jews are excluded from God\u2019s salvation because they do not believe in Jesus Christ as the Messiah of Israel and the Son of God. Such a claim would find no support in the soteriological understanding of Saint Paul, who in the Letter to the Romans not only gives expression to his conviction that there can be no breach in the history of salvation, but that salvation comes from the Jews (cf. also Jn 4:22). God entrusted Israel with a unique mission, and He does not bring his mysterious plan of salvation for all peoples (cf. 1 Tim 2:4) to fulfilment without drawing into it his \u201cfirst-born son\u201d (Ex 4:22). From this it is self-evident that Paul in the Letter to the Romans definitively negates the question he himself has posed, whether God has repudiated his own people. Just as decisively he asserts: \u201cFor the gifts and the call of God are irrevocable\u201d (Rom 11:29). That the Jews are participants in God\u2019s salvation is theologically unquestionable, but how that can be possible without confessing Christ explicitly, is and remains an unfathomable divine mystery. It is therefore no accident that Paul\u2019s soteriological reflections in Romans 9-11 on the irrevocable redemption of Israel against the background of the Christ-mystery culminate in a magnificent doxology: \u201cOh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How inscrutable are his judgments and how unsearchable his ways\u201d (Rom 11:33). Bernard of Clairvaux (De cons. III/1,3) says that for the Jews \u201ca determined point in time has been fixed which cannot be anticipated\u201d. \n \n Another focus for Catholics must continue to be the highly complex theological question of how Christian belief in the universal salvific significance of Jesus Christ can be combined in a coherent way with the equally clear statement of faith in the never-revoked covenant of God with Israel. It is the belief of the Church that Christ is the Saviour for all. There cannot be two ways of salvation, therefore, since Christ is also the Redeemer of the Jews in addition to the Gentiles. Here we confront the mystery of God\u2019s work, which is not a matter of missionary efforts to convert Jews, but rather the expectation that the Lord will bring about the hour when we will all be united, \u201cwhen all peoples will call on God with one voice and \u2018serve him shoulder to shoulder\u2019 \u201d (\u201cNostra aetate\u201d, No.4). \n \n The Declaration of the Second Vatican Council on Judaism, that is the fourth article of \u201cNostra aetate\u201d, is located within a decidedly theological framework regarding the universality of salvation in Jesus Christ and God\u2019s unrevoked covenant with Israel. That does not mean that all theological questions which arise in the relationship of Christianity and Judaism were resolved in the text. These questions were introduced in the Declaration, but require further theological reflection. Of course, there had been earlier magisterial texts which focussed on Judaism, but \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No.4) provides the first theological overview of the relationship of the Catholic Church to the Jews. \n \n Because it was such a theological breakthrough, the Conciliar text is not infrequently over-interpreted, and things are read into it which it does not in fact contain. An important example of over-interpretation would be the following: that the covenant that God made with his people Israel perdures and is never invalidated. Although this statement is true, it cannot be explicitly read into \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No.4). This statement was instead first made with full clarity by Saint Pope John Paul II when he said during a meeting with Jewish representatives in Mainz on 17 November 1980 that the Old Covenant had never bee n revoked by God: \u201cThe first dimension of this dialogue, that is, the meeting between the people of God of the Old Covenant, never revoked by God ... and that of the New Covenant, is at the same time a dialogue within our Church, that is to say, between the first and the second part of her Bible\u201d (No.3). The same conviction is stated also in t he Catechism of the Church in 1993: \u201cThe Old Covenant has never been revoked\u201d (121). \n \n The Church\u2019s mandate to evangelize in relation to Judaism \n \n It is easy to understand that the so-called \u2018mission to the Jews\u2019 is a very delicate and sensitive matter for Jews because, in their eyes, it involves the very existence of the Jewish people. This question also proves to be awkward for Christians, because for them the universal salvific significance of Jesus Christ and consequently the universal mission of the Church are of fundamental importance. The Church is therefore obliged to view evangelisation to Jews, who believe in the one God, in a different manner from that to people of other religions and world views. In concrete terms this means that the Catholic Church neither conducts nor supports any specific institutional mission work directed towards Jews. While there is a principled rejection of an institutional Jewish mission, Christians are nonetheless called to bear witness to their faith in Jesus Christ also to Jews, although they should do so in a humble and sensitive manner, acknowledging that Jews are bearers of God\u2019s Word, and particularly in view of the great tragedy of the Shoah. \n \n The concept of mission must be presented correctly in dialogue between Jews and Christians. Christian mission has its origin in the sending of Jesus by the Father. He gives his disciples a share in this call in relation to God\u2019s people of Israel (cf. Mt 10:6) and then as the risen Lord with regard to all nations (cf. Mt 28:19). Thus the people of God attains a new dimension through Jesus, who calls his Church from both Jews and Gentiles (cf. Eph 2:11\u00ad22) on the basis of faith in Christ and by means of baptism, through which there is incorporation into his Body which is the Church (\u201cLumen gentium\u201d, 14). \n \n Christian mission and witness, in personal life and in proclamation, belong together. The principle that Jesus gives his disciples when he sends them out is to suffer violence rather than to inflict violence. Christians must put their trust in God, who will carry out his universal plan of salvation in ways that only he knows, for they are witnesses to Christ, but they do not themselves have to implement the salvation of humankind. Zeal for the \u201chouse of the Lord\u201d and confident trust in the victorious deeds of God belong together. Christian mission means that all Christians, in community with the Church, confess and proclaim the historical realisation of God\u2019s universal will for salvation in Christ Jesus (cf. \u201cAd gentes\u201d, 7). They experience his sacramental presence in the liturgy and make it tangible in their service to others, especially those in need. \n \n It is and remains a qualitative definition of the Church of the New Covenant that it consists of Jews and Gentiles, even if the quantitative proportions of Jewish and Gentile Christians may initially give a different impression. Just as after the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ there were not two unrelated covenants, so too the people of the covenant of Israel are not disconnected from \u2018the people of God drawn from the Gentiles\u2019. Rather, the enduring role of the covenant people of Israel in God\u2019s plan of salvation is to relate dynamically to the \u2018people of God of Jews and Gentiles, united in Christ\u2019, he whom the Church confesses as the universal mediator of creation and salvation. In the context of God\u2019s universal will of salvation, all people who have not yet received the gospel are aligned with the people of God of the New Covenant. \u201cIn the first place there is the people to whom the covenants and promises were given and from whom Christ was born according to the flesh (cf. Rom 9:4-5). On account of their fathers this people remains most dear to God, for he does not repent of the gifts he makes nor of the calls he issues (cf. Rom 11:28-29)\u201d (\u201cLumen gentium\u201d, 16). \n \n The goals of dialogue with Judaism \n \n The first goal of the dialogue is to add depth to the reciprocal knowledge of Jews and Christians. One can only learn to love what one has gradually come to know, and one can only know truly and profoundly what one loves. This profound knowledge is accompanied by a mutual enrichment whereby the dialogue partners become the recipients of gifts. The Conciliar declaration \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No. 4) speaks of the rich spiritual patrimony that should be further discovered step by step through biblical and theological studies and through dialogue. To that extent, from the Christian perspective, an important goal is the mining of the spiritual treasures concealed in Judaism for Christians. In this regard one must mention above all the interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures. In the foreword by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger to the 2001 document of the Pontifical Biblical Commission \u201cThe Jewish People and their Sacred Scriptures in the Christian Bible\u201d, the respect of Christians for the Jewish interpretation of the Old Testament is stressed. It highlights that \u201cChristians can learn a great deal from a Jewish exegesis practised for more than 2000 years; in return Christians may hope that Jews can profit from Christian exegetical research.\u201d In the field of exegesis many Jewish and Christian scholars now work together and find their collaboration mutually fruitful precisely because they belong to different religious traditions. \n \n This reciprocal acquiring of knowledge must not be limited to specialists alone. Therefore it is important that Catholic educational institutions, particularly in the training of priests, integrate into their curricula both \u201cNostra aetate\u201d and the subsequent documents of the Holy See regarding the implementation of the Conciliar declaration. The Church is also grateful for the analogous efforts within the Jewish community. The fundamental changes in relations between Christians and Jews which were initiated by \u201cNostra aetate\u201d (No. 4) must also be made known to the coming generations and be received and disseminated by them. \n \n One important goal of Jewish-Christian dialogue certainly consists in joint engagement throughout the world for justice, peace, conservation of creation, and reconciliation. In the past, it may have been that the different religions - against the background of a narrowly understood claim to truth and a corresponding intolerance - contributed to the incitement of conflict and confrontation. But today religions should not be part of the problem, but part of the solution. Only when religions engage in a successful dialogue with one another, and in that way contribute towards world peace, can this be realised also on the social and political levels. Religious freedom guaranteed by civil authority is the prerequisite for such dialogue and peace. In this regard, the litmus-test is how religious minorities are treated, and which rights of theirs are guaranteed. In Jewish-Christian dialogue the situation of Christian communities in the state of Israel is of great relevance, since there - as nowhere else in the world - a Christian minority faces a Jewish majority. Peace in the Holy Land - lacking and constantly prayed for - plays a major role in dialogue between Jews and Christians. \n \n Another important goal of Jewish-Catholic dialogue consists in jointly combatting all manifestations of racial discrimination against Jews and all forms of anti-Semitism, which have certainly not yet been eradicated and re-emerge in different ways in various contexts. History teaches us where even the slightest perceptible forms of anti-Semitism can lead: the human tragedy of the Shoah in which two-thirds of European Jewry were annihilated. Both faith traditions are called to maintain together an unceasing vigilance and sensitivity in the social sphere as well. Because of the strong bond of friendship between Jews and Catholics, the Catholic Church feels particularly obliged to do all that is possible with our Jewish friends to repel anti-Semitic tendencies. Pope Francis has repeatedly stressed that a Christian can never be an anti-Semite, especially because of the Jewish roots of Christianity. \n \n Justice and peace, however, should not simply be abstractions within dialogue, but should also be evidenced in tangible ways. The social-charitable sphere provides a rich field of activity, since both Jewish and Christian ethics include the imperative to support the poor, disadvantaged and sick. Thus, for example, the Holy See\u2019s Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews and the International Jewish Committee on Interreligious Consultations (IJCIC) worked together in 2004 in Argentina during the financial crisis in that country to organise joint soup kitchens for the poor and homeless, and to enable impoverished children to attend school by providing meals for them. Most Christian churches have large charitable organisations, which likewise exist within Judaism. These would be able to work together to alleviate human need. Judaism teaches that the commandment \u201cto walk in His ways\u201d (Deut 11:22) requires the imitation of the Divine Attributes (Imitatio Dei) through care for the vulnerable, the poor and the suffering (Babylonian Talmud, Sotah 14a). This principle accords with Jesus\u2019 instruction to support those in need (cf. eg. Mt 25:35-46). Jews and Christians cannot simply accept poverty and human suffering; rather they must strive to overcome these problems. \n \n When Jews and Christians make a joint contribution through concrete humanitarian aid for justice and peace in the world, they bear witness to the loving care of God. No longer in confrontational opposition but cooperating side by side, Jews and Christians should seek to strive for a better world. Saint Pope John Paul II called for such cooperation in his address to the Central Council of German Jewry and to the Conference of Rabbis in Mainz on 17 November 1980: \u201cJews and Christians, as children of Abraham, are called to be a blessing for the world ... , by committing themselves together for peace and justice among all men and peoples, with the fullness and depth that God himself intended us to have, and with the readiness for sacrifices that this goal may demand\u201d. \n \n 10 December 2015 \n \n Cardinal Kurt Koch President \n \n The Most Reverend Brian Farrell Vice-President \n \n The Reverend Norbert Hofmann, SDB Secretary ||||| COMMISSION OF THE HOLY SEE FOR \n \n RELIGIOUS RELATIONS WITH THE JEWS \n \n Nostra Aetate n. 4 \n \n Introduction \n \n [Italian] \n \n Nostra Aetate n. 4 \n \n [English, French, German, Italian, Latin, Portuguese, Spanish] \n \n Commission for Religious Relations with the Jews \n \n CRRJ \n \n Introduction \n \n [Italian] \n \n Documents of the Commission \n \n \u201cThe Gifts and the Calling of God are Irrevocable\u201d (Rom 11:29) -

It says Jesus can only be understood in the Jewish context of his time. \"The document was drafted by the Vatican Commission for Religious Relations With Jews; the commission was created following the release half a century ago of the groundbreaking document called Nostra Aetate \u2014 'In Our Times.' \"That document repudiated the idea of collective Jewish guilt for Jesus' death. \"The new document says that from a detached coexistence, Catholics and Jews have arrived at a deep friendship. And it says Catholics must refrain from active attempts to convert Jews.\" \n \n The Vatican commission includes the work of Cardinal Kurt Koch and the Rev. Norbert Hofmann. They presented the results of their work Thursday alongside Edward Kessler, founder of the Woolf Institute in Cambridge, U.K., and Rabbi David Rosen, the American Jewish Committee's International Director of Interreligious Affairs. \n \n While it seeks to deal with hundreds of years of history, the Vatican document also quotes the current pope: \n \n \"Pope Francis states that 'while it is true that certain Christian beliefs are unacceptable to Judaism, and that the Church cannot refrain from proclaiming Jesus as Lord and Messiah, there exists as well a rich complementarity which allows us to read the texts of the Hebrew Scriptures together and to help one another to mine the riches of God's word. We can also share many ethical convictions and a common concern for justice and the development of peoples' ('Evangelii gaudium,' 249).\" \n \n Discussing the document today, Rosen said, \"the very fact that we can talk about complementarity is itself a powerful demonstration of how far we have come along this remarkable journey of transformation and reconciliation between Catholics and Jews over the last half century.\" \n \n The commission's document also cites Francis' immediate predecessors: ||||| VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Catholics should not try to convert Jews and should work with them to fight anti-Semitism, the Vatican said on Thursday in a major document drawing the Church further away from the strained relations of the past. \n \n Cardinal Kurt Koch (R) and Rabbi David Rosen attend a news conference to present a major new document, that drew the Church further away from the strained relations of the past with Judaism, at the Vatican December 10, 2015. REUTERS/Tony Gentile \n \n It was the latest move on a host of issues, such as gay rights and re-marriage, that the Vatican or Pope Francis have made showing a desire to be more compassionate and open and to move further away from entrenched traditions. \n \n In the past, for example, Catholic prayers have denounced Jews for not believing in Jesus. Jews have also accused the World War Two papacy of turning a blind eye to the Holocaust, a charge the Vatican denies. \n \n The new document from the Vatican\u2019s Commission for Religious Relations with Jews stressed recent Vatican teachings that the two religions were intertwined and that God had never annulled his covenant with the Jewish people. \n \n \u201cThe Church is therefore obliged to view evangelization (spreading Christianity) to Jews, who believe in the one God, in a different manner from that to people of other religions and world views,\u201d it said. \n \n It also said Catholics should be particularly sensitive about the significance to Jews of the Shoah, the Hebrew word for the Holocaust, and pledged \u201cto do all that is possible with our Jewish friends to repel anti-Semitic tendencies\u201d. \n \n \u201cA Christian can never be an anti-Semite, especially because of the Jewish roots of Christianity,\u201d it said. \n \n The document coincided with the 50th anniversary of a Vatican repudiation of the concept of collective Jewish guilt for Jesus\u2019 death and the launch of a theological dialogue that traditionalists have rejected. \n \n They believe there should be a so-called \u201cJewish mission\u201d to convert Jews because they did not accept Jesus as the Messiah. Such traditionalists were therefore bound to be displeased by the document\u2019s words on conversion, a senior Vatican official said. \n \n \u201cIn concrete terms this means that the Catholic Church neither conducts nor supports any specific institutional mission work directed towards Jews,\u201d said the document, adding that there was a \u201cprincipled rejection of an institutional Jewish mission\u201d. \n \n \u201cThis is the first formal document that makes it clear there is no intentional desire to actively proselytize amongst Jews,\u201d Rabbi David Rosen, international director of inter-religious affairs for the American Jewish Committee, told Reuters. \n \n Rosen, who is based in Jerusalem, has been a key figure in formal theological dialogue with the Vatican for decades. \n \n CATHOLIC PRAYER ONCE CALLED JEWS \u201cPERFIDIOUS\u201d \n \n Edward Kessler, director of the Woolf Institute for the study of inter-religious relations in Cambridge, said much education of the young had to be done to dispel the notion that Christianity had \u201creplaced and substituted\u201d Judaism. \n \n Kessler, who is Jewish, told a Vatican news conference that both sides had to \u201censure the transformation in relations is not limited to the elite, but extends from the citadels of the Vatican to the pews of the Church as well as from the offices of the chief rabbis to the floors of our synagogues.\u201d \n \n Until about 1960, prayers at Catholic Masses on Good Friday, the day commemorating the death of Jesus, labeled Jews \u201cperfidious\u201d and called for their conversion. \n \n Slideshow (4 Images) \n \n That prayer was eliminated from general use after the 1962-1965 Second Vatican Council introduced a new missal, or prayer book used at Masses. \n \n But later a prayer for the Jews was allowed to remain in the old-style Latin Mass, sometimes called the Tridentine Rite, used by ultra-traditionalists such as the Society of Saint Pius X, whose members reject the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. \n \n In 2008, then-Pope Benedict further reformulated the prayer used by the traditionalists to remove language that Jewish groups found offensive, such as \u201cthe blindness of that people\u201d.",
    "reference": "\u2013 The Vatican is taking steps toward fixing its long-troubled history with the Jewish faith with the Thursday release of a 10,000-word document that instructs Catholics to help Jews fight anti-Semitism instead of trying to convert them, Reuters reports. The Commission for Religious Relations With the Jews explained that Catholicism and Judaism shared the same origins and that \"the Church is therefore obliged to view evangelization ... to Jews \u2026 in a different manner from that to people of other religions and world views.\" The document continues that \"while affirming salvation through an explicit or even implicit faith in Christ, the Church does not question the continued love of God for the chosen people of Israel,\" NPR notes. The report also broaches the Holocaust, noting Catholics should be more sensitive to perceptions that the Vatican looked the other way, as well as help combat anti-Semitism. \"A Christian can never be an anti-Semite, especially because of the Jewish roots of Christianity,\" it reads. The new mandate falls in line with Pope Francis' other progressive policies, including steps on homosexuality and divorce. The Jewish director of Cambridge's Woolf Institute, which conducts interfaith research, emphasized that Catholic youth shouldn't be taught Christianity had \"replaced and substituted\" Judaism, Reuters notes. Both sides need to \"ensure the transformation in relations is not limited to the elite, but extends from the citadels of the Vatican to the pews of the Church, as well as from the offices of the chief rabbis to the floors of our synagogues,\" he adds. (Francis had big things to say about fossil fuel emissions on Thanksgiving Day.)"

Emma Stone, the actress the director chose to portray her, is not. The casting decision raised eyebrows and drew criticism from groups who said that by using Stone to play a character who explicitly states her racially mixed background throughout the movie, Crowe was whitewashing the role. Now Crowe, in a post on his own site, has offered a \"heart-felt apology to all who felt this was an odd or misguided casting choice.\" \n \n The director says that he was \"grateful for the dialogue\" the backlash provided, but also took the time to defend his decision to cast Stone as Ng. \"As far back as 2007,\" Crowe writes, \"Captain Allison Ng was written to be a super-proud one-quarter Hawaiian who was frustrated that, by all outward appearances, she looked nothing like one.\" Crowe, who has described Aloha as a film about Hawaii, says that her half-Chinese father was meant to symbolize \"the surprising mix of cultures often prevalent\" on the islands. \n \n The director says Ng was based on a real-life, red-haired Hawaiian local \n \n Crowe says that Ng was written to be \"extremely proud of her unlikely heritage,\" and also \"personally compelled to over-explain every chance she gets.\" The character, he says, was based on a \"real-life, red-headed local\" who also detailed her background to others whenever possible. Certainly, the movie makes a point of conflating Ng's stated heritage with her outward appearances \u2014 Bradley Cooper's character makes direct reference to her self-definition as Hawaiian, in the same way Americans will define themselves as one-eighth Irish, Italian, or similar. \n \n But despite his protestations, the director does not discount the complaints about the casting choice entirely. \"I have learned something very inspiring,\" Crowe writes. \"So many of us are hungry for stories with more racial diversity, more truth in representation, and I am anxious to help tell those stories in the future.\" Hopefully, after the turgid Aloha, the director's apparently new-found cultural sensitivity will also remind him how to make good movies again.",

Saying he was just there to drop something off, he went to her classroom where Smith was, along with two classroom aides and 15 special needs students. \n \n Anderson took just a few steps into Classroom B1, and, without saying a word, pulled out a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum revolver and fired 10 shots, reloading midway through, authorities said. Smith was killed immediately. Two boys, Jonathan Martinez, 8, and a 9-year-old fellow student, who has not been identified, were struck near her. \n \n Jonathan Martinez \n \n Jonathan was born with Williams syndrome, a genetic condition that affects about 1 in 10,000 people worldwide, including an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people in the United States. The syndrome causes cardiovascular disease, developmental delays and learning delays, according to the Williams Syndrome Association. \n \n \u201cChildren with Williams syndrome tend to be social, friendly and endearing,\u201d Marsden said. \n \n A GoFundMe account is raising money to pay for the funeral and other expenses for Jonathan\u2019s family. \n \n By Tuesday evening, it had raised more than $65,000. \n \n \u201cWe honestly can\u2019t thank everyone enough,\u201d Jonathan\u2019s cousin, Brianna Lopez, wrote. \u201cWe appreciate everyone\u2019s sweet words, and we are very speechless. Thank you (for) coming together. We will keep everyone updated on any further news. My family truly truly appreciates everything from the bottom of our hearts.\u201d \n \n Kate Cichy, who handles regional communications for GoFundMe, said a verification team is working with Lopez to ensure that the funds go to Jonathan\u2019s parents. \n \n Cedric Anderson \n \n After shooting Smith and the two boys, Anderson killed himself. \n \n Anderson had been arrested twice in Torrance, police records show. \n \n He and Smith married on Jan. 28, but had separated. Neither of the cases in Torrance involved Smith. \n \n By mid-March, Smith had moved out of their Riverside home amidst allegations of infidelity and was living with family, including her adult children. (All of her children have been checked on and are fine, according to police.) \n \n \u201cIt appears that he had been attempting to contact her and get her to move back home,\u201d Burguan said. \n \n According to Smith family members interviewed by police, Anderson had made threats \u2014 although not that he intended to shoot her \u2014 but she didn\u2019t view them as serious and just thought he was looking for attention. Smith apparently did not tell anyone but her closest family members about his odd behavior and the problems she and Anderson were experiencing. \n \n \u201cShe effectively kept her private life private,\u201d Burguan said. \n \n During their search of the Riverside home on Monday, investigators found a note from Anderson about needing closure and feeling disrespected. But nothing about it suggested it was necessarily a suicide note. \n \n \u201cIf found outside of the context of this case, I\u2019m not sure anyone would be terribly alarmed,\u201d Burguan said. \n \n Neighbors at the Mount Wasatch Drive house said they saw police detain a man whom Burguan identified Tuesday as Anderson\u2019s brother. He was interviewed but not arrested, Burguan said. \n \n A computer and phone taken from the residence will be examined, authorities said. \n \n Unlike the phone of Dec. 2, 2015, shooter Syed Rizwan Farook, which was hacked only when the FBI hired a company to override the encryption, police do not expect to have difficulty obtaining information from Anderson\u2019s and Smith\u2019s phones, Burguan said. \n \n Police are now looking at a personal computer and cellphones obtained during their investigation. \n \n Surveillance video at North Park shows Anderson attempted to get in through locked external doors before going through the main office, as school security requires. There, since staff knew him, they sent him to Classroom B1 and Smith. \n \n \u201cThere was no indication to anyone (on) staff that he was a threat,\u201d Marsden said. \u201cThe staff knew this newlywed couple but had no information about the crisis they were in.\u201d \n \n Anderson was arrested four times between 1982 and 2013, according to Burguan, including for nongun weapons charges, domestic violence and theft, but never convicted. It is not yet known if the domestic violence charge involved Smith. An unemployed maintenance worker, Anderson was reportedly trying to start his own business. \n \n The Smith & Wesson revolver Anderson used Monday was purchased in Michigan in 1979 by someone other than him. It\u2019s not yet clear how Anderson got the gun, Burguan said. \n \n Not uncommon for spouses to visit \n \n Marsden said all district policies were complied with when Anderson was let onto campus. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s not uncommon for spouses to visit. There does not appear to be a breakdown of security,\u201d Burguan said. \u201cThere will be a full and complete review, but it appears that things worked as they were supposed to, beyond this being a regrettable tragedy.\u201d \n \n North Park Elementary will be closed until Monday. All other district schools will remain open. \n \n The district will do a complete review of its school visitation policies and procedures, according to a news release sent Tuesday afternoon. \n \n Domestic violence \n \n Twitter posts using the hashtag #KarenSmith began to pop up accompanied by messages about domestic violence. \n \n \u201cA woman is shot and killed by her partner every 16 hours. Domestic abusers should not have access to firearms. #KarenSmith,\u201d read a post from user Erin Aura. \n \n Another man, identifying himself as Renee Graham, pointed out that if Anderson had killed Smith in their home instead of a classroom, the attack wouldn\u2019t be national news. He then urged people to \u201c(s)top ignoring domestic violence.\u201d \n \n Because of the attack, Assemblywoman Eloise G\u00f3mez Reyes and Option House Inc. will hold a news conference today at Option House in San Bernardino to discuss domestic violence and the importance of speaking out when it occurs. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s imperative that we do everything possible to call out domestic violence when it happens and to be there for the victims and connect them with services so they can begin the healing process,\u201d said Reyes, a member of the Assembly Select Committee on Domestic Violence. \n \n The gun-control group Everytown for Gun Safety released a study Tuesday showing that between 2009 and 2016 in the U.S. there were 156 mass shootings, resulting in 848 fatalities. The group defines a mass shooting as an event in which at least four people, not including the shooter, are killed by a gun. \n \n Of those shootings, 54 percent involved domestic or family violence, according to Everytown. \n \n Staff writers Beatriz Valenzuela, Brian Rokos and Larry Altman contributed to this report. ||||| The video shown here explains Williams syndrome and can be shared to help others understand Williams syndrome.

It is characterized by medical problems, including cardiovascular disease, developmental delays, and learning challenges. These often occur side by side with striking verbal abilities, highly social personalities and an affinity for music. \n \n Williams syndrome is caused by the spontaneous deletion of 26-28 genes on chromosome #7. The deletion occurs in either the egg or the sperm used to form the child with Williams syndrome. Accordingly, the deletion is present at the time of conception. It is likely that the elastin gene deletion accounts for many of the physical features of Williams syndrome. Some medical and developmental problems are probably caused by deletions of additional genetic material near the elastin gene on chromosome #7. The extent of these deletions may vary among individuals. In most families, the child with Williams syndrome is the only one to have the condition in his or her entire extended family. However, the individual with Williams syndrome has a 50% chance of passing the disorder on to each of his or her children. \n \n WS affects 1 in 10,000 people worldwide \u2013 an estimated 20,000 to 30,000 people in the United States. It is known to occur equally in both males and females and in every culture. \n \n Children with Williams syndrome tend to be social, friendly and endearing. Parents often say the joy and perspective a child with WS brings into their lives had been unimaginable. \n \n But there are major struggles as well. Many babies have life-threatening cardiovascular problems. Children with WS need costly and ongoing medical care and early interventions (such as speech or occupational therapy) that may not be covered by insurance or state funding. As they grow, they struggle with things like spatial relations, numbers, and abstract reasoning, which can make daily tasks a challenge. As adults, most people with Williams syndrome will need supportive housing to live to their fullest potential. Many adults with WS contribute to their communities as volunteers or paid employees; often working at assisted living homes for senior citizens, hospitals and libraries, or as store greeters or veterinary aides. \n \n Just as important are opportunities for social interaction. As people with Williams syndrome mature \u2013 beyond the structure of school and family activities \u2013 they often experience intense isolation which can lead to depression. They are extremely sociable and experience the normal need to connect with others; however people with Williams syndrome often don\u2019t process nuanced social cues and this makes it difficult to form lasting relationships. \n \n There are many physical features and medical challenges which are fairly common to Williams syndrome. However, every child is an individual - the number of features present, and which features are present varies from child to child. \n \n Common features of Williams syndrome include: \n \n Characteristic facial appearance \n \n Most young children with Williams syndrome are described as having similar facial features. These features include a small upturned nose, long philtrum (upper lip length), wide mouth, full lips, small chin, and puffiness around the eyes. Blue and green-eyed children with Williams syndrome can have a prominent \"starburst\" or white lacy pattern on their iris. Facial features become more apparent with age. \n \n Heart and blood vessel problems \n \n The majority of individuals with Williams syndrome have some type of heart or blood vessel problem. Typically, there is narrowing in the aorta producing supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), or narrowing in the pulmonary arteries. There is a broad range in the degree of narrowing, ranging from trivial to severe (requiring surgical correction of the defect). Since there is an increased risk for development of blood vessel narrowing or high blood pressure over time, periodic monitoring of cardiac status is necessary. \n \n Hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels) \n \n Some young children with Williams syndrome have elevations in their blood calcium level. The true frequency and cause of this problem is unknown. When hypercalcemia is present, it can cause extreme irritability or \"colic-like\" symptoms. Occasionally, dietary or medical treatment is needed. In most cases, the problem resolves on its own during childhood, but lifelong abnormality in calcium or Vitamin D metabolism may exist and should be monitored. \n \n Low birth-weight / slow weight gain \n \n Most children with Williams syndrome have a slightly lower birth-weight than their brothers or sisters. Slow weight gain, especially during the first several years of life, is also a common problem and many children are diagnosed as \"failure to thrive\". Adult stature is smaller than average \n \n Feeding difficulty (generally limited to the early years) \n \n Many infants and young children have feeding problems. These problems have been linked to low muscle tone, severe gag reflex, poor suck/swallow, tactile defensiveness etc. Feeding difficulties tend to resolve as the children get older. \n \n Irritability (colic during infancy) \n \n Many infants with Williams syndrome have an extended period of colic or irritability. This typically lasts from 4 to 10 months of age, then resolves. Abnormal sleep patterns with delayed acquisition of sleeping through the night may be associated with the colic. Extreme irritability may also be caused by hypercalcemia in some children with WS. \n \n Dental abnormalities \n \n Slightly small, widely spaced teeth are common in children with Williams syndrome. They also may have a variety of abnormalities of occlusion (bite), tooth shape or appearance. Most of these dental changes are readily amenable to orthodontic correction. \n \n Kidney abnormalities \n \n There is a slightly increased frequency of problems with kidney structure and/or function. \n \n Hernias \n \n Inguinal (groin) and umbilical hernias are more common in Williams syndrome than in the general population. \n \n Hyperacusis (sensitive hearing) \n \n Children with Williams syndrome often have more sensitive hearing than other children; certain frequencies or noise levels can be painful and/or startling to the individual. This condition often improves with age. \n \n Musculoskeletal problems \n \n Young children with Williams syndrome often have low muscle tone and joint laxity. As the children get older, joint stiffness (contractures) may develop. Physical therapy is very helpful in improving muscle tone, strength and joint range of motion. \n \n Overly friendly (excessively social) personality \n \n Individuals with Williams syndrome have a very endearing personality. They have a unique strength in their expressive language skills, and are extremely polite. They are typically unafraid of strangers and show a greater interest in contact with adults than with their peers. \n \n Developmental delay, learning challenges and attention deficit disorder \n \n Most people with Williams syndrome will have mild to severe learning differences and cognitive challenges. Young children with Williams syndrome often experience developmental delays. Milestones such as walking, talking and toilet training are often achieved somewhat later than is considered normal. Distractibility is a common problem in mid-childhood, which can improve as the children get older. \n \n Older children and adults with Williams syndrome often demonstrate intellectual \"strengths and weaknesses.\" There are some intellectual areas (such as speech, long term memory, and social skills) in which performance is quite strong, while other intellectual areas (such as fine motor and spatial relations) show significant weakness.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Cedric Anderson had threatened his estranged wife before, but nobody realized how dangerous he really was until he opened fire in her San Bernardino classroom on Monday, police say. San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said Tuesday that Anderson, 53, who killed Karen Smith and an 8-year-old special-needs student before shooting himself, was allowed to go to Smith's classroom at North Park Elementary School because staff members recognized him, the San Bernardino Sun reports. Burguan says Smith, who separated from Anderson in March after less than three months of marriage, only told close family members that he had threatened her. \"She effectively kept her private life private,\" the chief says. The chief adds that Smith, who had moved back in with her adult children, believed Anderson's threats were only a cry for attention. The 8-year-old boy killed as he stood behind Smith has been identified as Jonathan Martinez, who had the genetic condition Williams syndrome, which causes developmental delays, the Desert Sun reports. School district Superintendent Dale Marsden says Jonathan's parents, who described him as a happy boy, want his death to spread awareness of the disease. A GoFundMe campaign to help the boy's family raised nearly $100,000 by the end of Tuesday. Marsden says a 9-year-old boy hit in the upper body by a bullet who was hospitalized in critical condition is \"up and watching cartoons\" and is expected to make a full recovery."

Cells in nearly any part of the body can become cancer, and can spread to other areas of the body. To learn more about how cancers start and spread, see What Is Cancer? \n \n Multiple myeloma is a cancer formed by malignant plasma cells. Normal plasma cells are found in the bone marrow and are an important part of the immune system. \n \n The immune system is made up of several types of cells that work together to fight infections and other diseases. Lymphocytes (lymph cells) are the main cell type of the immune system. The major types of lymphocytes are T cells and B cells. \n \n When B cells respond to an infection, they mature and change into plasma cells. Plasma cells make the antibodies (also called immunoglobulins) that help the body attack and kill germs. Lymphocytes are in many areas of the body, such as lymph nodes, the bone marrow, the intestines, and the bloodstream. Plasma cells, however, are mainly found in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside some hollow bones. In addition to plasma cells, normal bone marrow has cells that make the different normal blood cells. \n \n When plasma cells become cancerous and grow out of control, they can produce a tumor called a plasmacytoma. These tumors generally develop in a bone, but they are also rarely found in other tissues. If someone has only a single plasma cell tumor, the disease is called an isolated (or solitary) plasmacytoma. If someone has more than one plasmacytoma, they have multiple myeloma. \n \n Multiple myeloma is characterized by several features, including: \n \n Low blood counts \n \n In multiple myeloma, the overgrowth of plasma cells in the bone marrow can crowd out normal blood-forming cells, leading to low blood counts. This can cause anemia \u2013 a shortage of red blood cells. People with anemia become pale, weak, and fatigued. Multiple myeloma can also cause the level of platelets in the blood to become low (called thrombocytopenia). This can lead to increased bleeding and bruising. Another condition that can develop is leukopenia \u2013 a shortage of normal white blood cells. This can lead to problems fighting infections. \n \n Bone and calcium problems \n \n Myeloma cells also interfere with cells that help keep the bones strong. Bones are constantly being remade to keep them strong. Two major kinds of bone cells normally work together to keep bones healthy and strong. The cells that lay down new bone are called osteoblasts. The cells that break down old bone are called osteoclasts. Myeloma cells make a substance that tells the osteoclasts to speed up dissolving the bone. Since the osteoblasts do not get a signal to put down new bone, old bone is broken down without new bone to replace it. This makes the bones weak and they break easily. Fractured bones are a major problem in people with myeloma. This increase in bone break-down can also raise calcium levels in the blood. (Problems caused by high calcium levels are discussed in the section \u201cHow is multiple myeloma diagnosed?\u201d) \n \n Infections \n \n Abnormal plasma cells do not protect the body from infections. As mentioned before, normal plasma cells produce antibodies that attack germs. For example, if you developed pneumonia, normal plasma cells would produce antibodies aimed at the specific bacteria that were causing the illness. These antibodies help the body attack and kill the bacteria. In multiple myeloma, the myeloma cells crowd out the normal plasma cells, so that antibodies to fight the infection can\u2019t be made. The antibody made by the myeloma cells does not help fight infections. That\u2019s because the myeloma cells are just many copies of the same plasma cell \u2013 all making copies of the same exact (or monoclonal) antibody. \n \n Kidney problems \n \n The antibody made by myeloma cells can harm the kidneys. This can lead to kidney damage and even kidney failure. \n \n Monoclonal gammopathy \n \n Having many copies of the same antibody is known as a monoclonal gammopathy. This condition can be found with a blood test. Although people with multiple myeloma have a monoclonal gammopathy, not everyone with monoclonal gammopathy has multiple myeloma. It can also occur in other diseases, such as Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and some lymphomas. It can also occur in a disorder known as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), which does not cause problems like multiple myeloma does. However, some people with MGUS will eventually go on to develop multiple myeloma or other diseases. \n \n Light chain amyloidosis \n \n Antibodies are made up of protein chains joined together \u2013 2 short light chains and 2 longer heavy chains. In light chain amyloidosis, abnormal plasma cells make too many light chains. These light chains can deposit in tissues, where they build up. This accumulation of light chains can lead to an abnormal protein in tissues known as amyloid. The buildup of amyloid in certain organs can lead them to enlarge and not work well. For example, when amyloid builds up in the heart, it can cause an irregular heart beat and cause the heart to enlarge and get weaker. A weak heart can lead to a condition called congestive heart failure, with symptoms like shortness of breath and swelling in the legs. Amyloid in the kidneys can cause them to work poorly. This may not cause symptoms early on, but the poor kidney function may be found on blood tests. If it gets worse, amyloid in the kidney can lead to kidney failure. See the section \u201cSigns and symptoms of multiple myeloma\u201d for more information about the signs and symptoms of light chain amyloidosis. \n \n Other names for light chain amyloidosis include AL and primary amyloidosis. This is sometimes considered a separate disease from multiple myeloma, but because treatment is often similar to that of myeloma, we will discuss it in this document. \n \n Light chain amyloidosis is only one of the diseases where amyloid builds ups and causes problems. Amyloidosis can also be caused by a genetic (hereditary) disease called familial amyloidosis. Long-standing (chronic) infection and/or inflammation can also cause amyloidosis. This is known as secondary or AA amyloidosis. This document does not talk about these other kinds of amyloidosis. \n \n Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance \n \n In monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), abnormal plasma cells produce many copies of the same antibody (a monoclonal antibody protein). However, these plasma cells do not form an actual tumor or mass and do not cause any of the other problems seen in multiple myeloma. MGUS usually does not affect a person\u2019s health. In particular, it doesn\u2019t cause weak bones, high calcium levels, kidney problems, or low blood counts. It\u2019s most often found when a routine blood test finds a high level of protein in the blood and further testing shows the protein is a monoclonal antibody. In MGUS, the number of plasma cells may be increased, but they still make up less than 10% of the cells in the bone marrow. \n \n Some people with MGUS will eventually develop multiple myeloma, lymphoma, or amyloidosis. Each year, about 1% of people with MGUS develops one of these diseases. The risk is higher in people whose protein levels are particularly high. Patients with MGUS don\u2019t need treatment, but they are watched closely to see if they get a disease that does need to be treated, such as multiple myeloma. \n \n Recently, scientists have studied the genes of the plasma cells in patients with MGUS. They found that the genetic make-up of these plasma cells resembles myeloma plasma cells more than it resembles that of normal plasma cells. This suggests that these cells are truly malignant, not just slow growing. Because people with MGUS are generally elderly, they may not live long enough for it to transform into myeloma. \n \n Solitary plasmacytomas \n \n This is another type of abnormal plasma cell growth. Rather than many tumors in different locations as in multiple myeloma, there is only one tumor, hence the name solitary plasmacytoma. \n \n Most often, a solitary plasmacytoma develops in a bone, where it may be called an isolated plasmacytoma of bone. When a plasmacytoma starts in other tissues (such as the lungs or other organs), it is called an extramedullary plasmacytoma. Solitary plasmacytomas are most often treated with radiation therapy. Sometimes surgery may be used for a single extramedullary plasmacytoma. As long as no other plasmacytomas are found later on, the patient\u2019s outlook is usually excellent. However, since many people with a solitary plasmacytoma will develop multiple myeloma, these people are watched closely for signs of this disease. ||||| (CNN) -- Former NBC news anchor Tom Brokaw is being treated for cancer, but doctors are very encouraged by the progress he is making, NBC said Tuesday. \n \n Brokaw, 74, was \"diagnosed with multiple myeloma, a cancer affecting blood cells in the bone marrow, in August at the Mayo Clinic,\" the network said. \n \n \"His doctors are optimistic about the outcome of the treatment he is receiving, and Brokaw said he remains 'the luckiest guy I know,'\" it said. \n \n Brokaw sat in the anchor chair of the \"NBC Nightly News\" from 1982 until he stepped aside in 2004 to serve as a special correspondent for the network.

(Associated Press) \n \n Several alleged victims of tabloid phone hacking in Britain will soon file lawsuits against a second newspaper group, Piers Morgan's former employer Trinity Mirror PLC, their lawyer said Friday. \n \n Mark Lewis said the claims would be filed in \"a few weeks,\" but would not disclose identities of his clients or say precisely when the papers would be lodged at court. \n \n Lewis represents the family of Milly Dowler, a 13-year-old girl abducted and murdered by a pedophile in 2002. The revelation a month ago that her voicemail messages had been accessed by the News of the World while she was still missing outraged British opinion, and triggered a crisis for Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. \n \n The phone hacking scandal centers on allegations that journalists eavesdropped on private phone messages, bribed police for information and hacked email accounts. \n \n So far the crisis has centered on Murdoch's media empire, leading him to shut down the News of the World tabloid and abandon a bid to take over British Sky Broadcasting. Several former executives of the newspaper have been arrested by police investigating the eavesdropping. \n \n But there have also been allegations of hacking by other newspapers. This week Paul McCartney's ex-wife, Heather Mills, claimed in a BBC interview that she was hacked by a Trinity Mirror journalist in 2001. \n \n McCartney said Thursday that he planned to contact police over the claim. \n \n \"I will be talking to them about that,\" McCartney told the U.S. television journalists by videolink from Cincinnati, Ohio. \n \n The BBC did not identify the journalist cited by Mills, but said it was not Piers Morgan, who was editor of the group's flagship tabloid, the Daily Mirror. between 1995 and 2004. \n \n Morgan has repeatedly denied ordering anyone to spy on voicemails or knowingly publishing stories obtained through hacking. \n \n But in an article published by the Daily Mail in 2006, Morgan said that he had been played a tape of a message McCartney had left on Mills' cell phone in the wake of one of their fights. \n \n \"It was heartbreaking,\" Morgan wrote. \"He sounded lonely, miserable and desperate, and even sang 'We Can Work It Out' into the answerphone.\" \n \n Questions over how Morgan came to hear the message have led several British lawmakers to call on him to return to the U.K. and explain himself. \n \n Lawmaker John Whittingdale, chairman of a parliamentary committee that is investigating hacking by the News of the World, said Thursday that Morgan \"absolutely should\" come to Britain to answer questions. \n \n Whittingdale said \"there is evidence to suggest that other newspapers were involved in phone hacking\" _ and that police should investigate. \n \n Both Trinity Mirror and the publisher of Britain's Daily Mail newspaper, keen to stop the scandal spreading to them, have announced reviews of editorial procedures in the wake of the revelations about the scale of wrongdoing at the News of the World. \n \n Meanwhile, an activist who hit Murdoch with a shaving foam pie as the mogul testified to British lawmakers last month was appealing Friday against a six-week jail sentence. \n \n Jonathan May-Bowles was sentenced Tuesday for assaulting the 80-year-old media tycoon as he gave evidence to the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee. \n \n ___ \n \n Frazier Moore and Noaki Schwartz in Los Angeles and David Stringer and Raphael G. Satter in London contributed to this report. \n \n ___ \n \n Jill Lawless can be reached at http://twitter.com/JillLawless ||||| First, a prosecutor would need to appeal to \u2013 perhaps exploit \u2013 Stone\u2019s natural sense of self-preservation. For all the trouble he has been mixed up in over his long career, Stone has never been at any real risk of serving time behind bars. Friday\u2019s indictment might change his bearing a bit. It\u2019s one thing to rail publicly against the possibility of a theoretical future indictment, but another to see seven federal criminal charges, carrying a total maximum sentence of 50 years, in black and white. As a practical matter, Stone isn\u2019t looking at anything close to 50 years, but he easily could be facing five years or so if convicted on all counts. For a 66 year-old man like Stone, that could mean most or all of the rest of his life, which has to be at least a bit sobering. And the evidence laid out in the indictment seems locked in; over and over again, the indictment quotes Stone\u2019s lies and then cites hard proof \u2013 typically Stone\u2019s own texts \u2013 to prove that he lied. A good prosecutor could make a compelling case that cooperation offers Stone his best and most realistic chance to get through the case without having to serve time. \n \n \n \n \n \n Second, as much as we don\u2019t like to acknowledge it in our quest for pure justice, money matters. It is expensive to defend yourself in federal court, and it is jaw-droppingly costly to go to trial. Stone has flashed vulnerability on this, declaring that he faces legal fees of $2 million \u2013 not an outrageous estimate, if a trial is involved \u2013 while noting that he is \u201cnot a wealthy man\u201d and begging for crowdfunded donations. \n \n \n \n \n \n Third, Stone is nothing if not ego-driven. We all are, of course, but Stone\u2019s in his own league. A prosecutor might therefore make a pitch to Stone along these lines. You can stay quiet, you can be a \u201cstand-up\u201d guy, you can fight the government and maybe even go to trial.

    "input": "Remains of major new prehistoric stone monument at Durrington Walls discovered The remains of a major new prehistoric stone monument have been discovered less than 3 kilometres from Stonehenge. Using cutting edge, multi-sensor technologies the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project has revealed evidence for a large stone monument hidden beneath the bank of the later Durrington Walls 'super-henge'. \n \n Read more on this latest discovery... \n \n The \"Stonehenge Hidden Landscape Project\" \n \n Stonehenge occupies one of the richest archaeological landscapes in the world, recorded in the course of intensive archaeological and antiquarian research over several hundred years, yet much of this landscape effectively remains terra incognita. This project aims to address gaps in our knowledge and to advance the understanding of the Stonehenge landscape by conducting a cutting-edge geophysical and remote sensing survey at unprecedented scale. \n \n The results of the proposed work will be used to create a highly detailed archaeological map of the 'invisible' landscape, providing the basis for a full interpretative synthesis of all existing remote sensing and geophysical data from the study area, For the first it will thus be possible to create total digital models of the Stonehenge landscape at a true 'landscape scale' that will not only transcend the immediate surrounds of individual monuments within the study area, but will also tie them together within a seamless map of sub-surface and surface archaeological features and structures. \n \n The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, led by the University of Birmingham in conjunction with the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology, is the largest project of its kind. \n \n The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project is a collaboration between the University of Birmingham, the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology, Vienna and its international partners, the University of Bradford, the University of St Andrews, and the 'ORBit' Research Group of the Department of Soil Management at the University of Ghent, Belgium. \n \n The project operates under the auspices of the National Trust and English Heritage. ||||| We walked the Avenue, the ancient route along which the stones were first dragged from the River Avon. For centuries, this was the formal path to the great henge, but now the only hint of its existence was an indentation or two in the tall grass. It was a fine English summer\u2019s day, with thin, fast clouds above, and as we passed through fields dotted with buttercups and daisies, cows and sheep, we could have been hikers anywhere, were it not for the ghostly monument in the near distance. \n \n Faint as the Avenue was, Vince Gaffney hustled along as if it were illuminated by runway lights. A short, sprightly archaeologist of 56, from Newcastle upon Tyne in northeast England, he knows this landscape as well as anyone alive: has walked it, breathed it, studied it for uncounted hours. He has not lost his sense of wonder. Stopping to fix the monument in his eyeline, and reaching out toward the stones on the horizon, he said, \u201cLook, it becomes cathedralesque.\u201d \n \n Gaffney\u2019s latest research effort, the Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project, is a four-year collaboration between a British team and the Ludwig Boltzmann Institute for Archaeological Prospection and Virtual Archaeology in Austria that has produced the first detailed underground survey of the area surrounding Stonehenge, totaling more than four square miles. The results are astonishing. The researchers have found buried evidence of more than 15 previously unknown or poorly understood late Neolithic monuments: henges, barrows, segmented ditches, pits. To Gaffney, these findings suggest a scale of activity around Stonehenge far beyond what was previously suspected. \u201cThere was sort of this idea that Stonehenge sat in the middle and around it was effectively an area where people were probably excluded,\u201d Gaffney told me, \u201ca ring of the dead around a special area\u2014to which few people might ever have been admitted....Perhaps there were priests, big men, whatever they were, inside Stonehenge having processions up the Avenue, doing...something extremely mysterious. Of course that sort of analysis depends on not knowing what\u2019s actually in the area around Stonehenge itself. It was terra incognita, really.\u201d \n \n Nobody has yet put a spade in the ground to verify the new findings, which were painstakingly gathered by geophysicists and others wielding magnetometers and ground-penetrating radars that scan the ground to detect structures and objects several yards below the surface. But Gaffney has no doubt of the work\u2019s value. \u201cThis is among the most important landscapes, and probably the most studied landscape, in the world,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the area has been absolutely transformed by this survey. Won\u2019t be the same again.\u201d \n \n *** \n \n The joys and frustrations of all archaeological study\u2014perhaps all historical inquiry\u2014come into particularly sharp relief at Stonehenge. Even to the most casual observer, the monument is deeply significant. Those vast stones, standing in concentric rings in the middle of a basin on Salisbury Plain, carefully placed by who-knows-who thousands of years ago, must mean something. But nobody can tell us what. Not exactly. The clues that remain will always prove insufficient to our curiosity. Each archaeological advance yields more questions, and more theories to be tested. Our ignorance shrinks by fractions. What we know is always dwarfed by what we can never know. \n \n Take the big question: Was Stonehenge predominantly a temple, a parliament or a graveyard? Was it a healing ground? We don\u2019t know, for sure. We know that people were buried there, and that the stones are aligned in astronomically important ways. We also understand, because of the chemical composition of animal bones found nearby and the provenance of the stones, that people traveled hundreds of miles to visit Stonehenge. But we cannot say, with certainty, why. \n \n Try a simpler question: How did the bluestones, which weigh between four and eight tons apiece, arrive at the site, nearly 5,000 years ago, from 170 miles away in West Wales? Land or sea? Both alternatives explode with possibilities, and nobody has an impregnable theory. Mike Parker Pearson of University College London is working on a new idea that the bluestones might have been lifted onto huge wooden lattices and carried by dozens of men to the site. But it\u2019s just a theory. We can\u2019t know, definitively. We can only have better-informed questions. \n \n The ineffability of Stonehenge has not dulled our appetite. The site has long proved irresistible to diggers. In 1620, the Duke of Buckingham had his men excavate right in the center of the monument. Although they did not know it at the time, they dug on the site of a prehistoric pit. Buckingham\u2019s men found skulls of cattle \u201cand other beasts\u201d and large quantities of \u201cburnt coals or charcoals\u201d\u2014but no treasure, as they had hoped. \n \n In the 19th century, \u201cbarrow-digging,\u201d or the excavation of prehistoric monuments and burial hills, was a popular pastime among the landed gentry. In 1839, a naval officer named Captain Beamish dug out an estimated 400 cubic feet of soil from the northeast of the Altar Stone at Stonehenge. As Parker Pearson notes in his book Stonehenge, Beamish\u2019s \u201cbig hole was probably the final blow for any prehistoric features...that once lay at Stonehenge\u2019s center.\u201d \n \n Work at Stonehenge became less invasive. In 1952, Willard Libby\u2014the American chemist and later a Nobel Prize winner\u2014used his new radiocarbon dating technique on a piece of charcoal from a pit within Stonehenge to date the monument to 1848 B.C., give or take 275 years. That date has since been refined several times. The prevailing opinion is that the first stones were erected on the site around 2600 B.C. (although the building of Stonehenge was carried out over a millennium, and there were centuries of ritual activity at the site before the stones were in place). \n \n In 2003, Parker Pearson conducted his own survey, concentrating on the nearby settlement at Durrington Walls and the area between there and the River Avon. Based on huts, tools and animal bones he uncovered, he concluded that Durrington Walls likely housed the workers who built Stonehenge. Based on an analysis of human remains he later excavated from Stonehenge, he also surmised that, far from being a site of quotidian religious activity, Stonehenge served as a cemetery\u2013a \u201cplace for the dead.\u201d \n \n The Stonehenge Hidden Landscapes Project is different from everything that came before it. When Gaffney and his team started their work, they were less interested in theories than in data. To that end, they concentrated on taking what amounts to a three-dimensional and yards-deep photograph of the entire landscape. \u201cThe perceived wisdom was driven by the monuments we knew about,\u201d says Gaffney. \u201cWe\u2019ve put in the data between the monuments.\u201d \n \n *** \n \n Chris Gaffney, Vince\u2019s younger, slighter and less voluble brother, was one of the instigators of this new approach. The duo\u2019s grandfather was a metalwork teacher from Newcastle with an interest in archaeology, who took his clever grandchildren on trips to Hadrian\u2019s Wall, the old barrier between the Roman Empire and the blasted north. Small wonder that Vince became an archaeologist and Chris a geophysicist, now at the University of Bradford. \n \n The Gaffney brothers\u2019 interest in new technologies that were becoming available to archaeologists led them to the first GPS-guided magnetometer systems. A magnetometer has sensors that allow a geophysicist to see evidence of historic building, and even ancient ditch-digging, beneath the soil by mapping variations in the earth\u2019s magnetic field. The GPS-guided versions were able to pinpoint some of those discoveries to within one centimeter. The Gaffneys believed that Stonehenge scholarship needed a massive magnetometer- and radar-led survey of the whole site. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t know if anything\u2019s there,\u201d Vince Gaffney recalled. \u201cSo we\u2019re constructing various hypotheses on the basis of something we don\u2019t know.\u201d \n \n Around the same time, an Austrian archaeologist named Wolfgang Neubauer, now of the Boltzmann Institute, was hoping to conduct large-scale projects all over Europe using tools including GPS magnetometers and ground-penetrating radar. Neubauer\u2019s team had also developed software to process the 40 or 50 gigabytes of raw data that these instruments could create in a day. Suddenly, instead of waiting weeks or months to see what the machines had found, it was possible to cover several acres with magnetometers and radar in a day and to display that information on a screen almost instantaneously. \n \n One of the areas Neubauer wanted to scan was Stonehenge, and in the spring of 2009 he contacted Vince Gaffney. A few months later, the Boltzmann Institute and the University of Birmingham\u2014plus several other British and European universities, museums and companies that contributed expertise and resources\u2014began their collaboration at Stonehenge. \n \n Their first days on site, Gaffney recalled, were \u201clike a geophysical circus has come to town.\u201d Tractors pushed the ground-penetrating radars, which looked like high-powered lawn mowers. All-terrain vehicles dragged the magnetometer sensors on long strings. Delicate instruments covering hard, uneven ground kept mechanics and technicians busy. \u201cI have seen one of our magnetometers shear clear apart in front of me,\u201d said Gaffney. \u201cIt was back in service the next day.\u201d In all, the fieldwork took about 120 days, spread over four years. \n \n *** \n \n In a multimedia room at the University of Birmingham there was a vast touch screen, six feet by nine, on which a new map of the Stonehenge landscape appeared. Gaffney pointed out the key features. \n \n There was Stonehenge itself, marked by the familiar circles. To the north was the long, thin strip called the Stonehenge Cursus or the Greater Cursus, which was demarcated by ditches, and ran east to west for nearly two miles. (The Cursus was given its name by the antiquarian William Stukeley in the 18th century because it looked like an ancient Roman race course. Its construction predates the first building work at Stonehenge by several hundred years.) Gaffney also pointed out the Cursus Barrows\u2014hillocks containing mass human graves\u2014just south of the Cursus itself, and King Barrow Ridge to the east. \n \n Scattered all over the map were blotches of black: features without names. These were new finds, including the more than 15 possible new or poorly understood Neolithic monuments. Gaffney emphasized possible, acknowledging that it will require digging\u2014\u201cthe testimony of the spade\u201d\u2014to discover precisely what was there. \n \n Standing in front of this constellation of evidence, he seemed unable to decide where to start, like a child at the Christmas tree. \u201cThese are little henge monuments,\u201d he said, touching the screen to highlight a group of black smudges. \u201cNice little entrance there, and a ditch. These things we know nothing about.\u201d \n \n He saved his greatest enthusiasm for the discoveries that had been made in the Cursus. This feature, said Gaffney, had always been thought of as a \u201cbloody great barrier to the north of Stonehenge.\u201d Nobody knew quite what it was for. Because the Cursus runs east to west, archaeologists have always believed that its presence owes something to the passage of the sun. The monument must be significant: It was dug in the fourth millennium B.C. using antler picks\u2014hundreds of thousands of man-hours went into its construction. \n \n The Hidden Landscapes Project\u2019s instruments discovered several new clues. First of all, they found gaps in the ditch, in particular a very large break in the northern side, to allow people to enter and exit the Cursus. Now, instead of seeing the Cursus exclusively as a monument that encouraged movement along the path of the sun, east to west, Gaffney began to consider these gaps as \u201cchannels through the landscape\u201d to guide the movement of people north to south. \n \n A bigger discovery, Gaffney says, was a \u201cbloody huge\u201d pit about five yards in diameter at the eastern end of the Cursus. Today it lies buried at least three feet below the surface of the ground. Such a pit was much too large for a practical use\u2014for instance, burying trash\u2014because of the labor involved in digging it. In the archaeologists\u2019 minds it could only have ritual implications, as \u201ca marker of some kind,\u201d Gaffney said. What\u2019s more, if you drew a straight line between the pit and the heelstone at Stonehenge, it ran directly along the final section of the Avenue, on the path of the sunrise on the summer solstice. \n \n \u201cWe thought, That\u2019s a bit of a coincidence!\u201d Gaffney recalled. \u201cThat was the point at which we thought, What\u2019s at the other end? And there\u2019s another pit! Two pits, marking the midsummer sunrise and the midsummer solstice, set within a monument that\u2019s meant to be something to do with the passage of the sun.\u201d \n \n With his hands passing over the map, Gaffney showed how\u2014on the longest days of the year\u2014the pits formed a triangle with Stonehenge marking sunrise and sunset. \n \n \u201cNobody had ever seen these pits before,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut they link the area of Stonehenge with the Cursus directly. Either these things have been put inside the Cursus to mark these points, or the Cursus has been wrapped around them.\u201d \n \n What was so interesting about the Cursus pits was that they told a story about the landscape. The \u201csunrise\u201d pit was visible from Stonehenge, but the \u201csunset\u201d pit was not\u2014it was nestled behind a ridge, and could have been seen only if there had been fire and smoke coming from it. (At some point the pits will have to be excavated for evidence of such activity.) These discoveries fed into a larger understanding of Stonehenge as \u201cdiachronic\u201d\u2014operating in light and dark, sunrise and sunset, day and night. \n \n \u201cThe point I think we\u2019re coming to,\u201d said Gaffney, \u201cis that increasingly we can see the area around Stonehenge as providing extensive evidence for complex liturgical movement\u2014which we can now understand, largely because we know where things are.\u201d \n \n Parker Pearson, for his part, takes a cautious view of the new research. \u201cUntil you dig holes, you just don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got,\u201d he told me in his office at University College London. \u201cWhat date it is, how significant it is. [There are] extraordinary new features coming up, and we\u2019re thinking well, what are they?\u201d \n \n To be sure, he said the data from the Hidden Landscapes Project \u201cbacks up the pattern we\u2019ve already been seeing for some years. We have an excessive number of solstice-aligned monuments in that landscape. Nowhere in the rest of Europe comes even close.\u201d He added, \u201cThis is fantastic stuff that\u2019s been done, and it\u2019s raised a whole series of new questions,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take years.\u201d \n \n *** \n \n The clouds shifted in front of the sun, dappling the landscape with shadow. Gaffney and I were walking the Avenue, 300 yards or so from Stonehenge, and in the distance a string of barrows gleamed like opals. Although he acknowledged the fallibility of all archaeological projection (\u201cIn the end,\u201d he said, \u201cwe are all wrong\u201d), his work has led him to a new interpretation of how Stonehenge was used. \n \n Gaffney\u2019s idea was not to focus on Stonehenge itself, but on \u201cprocessionality\u201d within the whole landscape. He imagined people moving around the area like Roman Catholics processing through the Stations of the Cross. He recalled an Easter Friday ritual he saw in Croatia, in which a \u201cbloke with a cross\u201d led fellow barefoot celebrants on a miles-long trip. In Gaffney\u2019s view, the building of the great stone circle was a \u201cmonumentalizing\u201d of a similar, if heathen, procession. \n \n As we walked downhill through the fields, Gaffney stopped from time to time to point out the hillocks in which \u201cthe illustrious dead\u201d were buried. He also noted how the Avenue was not a straight line between the Avon and Stonehenge, but rather a series of tacks that brought the visitor to the Stonehenge site in a \u201ctheatrical\u201d way, along the line of sunrise on the summer solstice. \n \n He thrust himself into the mind of a Bronze Age visitor to the site. \u201cYou will have seen nothing like it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have been massively impressive.\u201d Soon we descended into a valley called Stonehenge Bottom, only a hundred yards or so from the great stones. \u201cThey\u2019re disappearing....Watch, just watch!\u201d he said. \n \n Within a few yards, the monument became invisible. When you picture Stonehenge in your mind\u2019s eye, you imagine the concentric rings of vast stones standing in a desolate open landscape, visible for miles around. But now, here we were, a hundred yards away, and the thing had gone. \n \n We stood in a field, watched by some lethargic cows, and savored the strangeness of the moment. Then, as we stepped uphill, Stonehenge re-emerged on the horizon. It happened fast. The lintels, then the great sarsens, then the smaller bluestones were suddenly before us. \n \n Gaffney\u2019s voice lifted. He spoke about Jerusalem Syndrome: the feeling of intense emotion experienced by pilgrims on their first sighting of the Holy City. In the prehistoric world, there was no conception of God as he was understood by the later Abrahamic faiths. But, said Gaffney, as Stonehenge reappeared before us, \u201cwhatever the ancient version of Jerusalem Syndrome is, that\u2019s what you\u2019re feeling now.\u201d ||||| The mysteries of Stonehenge are revealed sometimes by unusual methods\u2014forgetting to water its grass or whacking its stones with quartz.

Two pits inside the Cursus appears to be aligned with the rising and setting sun on the summer solstice when seen from the Stonehenge's heel stone.

For the 2015 solstice, they will have a bit more room to spread out.

Mexican forensic experts recovered 28 charred bodies from a clandestine grave on the outskirts of this city where police engaged... (Associated Press) \n \n IGUALA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 A clandestine grave on the outskirts of a Mexican city where police clashed with student protesters a week ago contained 28 bodies but the remains are too damaged for immediate identification, state officials said. \n \n Guerrero State Prosecutor Inaky Blanco said he could not say whether any of the dead could be some of the 43 college students reported missing after the violent confrontation in Iguala, located about 120 miles (200 kilometers) south of Mexico City. \n \n He said genetic testing of the remains could take two weeks to two months. \n \n Blanco said one of the people detained in the case had told investigators that 17 students were taken to the grave site on the outskirts of the Iguala and killed there. But he stressed that investigators had not confirmed the person's story. \n \n \"As long as the identity of the cadavers has not been resolved we will continue the search\" for the missing students, he said Sunday. \n \n State police and prosecutors have been investigating the Iguala city police for misconduct during a series of violent incidents last weekend that resulted in six shooting deaths and more than two dozen people injured. Investigators said video showed police taking away an undetermined number of student protesters. \n \n Authorities have presented charges against 29 people in the case, including 22 police officers detained soon after the violence. Three of the suspects are fugitives, including Iguala's police chief. \n \n Blanco said they are still investigating the motive for the crime, adding that some of the police have connections to a local drug cartel. \n \n Blanco said Saturday that some of those arrested provided key clues that led investigators to the six unmarked burial pits on an isolated hillside about a mile (2 kilometers) from the nearest road. The bodies had been put in the pits on top of branches and tree trunks, which were doused with a flammable substance such as gasoline and set on fire. \n \n Vidulfo Rosales, a lawyer helping families of the missing students, said relatives of 37 of the young people already had provided DNA samples that will be used to determine if the recovered remains belong to any of the students. \n \n As investigators worked at the grave site, up to 2,000 protesters blocked a main highway in the state capital of Chilpancingo demanding justice. \"You took them alive, we want them returned alive,\" read a huge banner hung across the road linking Mexico City and Acapulco. \n \n The mother of one of the missing youths said her son, 17-year-old Luis Angel Abarca Carrillo, had enrolled in the Aytozinapa teachers college attended by the missing students in order to get ahead in life and not be a poor farmer like his brothers. \n \n \"But now look what they did to him, he hasn't reappeared,\" said 60-year-old Margarita Carrillo. \n \n Mexico's National Human Rights Commission opened its own investigation into the case for possible \"serious human rights abuses,\" such as extrajudicial executions and forced disappearances by Iguala city police. \n \n The commission said in a statement Sunday that it had warned about the \"delicate\" situation in Guerrero, a southern state where poverty feeds social unrest and drug gangs clash over territory. \n \n Anger over the discovery of the graves exploded Saturday night when a group of young people from the Aytozinapa teachers college protested outside the governor's residence in Chilpancingo.

The judge set her bail at $3 million or $9 million bond. Graswald is in Orange County Jail. \n \n Graswald was beneficiary on two of Viafore's life insurance policies, and stood to gain $250,000 from his death, said Assistant District Attorney Julie Mohl. \n \n State police shared a photo of the kayaks Angelika Graswald and Vincent Viafore used on the day of his death at a 2015 press conference. Viafore was in the blue kayak, police said. (Photo: State police) \n \n Graswald and Viafore, a 46-year-old Poughkeepsie resident, left Plum Point in kayaks around 4:15 p.m. on April 19. They kayaked to Bannerman Island, where Graswald was a volunteer, and stayed about two hours, Mohl said. \n \n When the couple was about two-thirds of the way back, \"the victim's kayak filled with water, causing it to capsize,\" Mohl said. \"The victim was holding onto the kayak...he went under water and drowned,\" around 7:15 p.m. \n \n Graswald did not call for help until 7:40 p.m., Mohl said. While she was on the phone with 911, Graswald said she could see Viafore, and the call was cut off when she herself capsized, Mohl said. \n \n Witnesses say they saw Graswald \"intentionally\" capsized, and when she was questioned about inconsistencies in her statements, \"she said she capsized her kayak on purposely,\" because she wanted authorities to believe she tried to save Viafore, Mohl said. \"She stated that she tampered with the victim's kayak...she knew it would contribute to his death.\" \n \n Graswald told authorities she \"felt happiness and relief\" as she watched him go into the water, Mohl said. Graswald said \"it felt good knowing he was going to die,\" and that she felt trapped in the relationship with him. \n \n Graswald detailed where the equipment could be found, but not Viafore's body, Mohl added. \n \n State police are still searching for Viafore's body. \n \n Graswald was also aware that she was the primary beneficiary on two of Viafore's life insurance policies, and \"talked about what she could do with the money\" after his death, Mohl said. \n \n Portale said he has reason to believe any statements Graswald made were coerced. \n \n Graswald, who is originally from Latvia and is in the US with a permanent resident card, is \"very confident sounding, so even if she doesn't understand what you're saying, she'll answer in an affirmative tone,\" Portale said. \"She was suffering from hypothermia and the loss of her fiance, and there was a very clear language barrier.\" \n \n Police originally said there were inconsistencies in Graswald's statements. \n \n And there's a big difference between inconsistencies and a confession, Portale said. \n \n \"What's changed that has caused the government to now characterize my client's statements as a confession?\" Portale added, \"unless we were misled\" by police in the first place. \"It's all going to come out\" and the defense will get \"our hands on the statements, and find out whether they were voluntary or forced.\" \n \n Despite the $3 million bail, Portale classified the hearing as a \"success. The mission today was to find out what, if anything, the indictment was for.\" \n \n As for Graswald, Portale said she is \"depressed, shes hurting...(but) she's confident that by the time this is over, the truth is going to come out. \n \n See Thursday's Journal for the full story. \n \n Angelika Graswald in court at her bail hearing in Goshen on May 13.

(Associated Press) \n \n GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) \u2014 A woman accused of killing her fiance while out paddling on the Hudson River admitted tampering with his kayak and later confessed \"it felt good knowing he would die,\" a prosecutor said Wednesday. \n \n Angelika Graswald, 35, has been indicted on a second-degree murder charge in the death of Vincent Viafore in choppy, chilly water on the evening of April 19. Police say he died 50 miles north of New York City near Bannerman Island, a scenic ruin near the east shore where the longtime U.S. resident from Latvia volunteered as a gardener. \n \n Viafore, 46, was not wearing a life jacket and his body hasn't been found. \n \n Assistant District Attorney Julie Mohl said at a bail hearing Wednesday that Graswald felt trapped and stood to benefit by $250,000 from life insurance policies. Mohl did not detail how Graswald tampered with her fiance's kayak but said it filled with water and capsized. Viafore held onto his boat for 5 to 10 minutes, but Graswald called 911 some 20 minutes after his kayak capsized. Witnesses say she intentionally capsized her own kayak, Mohl said. \n \n \"She felt trapped and it was her only way out,\" Mohl said. \n \n Graswald was rescued by another boater and treated for hypothermia. \n \n She later told investigators that she felt relief and \"it felt good knowing he would die,\" Mohl said. \n \n The judge set bail for Graswald, who appeared in court in shackles and an orange jumpsuit, at $3 million cash. \n \n After the hearing, defense attorney Richard Portale noted the language barrier between Graswald and investigators. He said he would look into whether her statements were voluntary. \n \n \"I'm skeptical of the statements,\" he said. \n \n Since her arrest almost two weeks ago, those who know Graswald have been trying to square the fun-loving woman they knew with the killer described by authorities. \n \n \"The bubbly, bouncy little ballerina girl had a dark side,\" said Mike Colvin, a disc jockey in Poughkeepsie she lived with from November 2008 to June 2010. Still, he never saw Graswald act in a way that suggested violence. \n \n Graswald could walk into a room full of strangers and know everyone's name by the time she left, Colvin said. But he said he also had authority issues and could make unwise snap decisions when angry. She had run through two marriages and a string of jobs by her mid-30s. The impulsiveness apparently contributed to her checkered job history at restaurants and other businesses. \n \n \"They would have staff meetings, and she would just lose it, and eventually she'd have to be let go,\" Colvin said. \"This happened more than once. Not a big fan of authority.\" \n \n Graswald and Viafore appeared to be a happy couple. \n \n Images posted online show an active, affectionate pair spending time outdoors, particularly on the water, and a message about their plans to be married at a spot on the Baltic Sea. Sean Von Clauss, a professional musician from Boston who had known Viafore since boyhood, recalls how the couple would affectionately slow dance when he performed \"Shama Lama Ding Dong.\" \n \n \"They were always in love \u2014 singing, dancing and holding. They were always together,\" Von Clauss said. \"He was thrilled that he found his soul mate.\" \n \n Viafore had a booming laugh and loved to socialize \u2014 the kind of guy who would pick up the check, Von Clauss said. \n \n Von Clauss said he saw Graswald the Friday before her arrest at a gathering to remember Viafore at a bar. She brought a poster board covered with pictures and asked Von Clauss to play \"Shama Lama Ding Dong.\" Usually they would play \"Hotel California\" together, but she asked him to play solo that night. Then she forgot the words. \n \n \"We all kind of sang along, then she sort of finished it by herself,\" he said. \"We all gave her a big round of applause anyway.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press researcher Barbara Sambriski in New York contributed to this report.

Instead of today's large-scale meeting, which was to be livestreamed to Google's 60,000 employees worldwide, smaller groups will meet sometime in the future. \n \n \"We had hoped to have a frank open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward. But our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon, and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally,\" Pichai said in the email. \n \n Pichai said in the email that while the majority of Googlers were supportive of the decision, some wished the company would do more. He said some also worried about not being able to speak freely at work. \n \n \"All of your voices and opinions matter and I want to hear them,\" he said. \n \n Earlier in the day, questions began to be posted to Google's internal message boards that were to be included in today's planned meeting. \n \n \"Can we get an update on progress toward identifying leakers?\" one employee posted, saying multiple Googlers had their team pages leaked to alt-right sites, resulting in a death threat in one instance. \n \n \"I am a moderately conservative Googler,\" wrote one employee, \"and I am and have been scared to share my beliefs. The loud voice here is a liberal one. Conservative voices are hushed. What is leadership doing to ensure Googlers like me feel *invited and accepted*, not just tolerated or safe from angry mobs?\" \n \n Another question asked how to combat Damore's assertion that Google has a lower bar for diversity candidates. \"This is hurting minority Googlers because it creates the perception they are less qualified,\" an employee wrote. \n \n Pichai, who said that parts of Damore's manifesto violated Google's code of conduct, had cut his vacation short to attend today's schediuled meeting. \n \n \"Clearly there's a lot more to discuss as a group -- including how we create a more inclusive environment for all,\" he wrote in an email sent to employees Tuesday. \n \n Damore's 3,300 word manifesto claims there aren't more women in tech roles due to \"biological causes\" while also calling Google left-leaning with a \"politically correct monoculture.\" The memo has spurred a conversation about systematic sexism in Silicon Valley, as well as what is and is not acceptable to debate in a workplace environment. ||||| Google CEO Sundar Pichai has canceled the company\u2019s much-anticipated meeting to talk about gender issues today. The move came after some of its employees expressed concern over online harassment they had begun to receive after their questions and names have been published outside the company on a variety of largely alt-right sites. \n \n \u201cWe had hoped to have a frank, open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward. But our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon, and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally,\u201d wrote Pichai to employees. \u201cGooglers are writing in, concerned about their safety and worried they may be \u2018outed\u2019 publicly for asking a question in the Town Hall.\u201d \n \n Pichai was set to address the search giant\u2019s 60,000 employees in 30 minutes in an all-hands meeting about a recent post by recently fired employee James Damore. In it, the software engineer claimed that women might not be as good as men at tech because of biological reasons, like \u201cneuroticism.\u201d In other words, they could not handle stress and high pressure as much. \n \n Speaking of high pressure, Google is under that for sure in the wake of Damore\u2019s blog and the reaction it has engendered from outside the company, especially among deeply conservative sites like Breitbart and others. \n \n Wired reported earlier that conservative pundit Milo Yiannopoulos \u201cposted on his Facebook page the Twitter biographies of eight Google employees who criticized Damore\u2019s post.\u201d \n \n Sources inside Google said some employees had begun to experience \u201cdoxxing\u201d \u2014 online harassment that can take various forms and is defined as \u201csearching for and publishing private or identifying information about [a particular individual] on the internet, typically with malicious intent.\u201d \n \n Several sites like this one have been publishing internal discussion posts and giving out information on those employees. \n \n In addition, in a move that many Googlers found already disturbing, Damore did his first major interview with alt-right YouTube personality, Stefan Molyneux (ironic, I know, since Google owns the online video giant). You can see that below. \n \n In subsequent interviews, Damore said he had been \u201csmeared\u201d and \u201cshamed\u201d by top execs for his post. \n \n That seems a little bit of a reach since he appears to have intended to throw an atom bomb with it. For example, Damore wrote: \u201cI\u2019m simply stating that the distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why we don\u2019t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership.\u201d \n \n What followed was a list of those differences, including a claim that women were more social and artistic and could not take the stress of high-pressure jobs. Hence, \u201cneuroticism,\u201d or higher anxiety and lower stress tolerance, which he claimed was backed up by studies. \n \n Perhaps most disingenuously, the author also claimed that he had no voice, even after penning a 3,000-word memo that he was able to send companywide and also was read by millions more. \n \n It was probably no surprise that Pichai fired Damore earlier this week for violating Google\u2019s Code of Conduct, noting in an email to staff that \u201cto suggest a group of our colleagues have traits that make them less biologically suited to that work is offensive and not OK.\u201d \n \n Since then, it\u2019s been a tense time for Google and also Silicon Valley, which has been reeling for months amid sexual harassment controversies at companies like Uber and at venture capital firms. While issues around gender and diversity have been a hot-button issue for a long time, the simmering has turned to boiling now. \n \n That has been made worse by the political environment nationwide, which has gotten rather divisive of late. \n \n So goes the country, it seems, so goes tech. \n \n Here is Pichai\u2019s letter: \n \n Dear Googlers, TL;DR Sorry for the late notice but we are going to cancel today\u2019s Town Hall. We had hoped to have a frank, open discussion today as we always do to bring us together and move forward. But our Dory questions appeared externally this afternoon, and on some websites Googlers are now being named personally.

In recognition of Googlers\u2019 concerns, we need to step back and create a better set of conditions for us to have the discussion. So in the coming days we will find several forums to gather and engage with Googlers, where people can feel comfortable to speak freely. We\u2019ll share details soon. Over the past two days, I have had the chance to meet with so many people here, and I have read each of your emails carefully. The vast majority of you are very supportive of our decision. A smaller percentage of you wish we would do more. And some are worried that you cannot speak out at work freely. All of your voices and opinions matter ... and I want to hear them.

But it was Robbins, an economist who has worked for Steve Forbes\u2019s flat-tax campaigns and was a longtime Treasury employee, who conducted a 10-page analysis of the plan in September.

He\u2019s done a very good job and the fellows who were beating on him last night were making a mistake.\u201d \n \n Robbins said he\u2019s performed various economics-related tasks for the campaign.

Gordon confirmed that Robbins scored the 9-9-9 plan for the campaign but declined to address other questions about him. Lowrie did not immediately respond to emails sent to his personal and campaign accounts. \n \n Robbins, who with his wife runs an Arlington operation called Fiscal Policy Associates, Inc., was once a senior fellow at the Texas-based Institute for Policy Innovation. In 2003, Jude Wanniski, who is credited with coining the phrase \u201csupply-side economics,\u201d wrote in a Washington Times op-ed that Robbins is \u201carguably the most respected of all supply-side tax experts.\u201d \n \n Robbins said he served for 16 years in the Treasury Department, leaving in 1985 after working as economist in the Office of Tax Policy and for Ronald Reagan\u2019s assistant secretary for economic affairs.

When you expand the base, we can arrive at the lowest possible rate, which is 9-9-9.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Herman Cain, Washington Post-Bloomberg debate, October 11, 2011 \n \n A family of four making $50,000 a year \u201care still going to have some money left over.\u201d \n \n \u2014 Cain, on MSNBC, October 12, 2011 \n \n It almost sounds like something out of the movie \u201cDave,\u201d in which the accidental president enlists his accountant friend, Murray Blum, to help him figure out the federal budget. \n \n During Tuesday\u2019s Washington Post-Bloomberg debate, Herman Cain, the former chief executive of Godfather\u2019s Pizza, named Rich Lowrie of Cleveland as \u201cmy lead economist\u201d who helped develop Cain\u2019s signature \u201c9-9-9\u201d plan for overhauling the federal tax system. \u201cHe is an economist, and he has worked in the business of wealth creation most of his career,\u201d Cain said. \n \n Actually, according to Lowrie\u2019s Linked-In profile, he has a bachelor\u2019s degree in accountancy from Case Western Reserve University, not economics. Lowrie, in an e-mail, said he did not consider himself an economist, just \u201csenior economic advisor\u201d to the Cain campaign. Donor information maintained by Opensecrets.org shows he has donated $1,500 to Cain in 2010 and 2011, but also contributed $2,300 to Mitt Romney in his first run for the presidency in 2007. \n \n Okay, so Cain may have exaggerated the qualifications of his economic guru. But he has forcefully defended his \u20189-9-9\u2019 plan, both during Tuesday night\u2019s debate and on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cDaily Rundown\u201d on Wednesday. Many readers have asked us to examine the plan and explain it, so let\u2019s take it for a test drive. \n \n The Facts \n \n The \u201c9-9-9\u201d label is actually a bit of misnomer. Cain would toss out much of the current federal tax code and replace it, eventually and only temporarily, with three taxes \u2014 a 9 percent income tax, a 9 percent business transactions tax and a 9 percent federal sales tax. On paper, the first two look like cuts, because payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare (now nearly 15 percent, including corporate contributions) would be repealed. The sales tax would be new, on top of existing state sales taxes. \n \n But note that we said the \u201c9-9-9\u201d would happen eventually \u2014 and then only temporarily. That\u2019s because it is only the second step of a planned three-step process. The first step would cut individual and corporate tax rates to a top 25 percent rate (down from a current high of 35 percent). Then the final step would replace all of the taxes \u2014 even the 9s \u2014 with a national sales tax, known by proponents as a \u201cFair Tax.\u201d \n \n (As denizens of Washington, we find this three-step process to be highly dubious. It takes years, even decades, to fundamentally overhaul the tax code. Herman Cain is going to do this three times in his presidency? But we digress.) \n \n Much attention has focused on whether Cain\u2019s plan, in its 9-9-9 stage, would raise as much revenue as the current tax system. Bloomberg News had calculated it would collect about $2 trillion, thus falling short by about $200 billion a year. But Lowrie sent Bloomberg an analysis on Wednesday that asserted \u201c9-9-9\u201d would actually collect slightly more \u2014 $2.3 trillion. \n \n We think the revenue question is beside the point. Anyone can turn the dials in their computer models to generate the assumptions they want. \n \n Michael Linden of the left-leaning Center for American Progress, for instance, estimates the plan would generate just $1.3 trillion. The biggest difference between the two estimates is that Linden thinks the 9 percent business tax would yield $112 billion a year, and Cain says he would get $862 billion \u2014 a gap that simply demonstrates how a few different assumptions can generate extremely different results. (Linden on Thursday updated his analysis, saying he had underestimated how much revenue the business tax would raise.) \n \n Cain\u2019s proposal is so radical that it makes more sense to examine the potential impact on taxpayers. A key part of Cain\u2019s pitch for the plan during the debate was this: \u201cWhen you expand the base, we can arrive at the lowest possible rate, which is 9-9-9.\u201d \n \n \u201cExpand the base\u201d really means that more taxpayers will pay taxes under his plan. \n \n Right now, nearly half of taxpayers don\u2019t pay income taxes, but they do pay their share of payroll taxes, which amounts to 7.65 percent of wage income (though much of it is capped at $107,000). Cain would also eliminate the earned-income tax credit, which is intended to lift working Americans out of poverty. Many of these workers currently receive tax refunds. \n \n On top of that, Cain would introduce the new sales tax, which would affect lower and moderate-income people who spend most of their income on purchases, not savings and investments. Depending on how you do the math, people now paying zero or negative taxes might be faced with a 27 percent tax on income. \n \n In other words, while on paper Cain is promising a tax cut, in reality tens of millions of lower-income Americans would face tax increases. People in high tax brackets \u2014 28 percent and higher \u2014 would likely see big tax cuts. (As part of his plan, Cain would also eliminate estate taxes and capital gains taxes, which, again, mostly affect higher-income people with stock and real estate investments.) \n \n There have been several interesting analyses done on the \u201c9-9-9\u201d plan. Edward D. Kleinbard of the University of Southern California School of Law identifies several unusual quirks, including a \u201cdisguised one-time 9 percent tax on existing wealth \u2014 no doubt much to the surprise of Mr. Cain and his followers.\u201d Kleinbard, former chief of staff of the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, says that \u201ccontrary to casual impressions, the Plan could be expected to raise substantial amounts of revenue, but does so largely by skewing downwards the distribution of tax burdens when compared to current law.\u201d \n \n Bruce Bartlett, a former Reagan administration official who now calls himself an independent, also offered a critical examination this week on the New York Times Economix blog. He (as did Kleinbard) noted that the business tax allows for no deduction for wages, which he said \u201cis likely to raise the cost of employing workers, even with abolition of the employers\u2019 share of the payroll tax.\u201d \n \n Cain, in his television appearances, glosses over such details. \u201cThe fact that we are taking out embedded taxes that are built into all of the goods and services in this country, prices will not go up,\u201d he asserted on MSNBC. \u201cThey will not go up.\u201d He then gave an example of a family of four earning $50,000. \n \n \u201cToday, under the current system, they will pay over $10,000 in taxes assuming standard deductions and standard exemptions. I've gone through the math, $10,000. Now, with 9-9-9, they're going to pay that 9 percent personal \u2014 that 9 percent tax on their income. So that's only $4,500. They still have $5,500 left over to apply to this sales tax piece. \u2026They are still going to have money left over.\u201d \n \n We\u2019re not sure how Cain calculates that this family now pays $10,000 in taxes, but the reliable Tax Foundation calculator comes up with a much more reasonable figure: a total tax bill of $3,515 \u2014 $690 in federal income taxes and $2,825 in payroll taxes. (The family gets a big income-tax savings from the child tax credit, which Cain would eliminate.) \n \n So, in other words, under Cain\u2019s plan, this family would instantly pay $1,000 more in income taxes. They would also pay additional sales taxes, probably more than $3,000, on their purchases. It\u2019s unclear how the business tax would affect the family\u2019s tax bill but it appears this theoretical family would get no tax cut but instead a 100 percent tax increase. \n \n (The picture changes somewhat if you assume that all the employer-paid payroll taxes automatically would revert to the employee. We\u2019re not sure that\u2019s a good bet given the design of Cain\u2019s business tax, but pro-Cain advocates make that assumption with their own tax calculator. But even under this scenario, the family appears stuck with at least a $2,000 tax increase.) \n \n We take no position on whether it is good or bad to make the tax code less progressive. Perhaps in response to questions, Cain appears to still be tinkering with the plan. In Concord, N.H., he said on Wednesday that, among other changes, he would preserve the deduction for charitable donations and would exempt any used goods, including previously owned homes and cars, from the new 9 percent sales tax. \n \n The Pinocchio Test \n \n We can excuse Cain inflating his adviser\u2019s resume, but his campaign needs to do more to address the fuzzy math behind his tax plan. (We asked the campaign for a copy of Lowrie\u2019s analysis but did not receive a response. UPDATE: The documents are posted below.) \n \n Give Cain credit for thinking boldly, but he\u2019s not talking clearly. As far as we can tell from the limited information Cain has provided, the plan he touts as a big tax cut would actually increase taxes on most Americans. Just like it would be wrong to claim pizza is a low-calorie meal, Cain\u2019s description of the plan\u2019s impact on working Americans is highly misleading. \n \n Three Pinocchios \n \n (About our rating scale) \n \n Read the Cain campaign\u2019s analysis \n \n Cain campaign\u2019s revenue estimates \n \n Follow the Fact Checker on Twitter and friend us on Facebook \n \n Read more on PostPolitics.com \n \n The Fix: Why Herman Cain can win \n \n Romney seen as the \u2018inevitable candidate\u2019 \n \n Obama plays defense on jobs bill with Senate Democrats",

The plan would replace the tax code with a 9% corporate tax, 9% income tax and 9% federal sales tax, which would amount to a big tax cut for the wealthy, who spend little of their income, but a big tax increase for most other families, since it eliminates the deductions they rely on. \u201cJust like it would be wrong to claim pizza is a low-calorie meal, Cain\u2019s description of the plan\u2019s impact on working Americans is highly misleading,\u201d Kessler concludes.

General Assembly, President Obama held 13 one-on-one meetings with major leaders. \n \n But this year diplomacy is taking a back seat to campaigning, despite a worsening civil war in Syria, rising tensions between Israel and Iran, and the recent attack in Libya. \n \n In the president's absence, it was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton who met with Libya's president Monday, as well as the presidents of Afghanistan and Pakistan. \n \n \"The president and the Libyan government have been staunch partners to the United States,\" Clinton said. \n \n White House spokesman Jay Carney pointed out Mr. Obama is hosting two receptions for world leaders tonight, and speaks with them on the phone all the time. \n \n \"The fact of the matter is, the president does not wait for an annual meeting to have consultations with or meetings with foreign leaders, and they will continue,\" Carney said. \n \n The president will lay out a set of priorities for the U.N. General Assembly in a speech Tuesday morning, but he flies back to Washington a few hours later and then makes a campaign trip to Ohio on Wednesday. ||||| NEW YORK\u2014President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama bantered playfully and held hands Monday during a taping of the female-oriented talk show, \"The View,\" giving no indication of second thoughts about the appearance despite criticism that the president was blowing off international diplomacy in order to take part in the often-fluffy daytime gabfest. \n \n \"I told folks I'm just supposed to be eye candy here for you guys,\" President Obama said during a back-and-forth about him being the only man on the program. The show's five co-hosts are women. \n \n The first lady played along by letting the audience in\u2014just a tad\u2014on their relationship and even some of their marital spats. \n \n \"He's very loving, he's very giving. He's very open. He's funny; I'm funnier,\" Mrs. Obama said when asked to describe her husband's personality. \n \n Asked whether her husband ever gets angry, she replied: \"Yeah, yeah, he does. I can make him mad -- any number of ways.\" \n \n \"By being thoroughly unreasonable,\" the president jumped in, smiling, according to a pool report. \n \n The Obamas also talked about their 20th wedding anniversary falling on Oct. 3\u2014the night of the first presidential debate. President Obama said the couple will celebrate the following Saturday. \n \n \"I like lavishing her with all kinds of attention when she deserves it, and she always deserves it,\" the president said. \n \n President Obama also said the couple's daughters, Malia and Sasha, are becoming more independent and no longer seem eager to hang out with their father. \n \n \"They're now at the point where, they still love their daddy, but they come in [to visit him] strategically. They're not being surly or anything,\" Obama said, while adding that the children now pay about a five-minute visit and then take off. \n \n \"The View\" program the Obamas taped Monday is set to air Tuesday, taking the first couple in front of a politically-coveted heavily-female audience six weeks before the November election. \n \n Read more about: Michelle Obama, 2012 Presidential Campaign, The View ||||| President Obama on Monday flew up to New York from Washington, rode in his motorcade to ABC\u2019s studios and sat down for an interview on \u201cThe View.\u201d Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton was not far away, in the Waldorf-Astoria, meeting with President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. \n \n As dozens of world leaders gathered for the annual opening of the United Nations General Assembly \u2014 choking Manhattan\u2019s streets with motorcades and barricades \u2014 the contrast between Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton could not have been starker. \n \n Mr. Obama, his re-election campaign in full swing, continued to make his pitch to American voters, avoiding for the most part world leaders arriving at the United Nations. The president will address the General Assembly on Tuesday but, breaking with tradition, has no meetings set with his counterparts. \n \n That task he delegated to Mrs. Clinton, who churned through the first of dozens of meetings she will have over the next week. They deal with some of the most pressing foreign policy crises the administration has faced since taking office in 2009, like the deadly protests in the Islamic world and the confrontation between Japan and China over a handful of unpopulated islands. \n \n Mrs. Clinton met President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan (\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult time for all of us,\u201d he told her after riots protesting a video made in the United States that denigrates the Prophet Muhammad) as well as Mr. Karzai. By the end of a 12-hour day, she had also met with President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt, with whom she discussed issues including the security of the American Embassy in Cairo, relations with Israel and Egypt\u2019s economy. \n \n The meeting seemed to repair possible hard feelings over President Obama\u2019s recent refusal to call Egypt either a friend or an enemy despite decades of close ties. \u201cWe moved past that,\u201d a senior administration official said late Monday night. \n \n Earlier, another administration official said much the same thing about Pakistan, describing Mrs. Clinton\u2019s meeting with Mr. Zardari and Pakistan\u2019s foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar, as representing a \u201cre-energized dialogue at the highest levels\u201d \u2014 if not the very highest level, with Mr. Obama. \n \n In between, Mrs. Clinton held an emotional meeting with President Mohamed Magariaf of Libya, who reiterated his apologies for the Sept. 11 killings of Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans in Benghazi. He noted the counterprotests, held in Benghazi and other Libyan cities on Friday, that expressed support for the United States. \n \n \u201cMadam Secretary,\u201d he said, speaking softly in a conference room at the American suite in the Waldorf-Astoria, \u201cI also seize this opportunity to reaffirm that what happened on 11th of September towards these U.S. citizens does not express in any way the conscience of the Libyan people, their aspirations, their hopes or their sentiments towards the American people.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, Mr. Obama was filming a segment for \u201cThe View,\u201d the talk show hosted by Whoopi Goldberg and a quartet of sharp-tongued television celebrities. Mr. Obama arrived on the set with a basket of gifts, including home-brewed White House beer for the co-host Barbara Walters, whose birthday is Tuesday. \n \n With his wife, Michelle Obama, by his side, the president was quipping with the six women in no time: \u201cI told folks I\u2019m just supposed to be eye candy here for you guys.\u201d He chatted about not-so-weighty topics like the first couple\u2019s 20th wedding anniversary on Oct. 3, the night of the first presidential debate with Mitt Romney. \n \n Mr. Obama said he had wisely decided to celebrate with his wife the following Saturday. \n \n A moment of foreign policy gravitas occurred when Mr. Obama, asked whether the attack in Libya was an act of terrorism, said: \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the kind of weapons that were used, the ongoing assault, that it wasn\u2019t just a mob action.\u201d In what may have been a preview of his General Assembly speech, he added: \u201cThe overwhelming majority of Muslims, they want the same things that families here want. They want opportunity, kids want an education, they want jobs, they want peace. But there are extremist strains that are there.\u201d \n \n White House aides, who have been getting an earful for the past few days about the president\u2019s light schedule, sought to focus attention on Mr. Obama\u2019s speech on Tuesday. Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, told reporters that Mr. Obama would address anti-American protests that have been unfolding in the Arab world. \n \n \u201cI would expect the president to address the recent unrest in the Muslim world and the broader context of the democratic transitions of the Arab world,\u201d Mr. Carney said. \n \n He added that the speech would also give Mr. Obama another opportunity \u201cto underscore that Iran must not be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon.\u201d \n \n Mr. Obama was scheduled to attend a reception for world leaders at the United Nations on Monday night. But a campaign adviser acknowledged privately that in this election year, campaigning trumped meetings with world leaders. \u201cLook, if he met with one leader, he would have to meet with 10,\u201d the aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ||||| Bloomberg View columnist William Cohan and Democratic strategist Julian Epstein discuss why Mitt Romney is still fumbling for answers over his 2011 tax return \u2013 despite their Friday release \u2013 and whether he\u2019ll ever be able to explain how he pays for his proposed, across-the-board tax cuts. \n \n DENVER -- Mitt Romney today attempted to shift focus to what he called President Barack Obama's lack of leadership in the Middle East, as world leaders began to gather in New York City for the opening of the United Nations General Assembly. \n \n The Romney campaign this afternoon offered a series of interviews with major U.S. TV networks, in which Romney hammered Obama for referring to a series of flare-ups in the Middle East as \"bumps in the road.\" \n \n In Colorado, Mitt Romney insisted to NBC News that he'll win. The Obama campaign, meanwhile, has unveiled a new TV ad tying Romney's tax returns with his comments about the 47 percent. NBC's Chuck Todd reports. \n \n \"When the president was speaking about 'bumps in the road' he was talking about the developments in the Middle East, and that includes an assassination. It includes a Muslim Brotherhood individual becoming president of Egypt. It includes Syria being in tumult,\" Romney told NBC's Peter Alexander. \"It includes Iran being on the cusp of nuclear capability. It includes Pakistan being in commotion.\" \n \n Mitt Romney will stump in Colorado on Monday and then travel to Ohio via bus tour all ahead of next week's first debate. The Daily Rundown's Chuck Todd reports. \n \n Romney continued, \"There are extraordinary events going on in the Middle East, and considering those events, either one of them or all of them collectively, as bumps in the road shows a person who has a very different perspective about world affairs than the perspective I have. I think this is a time for America to exert leadership and this is not something that we are doing in the Middle East ... .\" \n \n Romney was referring to an answer Obama gave in an interview which aired last night on CBS News' \"60 Minutes,\" in which the president defended his support for emerging governments in the Middle East as a result of the Arab spring. \n \n Charles Dharapak / AP Republican presidential candidate, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney boards his plane in Denver, Monday, Sept. 24, 2012. \n \n Kroft: Have the events that took place in the Middle East, the recent events in the Middle East given you any pause about your support for the governments that have come to power following the Arab Spring? \n \n Obama: Well, I'd said even at the time that this is going to be a rocky path. The question presumes that somehow we could have stopped this wave of change. I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to do to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights, a notion that people have to be able to participate in their own governance. But I was pretty certain and continue to be pretty certain that there are going to be bumps in the road because, you know, in a lot of these places, the one organizing principle has been Islam. The one part of society that hasn't been controlled completely by the government. There are strains of extremism, and anti-Americanism, and anti-Western sentiment. And, you know, can be tapped into by demagogues. There will probably be some times where we bump up against some of these countries and have strong disagreements, but I do think that over the long term we are more likely to get a Middle East and North Africa that is more peaceful, more prosperous and more aligned with our interests. \n \n The Romney campaign seized on those comments -- in an attempt to chip away at the president's approval rating on foreign affairs, which slid in the last NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll to 49 percent. \n \n (However, a series of NBC/WSJ/Marist polls in the battleground states of Colorado, Iowa, and Wisconsin show Obama enjoying a double-digit lead over Romney when it comes to who would better handle foreign policy.) \n \n NBC's Peter Alexander spoke with Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney in Denver about the upcoming debates, world affairs, and if it is possible to change the tone in Washington. \n \n The Obama White House fired back on Romney, arguing that it was \"offensive\" to suggest that the president was minimizing the deaths of four Americans in Libya, including the U.S. ambassador there. \n \n \"That assertion is both desperate and offensive,\" White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said. \"The president was referring to the transformations in the region, to this process that has -- only began less than two years ago, as we saw in Tunisia, and continues to this day, with remarkable transformations occurring in countries around the region.\" \n \n Also in the interview, NBC's Alexander pressed Romney on the current polling that shows him trailing Obama. \n \n Romney remained defiant. \n \n \"I'm very pleased with the fact that we have a campaign that is taking our message to the people across America, and look --- we're gonna win,\" Romney said. \"There is no question in my mind. We're gonna win.\" \n \n NBC's Jordan Frasier contributed to this article.",

Obama shrugged off possible criticisms that he should be attending to international diplomacy with world leaders gathered for the annual opening of the UN General Assembly in New York instead of showing up on The View. \"I told folks I'm just supposed to be eye candy here for you guys,\" Obama quipped to the five female co-hosts.

Someone no doubt making him mad for real was Mitt Romney, who hammered Obama yesterday on the Mideast, particularly on his handling of the lethal attack on the US consulate in Libya earlier this month. \"These are not bumps in the road; these are human lives,\u201d Romney said yesterday in Colorado, referring to the president's own words concerning problems in the region. \u201cThis is time for a president who will shape events in the Middle East.\" White House press secretary Jay Carney called the attacks \u201cdesperate\u201d and \u201coffensive\u201d attempts by Romney in a race he's losing.

    "input": "\n \n By Andy Blatchford, THE CANADIAN PRESS \n \n \n \n \n \n MONT-TREMBLANT, Que.--Richard Henry Bain left Montreal a couple of years ago to set up a fishing lodge in the mountains north of the city and dreams of expanding his business were apparently delayed by bureaucratic roadblocks. \n \n Hours before gunshots rang out at a Parti Quebecois rally on Tuesday, Bain had been sent a note informing him that his request for an ice-fishing licence at his lodge had been put off. \n \n Bain is known locally as the friendly Scottish guy who occasionally wears a kilt. He has had his picture in the paper standing next to Celine Dion. He's the generous neighbour who shares a freshly caught trout and drives passengers around in his military vehicle decorated with Mickey Mouse decals. \n \n The locals are now shocked by news that has made international headlines. \n \n Police sources confirmed they arrested a suspect by that name in the Montreal shooting that left one person dead and made headlines around the world. \n \n The suspect in Tuesday's attack was wearing a housecoat and black facemask when he was tackled by police. He shouted about an awakening of English-speaking Quebecers as he was whisked away. \n \n A hospital statement said Wednesday a man in police custody was undergoing an evaluation. Police said there could be charges laid in the case Thursday. \n \n A Facebook page says a Richard Henry Bain runs a riverside lodge near Mont-Tremblant, Que. A website for the business was taken down Wednesday. \n \n Bain, 62, was in constant contact with officials at the local municipality, La Conception, over the past several months as he tried to expand his business, according to the village manager. \n \n He had applied to add licences for hunting and ice fishing at the lodge, Marie-France Brisson said in an interview. \n \n The village received a copy of a letter addressed to Bain from a biologist conducting an environmental assessment. \n \n It said the ice-fishing licence needed further study before being approved. \n \n The village received its copy Tuesday -- hours before the shooting. Brisson said Bain may have received the letter the same day. \n \n \"He was a man that was calm and polite who could also be frank,\" Brisson said. \n \n \"He could sometimes be frustrated (with the bureaucratic process).\" \n \n There is no evidence of any link between the man's business interests and the shooting. \n \n Neighbours who live across the highway from the entrance to Bain's property couldn't believe the friendly, generous man they know as \"Rick\" or \"Scottish\" could be linked to such an incident. \n \n Bain, who was occasionally seen wearing a kilt, would sometimes down beers with locals in the rural mountainous area close to the popular Mont-Tremblant park. \n \n He wasn't all business, all the time. \n \n A photo in a local newspaper from earlier this year shows Bain, dressed in a dapper black suit and white-collared shirt, standing alongside Celine Dion in Las Vegas. \n \n The newspaper, Info du Nord Tremblant, said Bain and another man, David Bain, won VIP tickets at a local fundraising auction to see the singer last January. \n \n Several people in the area said Bain started inviting anglers to fish for trout two years ago on the sweeping property in a dense forest. \n \n His clients would park their vehicles on a grassy piece of land alongside the highway. Bain would drive them several kilometres up a bumpy trail into the backwoods aboard his three-axle military truck. \n \n Bain's imposing army truck sat on the edge of the highway Wednesday, a couple of hundred metres from a locked gate leading to the property, which is on Crown land. \n \n The olive-coloured truck catches the attention of passersby. It has Mickey Mouse decals on both doors to the cab. The image of Mickey features moose antlers instead of his trademark round mouse ears. \n \n Neighbour Real Papineau said Bain was focused on attracting more business and asked him in the spring to hand out some pamphlets publicizing the fishing camp. \n \n To return the favour, Papineau said Bain brought him a large brook trout as a thank you. \n \n \"Incredible,\" he said, shaking his head in disbelief when a reporter told him that Bain's name was linked to the killing. \n \n \"He was always in a good mood. I never heard him make any negative remarks.\" \n \n Marc-Andre Cyr, the owner of a campground near Bain's lodge, also said he was friendly and never showed any anger toward French-speaking Quebecers. \n \n Cyr said they occasionally had a beer together. They always spoke French. \n \n \"He's someone I would meet from time to time,\" he said. \"We never talked politics.\" \n \n He said he met Bain just over a year ago and that the man was new to the region. Bain joined the local chamber of commerce about a year ago. Police sources say he had relocated from Montreal. \n \n Another man, Dominic Bouffard, who works for the local paper, said Bain is a successful businessman who occasionally took out ads to promote his lodge. Bouffard said he tried hard to network with local politicians and business leaders. \n \n \"He did everything he could to meet people in the municipality, in the (Mont-Tremblant area), and everywhere,\" Bouffard said. \n \n --with files from Benjamin Shingler and Julien Arsenault. ||||| A historic Quebec election that returned the Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois to power ended in tragedy Tuesday when a gunman killed one person and wounded another, then tried to start a fire at the Montreal venue where PQ Leader Pauline Marois was celebrating her minority mandate. \n \n Police said a suspect entered a vestibule at the back of the Metropolis nightclub and fired shots, wounding two people critically. The suspect then started a fire and ran away on foot. \n \n One shooting victim, a 45-year-old man, died at the scene. At a 6 a.m. press conference Wednesday, Montreal police said the second shooting victim, 27, was no longer in danger. Ambulance services reported another person is in hospital suffering from shock. \n \n Montreal police spokesmen said they have arrested a 62-year-old man from Quebec, but not Montreal, who spoke French with an accent. The suspect has not been identified. Police have opened a homicide investigation and have seized two firearms. Suret\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec spokesman Guy Lapointe says police cannot rule out that Ms. Marois was the intended target. \n \n \u201cThe English are waking up, the English are waking up ... It's payback ... Yeah, yeah, that\u2019s enough,\u201d the man said as police officers led him away in handcuffs. The suspect, a heavyset, bespectacled man, wore a balaclava, shorts and what appeared to be a bathrobe. \n \n [Editor's note: Comments were originally open on this story. However we have now closed comments for legal reasons following the arrest of a man after people were shot and a fire was set outside the PQ victory celebration. Readers can still access comments posted earlier by clicking here.] \n \n Ms. Marois was in the middle of her victory speech, after narrowly defeating Jean Charest\u2019s Liberals by a handful of seats and about one percentage point in the popular vote, when several plainclothes police officers from her security detail suddenly burst on stage and pulled her away, shouting \"Go with us, madam!\" She later returned and spoke to the crowd. \n \n Earlier, Ms. Marois had acknowledged the ambivalence of Quebec voters in giving her a narrow minority mandate. \n \n \"We will respect that choice by governing with all the other elected lawmakers. We'll make the necessary compromises to make the state work ... We'll govern in a responsible way.\" \n \n Ms. Marois, who had been severely criticized for campaigning on identity and language themes, had some conciliatory words for Quebec's anglophone and native communities, speaking of their shared history and, in a rare move for her, speaking in English to say their rights would be respected. \n \n However, she struck a tougher stance towards the rest of Canada. \n \n \"As a nation, we want to take ourselves the decisions that affect us. We want a country. And we'll have it.\" \n \n Liberal Leader Jean Charest, the outgoing premier, lost in his riding, for the first time in a 28-year career that began when he was elected to Parliament on this day in 1984. \n \n \"The results of this election speaks to the fact the future of Quebec lies within Canada,\" he said. He also quipped that, \"I want to thank the activists of the Liberal party who once again proved the polls wrong.\" \n \n In his concession speech, Mr. Charest boasted that his party \"will leave the house in good order.\" \n \n Mr. Charest predicted that the Liberals would bounce back. Pointing an index up, he noted that there was \"one percentage point in the popular vote between us (and the PQ).\" \n \n He made no comments about his political future. A press conference is scheduled for Wednesday. \n \n In a statement issued early Wednesday by Prime Minister Stephen Harper\u2019s office, he said: \u201cWe are disturbed by this violence and our thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones.\u201d \n \n Earlier, Mr. Harper congratulated Ms. Marois \u2014 then delivered a pointed barb aimed at the independence project. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe Quebeckers want to reopen the old constitutional quarrels of the past,\u201d he said in a statement. \n \n \u201cOur government will remain focused on jobs, economic growth and good economic management. We believe economic issues and jobs are also the priority of Quebeckers. In that sense, we will continue working with the Government of Quebec on those common objectives.\u201d \n \n Report Typo/Error",

Insurance.com reviewed insurance claim and traffic violation data from 331 models and more than 323,000 recent customers. While the most frequently ticketed vehicles include a variety of economy and luxury cars, the cars with the lowest percentage of tickets are generally more expensive vehicles, such as the Buick Encore (3%), Lexus IS350 (3%), Acura ILX (6%) and Cadillac ATS (6%). \u201cIt\u2019s the driver that gets tickets, not the car,\u201d says Penny Gusner, consumer analyst for Insurance.com. \u201cBut it is interesting to see what vehicle makes and models attract drivers who are prone to traffic violations.\u201d \n \n Cars with the most tickets: No. 1 #1.

When her apartment building burned down, the singer, now 32, lived briefly in her car before giving up and slinking back to Texas. Her life changed when she heard about an audition for a new singing competition reality TV show called American Idol in 2002. \n \n Hilary Swank \n \n \n \n Getty Images \n \n There\u2019s a reason two-time Academy Award winner Hilary Swank gravitates toward underdog roles. Swank, now 40, grew up in a trailer park in Washington. After her father left the family, teenage Swank and her mother Judy took off for Los Angeles, living out of an Oldsmobile so Swank could audition for parts. After a few early breaks, Swank landed the role of murdered transgender teen Brandon Teena in the film Boys Don\u2019t Cry, for which she won her first Oscar. \"My background is not something I forget,\" Swank has said. \"It helps me to not take what I have for granted.\" \n \n VIDEO: How Cristela Alonzo Went from Homeless to Primetime \n \n \n \n Drew Carey \n \n \n \n Getty Images \n \n Before he was the star of The Drew Carey Show and the host of The Price Is Right, Carey, 56, was just a comedian in Cleveland trying to get booked on The Tonight Show, whose host Johnny Carson was known for making comedians\u2019 careers. Carey headed west to Los Angeles where he lived in his car for a year and a half until he got the call from producers. The set went well: Carson laughed like crazy, invited Carey over to the couch to chat, and the rest is history. \n \n \n \n Sam Worthington \n \n \n \n Getty Images \n \n Just before wowing audiences in Avatar and Clash of the Titans, the Australian star was unemployed and out of work. \"Sold everything I owned and was just living in the car basically, not doing much,\" he told an interviewer. An audition with director James Cameron changed his life, and Worthington, 38, ditched the car for proper digs. The actor, who has a newborn son with Aussie model Lara Bingle last month listed his Hawaiian mansion for sale. The price? $6.5 million. \n \n Jewel \n \n Getty Images \n \n Sure, she\u2019s sold 27 million albums worldwide, but the folky singer and reality show judge, who scored a huge hit with 1995\u2019s \"Who Will Save Your Soul?,\" grew up in a house in Alaska without plumbing. At age 18, the singer lived in her car for a year, driving from city to city to play gigs before landing a record deal. \"Money will not make you happy, but it takes away a lot of stress,\" she\u2019s said. \"To this day, the things I love the most are having a place to live, never worrying about my electrical bills, being able to buy the groceries I want to buy, and being able to pay the doctors.\" \n \n VIDEO: Miley Cyrus Uses VMAs to Raise Awareness About Homeless Youth \n \n \n \n Tyler Perry \n \n \n \n Getty Images \n \n Actor and director Perry is a Hollywood empire unto himself, but life wasn\u2019t always so easy. Perry, now 45, spent every penny he had trying to stage his landmark musical I Know I\u2019ve Been Changed, which forced him to be homeless for six years, some of which Perry spent living in his car. \n \n \"Can you imagine a six-foot-five man sleeping in a Geo Metro?\" he told Essence magazine. \n \n \n \n Suze Orman \n \n \n \n Getty Images \n \n Her financial house is in order now (and she\u2019d like yours to be, too!), but even money guru Orman had a rough beginning. On her personal website, Orman, now 63, recalls dropping out of college and borrowing money from her brother to buy a Ford Econoline van, which she and friends lived in as they drove across the country. After years of waiting tables, Orman\u2019s life changed when a friendly customer took pity on the broke young woman and handed her a check for $2,000 with instructions on how to invest it. \n \n \n \n Steve Harvey \n \n \n \n Getty Images \n \n The television personality and author is on top of the world these days, but Harvey, now 58, remembers the three years he spent homeless when he was trying to crack the comedy circuit in the late 1980s. Money dried up. \"I had nowhere to go,\" Harvey told People, so he began living in his 1976 Ford Tempo, using an Igloo cooler as a refrigerator. \u201cIt was rock bottom,\u201d he recalled. \"But even in my darkest days I had faith it would turn around.\" A call to appear on Showtime at the Apollo was his lucky break. \n \n WATCH: Chris Pratt Moved Out of His Van After Landing a $700 Movie Role!",

(Associated Press) \n \n A statement from the body, the Investigative Committee, didn't address the possibility seen as likely by many of Nemtsov's supporters \u2014 that he was killed for being one of President Vladimir Putin's most adamant and visible critics. \n \n The 55-year-old Nemtsov was gunned down Friday near midnight as he walked on a bridge near the Kremlin with a female companion. The killing came just a few hours after a radio interview in which he denounced Putin's \"mad, aggressive\" policies and the day before he was to help lead a rally protesting Russia's actions in the Ukraine crisis and the economic crisis at home. \n \n After his death, organizers canceled the rally and instead called for a demonstration to mourn him on Sunday in central Moscow. The city gave quick approval for that gathering, in contrast to its usual slow and grudging permission for opposition rallies. \n \n The Investigative Committee said it was looking into whether Nemtsov had been killed as a \"sacrificial victim for those who do not shun any method for achieving their political goals,\" a suggestion echoing the comments by Putin's spokesman and other Russian politicians that the attack was a \"provocation\" against the state. \n \n It also said it was considering whether there was \"personal enmity\" toward him in his domestic life. State-controlled TV and Kremlin-friendly media outlets on Saturday gave considerable attention to Nemtsov's companion, identifying her as a Ukrainian model 30 years his junior and showing photos of her in alluring poses. The Investigative Committee said the pair were headed for Nemtsov's apartment. \n \n The statement also said it was investigating whether the killing was connected to the Ukraine conflict, where Russia-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since last April, or whether there was a connection to Islamic extremism. \n \n Nemtsov had been one of Putin's most visible critics and his death hit other members of the opposition hard. The mourning march on Sunday could serve to galvanize the beleaguered and marginalized opposition, or it could prove to be a brief catharsis after which emotions dissipate. \n \n Through the morning, hundreds of people came to the site of Nemtsov's death to lay flowers. \n \n Nemtsov was working on a report presenting evidence that he believed proved Russia's direct involvement in the separatist rebellion that has raged in eastern Ukraine since April. Moscow denies backing the rebels with troops and sophisticated weapons. \n \n Putin ordered Russia's top law enforcement chiefs to personally oversee the investigation of Nemtsov's killing. \n \n \"Putin noted that this cruel murder has all the makings of a contract hit and is extremely provocative,\" presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in remarks carried by Russian news agencies. \n \n Ramzan Kadyrov, the Putin-backed leader of Chechnya, raised the suggestion into an accusation. \n \n \"There's no doubt that Nemtsov's killing was organized by Western special services, trying by any means to create internal conflict in Russia,\" he said on Instagram. \n \n President Barack Obama said the Russian people \"lost one of the most dedicated and eloquent defenders of their rights.\" \n \n German Chancellor Angela Merkel praised Nemtsov's courage in criticizing Kremlin policies, and urged Putin to insure that the killers are brought to justice, her spokesman Steffen Seibert said. \n \n Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev echoed the suggestion that the killing was a provocation. \"It's an attempt to push the situation into complications, maybe even to destabilizing the situation in the country,\" he was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. \n \n Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov agreed. \"It's a provocation; for big fires, sacrificial figures are necessary,\" Interfax quoted him as saying. \n \n Nemtsov frequently assailed the government's inefficiency, rampant corruption and Ukraine policy. \n \n In an interview with the Sobesednik newspaper, Nemtsov said earlier this month that his 86-year old mother was afraid that Putin could have him killed. Asked if he had such fears himself, he responded: \"If I were afraid I wouldn't have led an opposition party.\" \n \n Speaking on radio just a few hours before his death, he accused Putin of plunging Russia into crisis by his \"mad, aggressive and deadly policy of war against Ukraine.\" \n \n Kasyanov, the former prime minister, said he was shocked. \n \n \"In the 21st century, a leader of the opposition is being demonstratively shot just outside the walls of the Kremlin!\". \n \n \"This is a monstrous tragedy and a loss for us all,\" Alexei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition figure, said on his Facebook page. He is currently on a 15-day jail sentence for handing out leaflets without authorization. \n \n \"The country is rolling into the abyss,\" Kasyanov, the former prime minister, told reporters as Nemtsov's body, placed in a plastic bag, was removed on a rainy and cold night, as the Kremlin bells chimed nearby. \n \n Nemtsov served as a regional governor and then a deputy prime minister in the 1990s and once was seen as a possible successor to Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first elected president. \n \n Nemtsov was widely liked for his good humor, larger-than-life character and quick wit, but he and other top opposition figures long have been purged from state television and steadily marginalized by the Kremlin. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Vladimir Isachenkov and Laura Mills in Moscow and Jake Pearson in New York contributed to this report. ||||| \u201cI love Russia and want the best for her, so for me criticizing Putin is a very patriotic activity because these people are leading Russia to ruin,\u201d Mr. Nemtsov said in an interview in 2011, republished Saturday on the Meduza news site. \u201cEverybody who supports them in fact supports a regime that is destroying the country, and so they are the ones who hate Russia. And those who criticize this regime, those who fight against it, they are the patriots.\u201d \n \n In recent years, Mr. Nemtsov\u2019s star had been eclipsed by Aleksei A. Navalny, the anticorruption blogger who played a leading role in the 2011 protests. But Mr. Nemtsov remained active and was a leading organizer of this weekend\u2019s planned rally. \n \n Mr. Nemtsov was organizing the rally in part because Mr. Navalny is currently serving a two-week jail sentence for handing out leaflets on the subway. The rally was also noteworthy because it was the first political action inside Russia specifically endorsed by Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky, the exiled former political prisoner, who had signed the petition for a parade permit. \n \n The investigative committee of the prosecutor\u2019s office said gunmen shot Mr. Nemtsov four times in the back as he walked over the bridge, and by accident or design theatrically placed his body on the wet asphalt with the Kremlin visible behind. No suspects have been reported to be in custody. \n \n While such contract street killings were commonplace in Moscow in the 1990s, the violence had dwindled under Mr. Putin, making the killing of Mr. Nemtsov all the more shocking. He is by far the most prominent public figure to die in such a fashion, though just one in a string of murders of opponents of Mr. Putin, most notoriously the journalist Anna Politkovskaya, the human rights researcher Natalia Estemirova and the security service defector Aleksandr V. Litvinenko. And while low-level criminals have been detained in some cases, the investigations in Russia never traced back to those who ordered the murders. \n \n The Interfax news agency cited an unnamed security service operative as saying the murder was a \u201cprovocation,\u201d coming as it did just days before the opposition march. ||||| Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko addresses the commemoration for people from the so-called ''Heavenly Sotnya'' (Hundred), who were killed in anti-government protests in 2014, at Independence Square in Kiev February 20, 2015. \n \n (This refiled version of the story corrects spelling error in second paragraph) \n \n KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said on Saturday Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov was murdered because he planned to disclose evidence of Russia's involvement in Ukraine's separatist conflict. \n \n Poroshenko paid tribute to Nemtsov, who was shot dead late on Friday, and said the fierce critic of President Vladimir Putin had told him a couple of weeks ago that he had proof of Russia's role in the Ukraine crisis and would reveal it. \n \n \"He said he would reveal persuasive evidence of the involvement of Russian armed forces in Ukraine. Someone was very afraid of this ... They killed him,\" Poroshenko said in televised comments during a visit to the city of Vinnytsia. \n \n More than 5,600 people have been killed since pro-Russian separatists rebelled in east Ukraine last April, after the ousting of a Moscow-backed president in Kiev and Russia's annexation of the Crimea peninsula. \n \n Kiev and its Western allies say the rebels are funded and armed by Moscow, and backed by Russian military units. Moscow denies aiding sympathisers in Ukraine, and says heavily armed Russian-speaking troops operating without insignia there are not its men. \n \n (Reporting by Alessandra Prentice and Polina Devitt,; Additional reporting by Margarita Chornokondratenko,; Editing by Alexander Winning and Timothy Heritage)",

They killed him.\" Russian investigators, meanwhile, said they were looking at a range of motives, including the idea that enemies of Putin killed Nemtsov \"as a provocation to destabilize the political situation in the country,\" reports the New York Times. They also made a point to say they would look into his personal life, and state TV emphasized that the 55-year-old was walking with a much younger model when he was shot to death, reports AP.

    "input": "A wonky beast about the size of a Labrador retriever with a long neck and lengthy tail may be the world's earliest known dinosaur, say researchers who analyzed fossilized bones discovered in Tanzania in the 1930s. \n \n Now named Nyasasaurus parringtoni, the dinosaur would've walked a different Earth from today. It lived between 240 million and 245 million years ago when the planet's continents were still stitched together to form the landmass Pangaea. Tanzania would've been part of the southern end of Pangaea that also included Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia. \n \n It likely stood upright, measuring 7 to 10 feet (2 to 3 meters) in length, 3 feet (1 m) at the hip, and may have weighed between 45 and 135 pounds (20 to 60 kilograms). \n \n \"If the newly named Nyasasaurus parringtoni is not the earliest dinosaur, then it is the closest relative found so far,\" said lead researcher Sterling Nesbitt, a postdoctoral biology researcher at the University of Washington. \n \n The findings, detailed online Dec. 5 in the journal Biology Letters, push the dinosaur lineage back 10 million to 15 million years than previously known, all the way into the Middle Triassic, which lasted from about 245 million to 228 million years ago. [See Photos of the Oldest Dinosaur Fossils] \n \n Dating a dinosaur \n \n The study is based on seemingly few bones \u2014 a humerus or upper arm bone and six vertebrae \u2014 though Nesbitt pointed out much of what we know about dinosaurs comes from similar number of fossils. Only a rare few dinosaurs are excavated with near-complete skeletons, a la museum centerpieces. \n \n For their study, the researchers had to determine whether the bones indeed belonged to a dinosaur and how long ago the beast would've lived. \n \n They dated the fossils based on the layer of rock in which it was found and the ages for the layers above and below it (over time layers of sediment accumulate on top of remains, making a vertical slice somewhat of a timeline into the past). \n \n They also looked at the ages of rock layers with similar animal remains found across the globe. \n \n As for whether the beast is a dinosaur, several clues say it is. For instance, dinosaurs grew quickly, and a cross-section of the humerus suggests bone tissue was laid down in a haphazard way, a telltale sign of rapid growth. \n \n \"We can tell from the bone tissues that Nyasasaurus had a lot of bone cells and blood vessels,\" said co-author Sarah Werning of the University of California, Berkeley, who did the bone analysis. \"In living animals, we only see this many bone cells and blood vessels in animals that grow quickly, like some mammals or birds,\" Werning said in a statement. \n \n The patterns in this bone scan indicate that the bone fibers are disorganized, like those of other early dinosaurs. Credit: \u00a9Natural History Museum \n \n The upper arm bone also sported a distinctively enlarged crest that would've served as a place of attachment for arm muscles. \n \n \"It's kind of your shoulder muscle or the equivalent in a dinosaur,\" Nesbitt told LiveScience, adding that \"early dinosaurs are the only group to have this feature.\" \n \n Vertebrate paleontologist and geologist Hans-Dieter Sues, who was not involved in the study, agrees with the dating and dinosaur tag placed on the remains. \"I first saw the bones in the 1970s when the late Alan Charig (one of the co-authors) showed them to me,\" Sues, of the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., told LiveScience in an email. At that time none of his colleagues would accept that dinosaurs had appeared so early in geological history.\" \n \n Sues added that additional, more complete remains are needed to confirm the relationships between Nyasasaurus and other dinosaurs. [6 Weird Species Discovered in Museums] \n \n Answering a long-standing question \n \n Paleontologists have for about 150 years suggested dinosaurs existed in the Middle Triassic, as the oldest dinosaur fossils fit into the Late Triassic period. However, that evidence has been fraught with uncertainty, with conclusions based on only dinosaurlike footprints or very fragmentary fossils. Footprints can be tricky to interpret, in this case, because other animals roaming Earth at the time would've made similar pedal prints. \n \n \"Previous to this find, all the oldest dinosaurs were all equally old from the same place in Argentina, and those sediments are about 230 million years [old]. So this pushes the dinosaur lineage or the closest relative to dinosaurs all the way back to the Middle Triassic,\" Nesbitt said during a telephone interview. \"This is our best evidence of a Middle Triassic dinosaur.\" \n \n In addition to pushing back the timeline for dinosaurs, Nesbitt says the study also reveals how dinosaurs emerged on Earth. Rather than waking up on the planet as the dominant beasts during their heydays in the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods, dinosaurs gradually ramped up to their reign. \n \n \"They were a unique group, but they didn't evolve and take over terrestrial ecosystems immediately,\" Nesbitt said. \"Most of what we see in museums are from the Jurassic and Cretaceous when they did dominate \u2014 at their origins they were just a part of the radiation of Archosaurs,\" or the dominant land animals during the Triassic period that included dinosaurs, crocodiles and their relatives. \n \n Nesbitt hopes the discovery will encourage other paleontologists digging in Middle Triassic rocks to keep a lookout for dinosaurs \u2014 fossils, that is. \n \n Follow LiveScience on Twitter @livescience. We're also on Facebook & Google+. ||||| Image caption Nyasasaurus parringtoni would have shared the land with silesaurs, identified as dinosaurs' closest relatives \n \n Palaeontologists have found what is likely to be the oldest known dinosaur, filling in a yawning evolutionary gap. \n \n A study in Biology Letters describes Nyasasaurus parringtoni, a new species from 10-15 million years before the previous earliest dinosaur specimens. \n \n It walked on two legs, measured 2-3m in length with a large tail and weighed between 20 and 60kg. \n \n The find suggests that many millions of years passed between dinosaurs' first members and their dominance on land. \n \n \"It fills a gap between what we previously knew to be the oldest dinosaurs and their other closest relatives,\" report co-author Paul Barrett, of the Natural History Museum in London, told BBC News. \n \n Image caption The find shores up the idea that dinosaurs evolved on the southern parts of the supercontinent Pangaea \n \n \"There was this big gap in the fossil record where dinosaurs should've been present and this fossil neatly fills that gap.\" \n \n However, the team behind the work has stopped short of definitively calling N parringtoni the earliest dinosaur, because the fossil skeletons used to define it were incomplete: one upper arm bone and six vertebrae. \n \n The early evolution of dinosaurs is difficult to unpick, as a rich variety of reptiles were proliferating at the time - and some may even have independently evolved characteristics that are associated with dinosaurs. \n \n The researchers, from the University of Washington and University of California Berkeley in the US and the Natural History Museum, re-examined a number of bones that were first collected from what is now Lake Malawi in southern Africa. \n \n They saw a few features that are unambiguously those of dinosaurs - notably what is called an \"elongated deltopectoral crest\" that served as an anchor for strong pectoral muscles. \n \n Lead author of the research Sterling Nesbitt, of the University of Washington Seattle, led a team that in 2010 reported the finding of dinosaurs' oldest relative, a member of a group called the silesaurs. \n \n It now appears that those creatures shared the southern part of the supercontinent Pangaea - now South America, Africa, Antarctica and Australia - with N parringtoni. \n \n \"Those animals were the earliest of this group that led up toward dinosaurs,\" explained Dr Barrett. \"Now this takes dinosaurs back to the right kind of time when those two groups would have split apart from each other.\" \n \n As it closes that evolutionary gap, it shows that dinosaurs did not start out as dominant as they later became. \n \n \"We push the origin of dinosaurs further back in time to a time when lots of reptile groups are evolving,\" Dr Barrett said. \n \n \"Dinosaurs start out as a very insignificant group of reptiles - all relatively small animals, relatively rare in comparison with other reptile groups - and it's only a bit later in their history that they suddenly explode and take over as the dominant forms of life for nearly 100 million years.\"",

Nyasasaurus parringtoni lived between 240 million and 245 million years ago, some 10 million to 15 million years earlier than any other dinosaurs previously discovered.

There is no argument over works which were acquired by Mr Gurlitt's father before the Nazis came to power so they can go to Bern. But in between the two categories are hundreds of paintings which may be disputed. The authorities will give potential claimants a year to come forward. At the end of it all, the name Gurlitt may be remembered in some title like the Gurlitt Bequest at the museum in Bern. It would be a bland title belying a tragic human story. \n \n The Bern Art Museum said that it was delighted at the news that it had been made Mr Gurlitt's \"unrestricted and unfettered sole heir\", but added that the bequest also posed some questions. \n \n \"The Board of Trustees and directors of Kunstmuseum Bern are surprised and delighted, but at the same time do not wish to conceal the fact that this magnificent bequest brings with it a considerable burden of responsibility and a wealth of questions of the most difficult and sensitive kind, and questions in particular of a legal and ethical nature\", it said in a statement. \n \n Mr Gurlitt's father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, was ordered to deal in works that had been seized from Jews, or which the Nazis considered \"degenerate\" and had removed from German museums. \n \n The priceless collection was confiscated in 2012 by Bavarian authorities from the apartment of his son. \n \n Image caption A beach scene by German impressionist Max Liebermann was one of the important discoveries \n \n Image copyright AFP / CHRISTOF STACHE Image caption Matisse's Femme Assise is the subject of an ownership claim \n \n Image caption The hoard of paintings includes Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Man Seated \n \n After initially refusing to give up the paintings, Mr Gurlitt changed his position, agreeing to co-operate with the German authorities on establishing the paintings' provenance, and returning them if they were shown to be stolen. \n \n 'Wild speculation' \n \n Mr Gurlitt, who had no close relatives, wrote the will within the last few weeks shortly before undergoing heart surgery, according to his spokesman, Stephan Holzinger. \n \n \"It now falls to the probate court to determine if the will is valid and whether a contract of inheritance exists,\" he told the BBC earlier on Wednesday. \n \n \"I can understand that there is now wild speculation, but I don't want to comment on that at this stage.\" \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Stephen Evans was granted exclusive access to look at some of the long-lost masterpieces \n \n The German government said earlier that the collector's death would not affect the investigation into ownerships claims on the paintings. \n \n Mr Gurlitt's collection only came to light after a routine check found he was carrying wads of cash on a train from Switzerland, triggering a tax inquiry. \n \n Investigators found more than 1,400 works in his flat in Munich in February 2012 - though they only revealed the discovery in late 2013 - and a further 60 in his house near Salzburg, Austria, earlier this year. \n \n Among them were works by Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Marc Chagall, Emil Nolde and Max Liebermann. \n \n The collection is estimated to be worth up to a billion euros (\u00a3850m; $1.35bn). \n \n Under German law, Cornelius Gurlitt was not compelled to return any paintings because the incidents happened more than 30 years ago. ||||| Several works in his collection suspected of having been looted from Jewish families during Nazi era \n \n A Swiss museum has inherited one of the most controversial art collections in recent European history. Kunstmuseum Bern confirmed on Wednesday it has been named the \"unrestricted and unfettered sole heir\" in the will of the reclusive collector Cornelius Gurlitt, who died on Tuesday. \n \n Several works in the collection, which was originally assembled by Gurlitt's father Hildebrand, are suspected of having been looted from Jewish families during the Nazi era. A taskforce of art experts is examining the provenance of the works in a secret location in Germany until the end of the year. \n \n Kunstmuseum Bern's director, Matthias Frehner, said in a statement: that the news had come \"like a bolt from the blue\", since Gurlitt had at no time had any connection to the museum. Already boasting works by Pablo Picasso and Paul Klee, the museum could soon be showing paintings and sketches by Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Marc Chagall, Oskar Kokoschka and Max Liebermann among others. \n \n Frehner said: \"The Board of Trustees and Directors of Kunstmuseum Bern are surprised and delighted, but at the same time do not wish to conceal the fact that this magnificent bequest brings with it a considerable burden of responsibility and a wealth of questions of the most difficult and sensitive kind, and questions in particular of a legal and ethical nature.\" \n \n Chris Marinello, a London-based art recovery expert representing the descendants of the Jewish art dealer Paul Rosenberg, welcomed the news: \"We see it as a positive development that Mr Gurlitt left his collection to a museum, which is bound by international codes of ethics regarding looted artworks as well as the Washington principles on Nazi-confiscated art\". \n \n Given that one painting in Gurlitt's possession, Henri Matisse's Sitting Woman, had already been proven to be looted from Rosenberg's collection, Marinello didn't expect it to end up in Bern, he told the Guardian. ||||| MUNICH, Germany \u2013 Reclusive art collector Cornelius Gurlitt left his entire trove of works concealed for decades to the Kuntsmuseum in Bern, Switzerland, the museum said Wednesday. \n \n Gurlitt, who died on Tuesday, hoarded more than 1,000 works believed to be lost in World War II or destroyed by the Nazi regime in his apartment and in a house outside Salzburg, Austria. The collection, which was amassed by Gurlitt's father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, includes paintings and drawings by Marc Chagall, Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse. \n \n German tax authorities discovered the pieces in February 2012 in Gurlitt's apartment. \n \n Gurlitt's lawyer Christoph Edel confirmed by telephone and in writing that Gurlitt had \"appointed the private-law foundation Kuntsmuseum Bern his unrestricted and unfettered sole heir,\" the museum said in a statement. \n \n The news \"came like a bolt from the blue, since at no time has Mr. Gurlitt had any connection with Kuntsmuseum Bern,\" it said. \n \n The Nazis had labeled the avant-garde artworks as \u201cdegenerate\u201d and plundered them from museums or forced owners, many of them Jewish, to sell them for below their real prices. Hildebrand Gurlitt, an art dealer close to the Nazi regime, built up the collection that today rivals those of many of the world\u2019s modern art museums. \n \n His son then concealed them for decades. \n \n CHRISTOF STACHE / AFP - Getty Images A picture shows the building in Munich's Schwabing district where hundreds of masterpieces thought to have been stolen by the Nazis were discovered in an apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt. \n \n \u201c[Cornelius Gurlitt's] heirs can decide how to proceed with the art work, but they will have to abide by the agreement that was reached,\u201d Edel told NBC News earlier on Wednesday. \n \n He was referring to a deal struck with government last month that established a task force to research the provenance of works suspected of having been stolen by the Nazis. A website has been set up for potential claimants to see the collection. \n \n \"[Gurlitt] is committed to the voluntary return of any looted art,\" German Culture Minister Monika Gr\u00fctters said at the time. \n \n The find of nearly 1,300 paintings and drawings last fall delighted the art world, but also brought doubt about the rightful ownership and restitution claims. \n \n Matthias Henkel, director of communications for the task force appointed by the government, told NBC News that the experts were continuing in their fact-finding mission and acting on the assumption that whoever inherited the art would abide by the agreement. \n \n \u201cWe also have a moral obligation to clarify the historical circumstances,\u201d he said. \n \n German media had reported earlier that Gurlitt wanted to pass the ownership of the artworks to \u201ca foreign institution.\u201d \n \n He reportedly was upset with German authorities over the investigation and had contacts with art institutions in Austria and Switzerland, home to the Kuntsmuseum Bern. \n \n First published May 7 2014, 5:49 AM",

    "input": "It's time once again for an absurd Thanksgiving ritual. \n \n On Wednesday, the National Turkey Foundation will carry two plump male turkeys over to the White House and lift them onto a table. President Obama will give them goofy names like Caramel and Popcorn. Then Obama will \"pardon\" the turkeys and, instead of lopping off their heads and tossing them in an oven, he will let them live out the rest of their lives at the estate in Mount Vernon. \n \n To be fair, the president has to do lots of frivolous public events like this one every year. But the turkey pardon stands out as being especially dumb and worth abolishing. Here's why: \n \n -- It's not even a real tradition! The National Turkey Federation has donated two turkeys to the White House every year since 1947. Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower did the sensible thing and simply ate the birds. No pardons there. \n \n Some accounts credit John F. Kennedy with the first official turkey pardon, but like most JFK mythologizing, this is overblown sentimentality: Kennedy merely sent one of his turkeys back to the farm because it wasn't big enough. \"We'll let this one grow,\" he groused of the inadequate offering. (Others credit Abraham Lincoln, who once spared a turkey destined for Christmas dinner when his son Tad pleaded for mercy, but that clearly didn't catch on for decades.) \n \n Ronald Reagan was technically the first president to \"pardon\" a Thanksgiving turkey, in 1987 \u2014 but he did it as a joke to distract the press from scandal. Reporters had been hounding the president about whether he planned to grant pardons to key Iran-Contra figures like Oliver North and John Poindexter. Reagan merely quipped that he would have pardoned that year's turkey had it not been en route to a petting zoo already. \n \n Two years later, in 1989, Reagan's successor George H.W. Bush made the turkey pardon an annual ritual. But it all started as a glib one-liner meant to deflect attention away from White House lawbreaking. Hardly a sacred convention. \n \n -- The pardoned turkeys aren't that much better off \u2014 because the life of a turkey is misery and pain. This is going to get gruesome, and I'm sorry about that. But modern-day domestic turkeys aren't bred to have a happy life. They're raised to be as large as possible so that they can be slaughtered as soon as possible and produce the greatest volume of delicious turkey meat. \n \n Some fun facts: Turkeys bred for eating now grow to an average of 30 pounds \u2014 much bigger than wild turkeys.* (The two turkeys on their way to the White House are over 37 pounds apiece.) These domesticated turkeys are often so fat that their skeletons are unable to support that weight. They frequently develop bone deformities and degenerative joint diseases. They're incapable of breeding on their own. They often suffer heart failure or bleeding around the kidneys. \n \n So it's no coincidence that, as US News & World Report and National Journal have discovered, most pardoned turkeys die within a year of being granted a reprieve anyway. The White House wants us to believe these turkeys are living out a life of leisure on the farm and bopping along to their favorite Lady Gaga tracks. Not so: \n \n For the record, I'm not opposed to raising turkeys for food (and, yes, it's possible to get humanely raised turkeys). But it's not clear why we need an elaborate White House ceremony designed to obscure where that food actually comes from. \n \n -- It's a mockery of the presidential pardon, which is an all-too neglected issue. Maybe this isn't surprising, since the turkey pardon was basically invented as a way of mocking presidential pardons. Still, it's worth mentioning. \n \n After tomorrow, Obama will have \"pardoned\" 10 turkeys in all (turkeys that, as best we can tell, haven't actually committed any crimes). By contrast, he will have only pardoned or commuted the sentences of 40 actual living human beings. \n \n The latter is a record low for modern-day presidents. At the same point in his presidency, Ronald Reagan had pardoned 313 people. Harry Truman had pardoned 1,537 people: \n \n Last year, Sam Morrison, an official who spent 13 years in the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney before retiring in 2010, described the prevailing attitude toward pardons this way: \"They tend to view any grant of clemency not as a good thing, as a criminal justice success story, but almost as a defeat \u2014 that you're taking away something from what some good prosecutor achieved.\" (The Justice Department disputed this characterization.) \n \n Over at National Journal, Ron Fournier pointed out that, at the bare minimum, Obama could grant clemency to all the people still serving extra time in prison under the old crack-sentencing guidelines \u2014 guidelines that Obama himself opposed as excessive and which Congress reduced for all new prisoners in 2010. So far, however, there's no sign that the White House will do this. \n \n The White House does, however, have a flashy Web site up letting you vote on your favorite soon-to-be-pardoned turkey. Yes, there are hashtags. \n \n * Fixed the weight numbers. ||||| Story highlights Each year, an American president \"pardons\" a turkey or two just before Thanksgiving \n \n President Barack Obama has sent his turkeys to Mt. Vernon for their \"twilight years\" \n \n But a pardon just means the birds aren't stuffed and eaten; they're not expected to live long \n \n American turkeys are bred to be consumed, many of them at Thanksgiving \n \n Along a pastoral lane at George Washington's Mount Vernon estate sits a sizable wooden pen built specifically to house the two turkeys that will be \"pardoned\" at the White House on Wednesday. \n \n The well-appointed pen includes a small coop to protect them from weather and foxes, and an area for them to strut their stuff for camera-toting tourists. \n \n But there is one thing that is missing: other turkeys. That's because all the turkeys ever pardoned at the White House are dead, including the six already given a pass from the roasting pan by President Barack Obama in previous years. \n \n \"The bird is bred for the table, not for longevity,\" said Dean Norton, the director at Mount Vernon in charge of livestock. \"Some of [the pardoned turkeys] have been pretty short lived.\" \n \n Compared to domesticated animals, turkeys bred for consumption are usually plump and slaughtered after a period of months, and wouldn't be expected to live much longer on their own. So, a pardon really can extend their lives a lot, relatively speaking. \n \n JUST WATCHED Thanksgiving by the numbers Replay More Videos ...

MUST WATCH Funny or Die: A Very Cosby Thanksgiving 00:10 \n \n The two turkeys pardoned in 2012 - Cobbler and Gobbler - died within a year of their White House appearance, despite what a spokeswoman at Mount Vernon said was diligent veterinary care. \n \n Gobbler died on February 5, 2013, of natural causes. Cobbler lived a bit longer, dying on August 22, 2013, after he fell ill and had to be euthanized. Both are buried at Mount Vernon. \n \n In the two years prior, three of the four pardoned turkeys died less than five months after their pardon. \n \n The other turkey - Peace, who was pardoned in 2011 - lived 16 months after arriving at Mount Vernon. \n \n So why do those birds -- and others bred to be eaten -- die faster than their wild brethren? \n \n \"The birds are fed in such a way to increase their weight,\" Norton, who has worked at Mount Vernon since 1969, said. \"[Americans] want a nice big breasted turkey and so they are fed high protein diet and they get quite large. The organs, though, that are in this bird are meant for a smaller bird. They just can't handle the extra weight, so they end up living not as long [as wild turkeys].\" \n \n The differences extend beyond life expectancy, too. \n \n \"Your native bird can fly beautifully and roost in trees,\" Norton said, while the type that receive pardons \"does not fly, has very short stubbly legs and typically last right up to Thanksgiving.\" \n \n Final years? Figuratively \n \n In 2012, when Obama announced the pardons for Cobbler and Gobbler, he hinted the birds were in their final years, telling the audience that they were headed to Mount Vernon \"where they will spend their twilight years in the storied home of George Washington.\" \n \n The word \"years,\" however, seems to be an exaggeration. \n \n The National Turkey Federation, a group that lobbies for the turkey industry and selects those to be honored each year at the White House, disagrees with any notion that the lives of these birds are cut short. \n \n They are bred for consumption have a \"life expectancy of about 18 weeks,\" said Keith Williams, spokesman for the turkey federation. \"They are not raised as pets and animals are not pets.\" \n \n Their short lives, Williams points out, says more about Americans taste for turkey and breeding practices than mistreatment or short lives. \n \n Bred to be stuffed \n \n Starting in 1960, farmers specifically started breeding plump turkeys that had large amounts of white breast meat -- a response to American demand. The differences between wild and bred turkeys, Williams said, stems mostly from diet. \n \n \"A turkey that is bred exclusively for eating, eats corn and soybean that have minerals in them,\" Williams said. \n \n According to the federation, a whopping 219 million turkeys were consumed in the United States in 2011. On Thanksgiving that year, the group estimates 46 million were gobbled up. \n \n Since 1970, around the time breeding practices changed, turkey consumption has increased 104 percent, according to the federation. \n \n The practice of pardoning a turkey at the White House dates to Abraham Lincoln. \n \n The story goes that around Thanksgiving, turkeys were brought to the White House and Lincoln's son, Tad, grew attached to one particular bird and begged his chief executive father to spare the fowl from the table. Lincoln agreed and the turkey lived. \n \n It is unclear if the practice continued for the next 100 years. But in 1963, President John F. Kennedy decided to send his turkey back to the farm it came from, telling the National Turkey Federation they should \"just let this one grow\" instead. \n \n Bush \"41\" sent them to Frying Pan Park \n \n The tradition became official in 1989, under President George H.W. Bush. On November 14, weeks before Thanksgiving, Bush pardoned a turkey and the White House shipped him off to live his twilight year at -- Frying Pan Park -- in Herndon, Virginia. \n \n Since then, a President has pardoned a turkey each year. \n \n All of Obama's turkeys were sent to Mount Vernon. The birds spent the holidays in the public pen and then were moved to a livestock area out of view because they were not \"historically accurate\" to Washington's time period. \n \n According to Norton, the turkey federation wanted the birds to be more prominently displayed. So this year, they will head to Morven Park, a historic estate in Leesburg, Virginia, on January 7. \n \n The estate was home to Former Virginia Gov. Westmoreland Davis, who ran it from 1918 to 1922. Davis was a prodigious turkey farmer, according to Teresa Davenport, a spokeswoman for Morven Park. \n \n As for the near certainty that the turkeys will soon die, Davenport said they \"are going to do everything [they] can to make that not happen.\" \n \n \"These turkeys were raised in Minnesota, so they are used to cold winters,\" Davenport said. \"A lot of the employees here are already on turkey duty.\"",
    "reference": "\u2013 President Obama will \"pardon\" a pair of turkeys today and send them to live at Mount Vernon, and if that gives you a case of the warm fuzzies, you should know that both \"Caramel\" and \"Popcorn\" will probably be dead within the year. Every turkey the president has ever pardoned is dead, including the two pardoned last year, CNN points out, with one only lasting until February. In the two previous years, three of the four died in less than five months (the other held out an impressive 16 months). The reason: The birds are bred for food, not longevity. Their normal-sized internal organs can only hold up to their carefully engineered bulk for so long. A spokesman for the National Turkey Federation, the lobbying group that provides the birds, says they have \"a life expectancy of about 18 weeks. They are not raised as pets.\" It's one reason Brad Plumer at the Washington Post wants to end the pardon\u2014the others being that it mocks real presidential pardons, and isn't nearly the historic tradition it pretends to be. Of course, at this point columns decrying the pardon are becoming a tradition of their own."

He set an eye-popping new world record of 57.55sec in the men's 100m breaststroke heats -- his first ever Olympic swim. \n \n Later Hungary's Katinka Hosszu shattered the world record by more than two seconds to win the women's 4x100m individual medley. \n \n But Australia dominated the first night in the pool, first when Horton dethroned China's Sun Yang to win the men's 400m freestyle. \n \n Individual world record-holder Campbell then anchored Australia to 4x100m freestyle gold in 3min 30.65sec, the fastest time in history. \n \n \"Definitely my favorite race ever, in an Olympic final with my sister and two girls I have known since I was 12, 13 years old and a gold and a world record,\" said Campbell, who swam with Emma McKeon, Brittany Elmslie and her sister Bronte. \n \n \"You can't ask for more,\" said Bronte Campbell. \"Every kid dreams of it, it's what we always hoped for.\" \n \n The results pushed Australia to the top of the early medals table and confirmed their return to prominence in swimming, after their poor outing at London 2012. \n \n The Rio Games started with an unwanted bang when a military bomb squad detonated a suspicious package near the finish of the men's cycle race at Copacabana beach, causing jitters among onlookers. \n \n - Stray bullet - \n \n At the equestrian venue at Deodoro, which is on a military base, a stray bullet ripped through the media centre's canvas roof and landed on the floor. \n \n \"All authorities assured that the bullet was a stray bullet that has nothing to do with the Games or the Olympic family or the press. The area was not a target,\" said Games spokesman Mario Andrada. \n \n Later Hoang Xuan Vinh wrote his name in the history books when he won the men's 10m air pistol, claiming the first ever gold medal for communist Vietnam. \n \n \"It's the first gold medal in Vietnam's history, I feel very lucky,\" said the modest, 41-year-old military officer. \n \n Thailand's Sopita Tanasan won the first weightlifting gold, the women's -48kg, with a total lift of 200kg. \n \n Scandal-hit Russia, under fire over a massive doping scandal, got off the mark when Beslan Mudranov won the men's 60kg judo. \n \n Van Avermaet avoided a crash on the final descent and overhauled leader Rafal Majka with a lung-busting sprint to win the 237.5km (147.5 miles) cycle race. \n \n \"It was the hardest day I've ever had in my life on a bike,\" said Ireland's Dan Martin, who finished 13th, one place behind Tour de France winner Chris Froome. \n \n Serbian rowers Milos Vasic and Nenad Bedik capsized in choppy waters at the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, but won a reprieve when they were allowed to move into the next round. \n \n French gymnast Samir Ait Said suffered Olympic agony. His lower left leg snapped and skewed to a gruesome angle when he landed awkwardly from a vault. \n \n Yusra Mardini, the Syrian refugee who was swimming for her life to a Greek island less than a year ago, won her 100m butterfly heat but failed to reach the semi-finals. \n \n \"Everything was amazing. It was the only thing I ever wanted was to compete in the Olympics,\" said the 18-year-old, who is representing the Games' first ever refugee team. ||||| Officials stand near the body of a man that was shot and killed near Maracana Stadium. (Photo: Mark Humphrey, AP) \n \n RIO DE JANEIRO \u2014 Rio police say a man was shot dead near Maracana Stadium after Friday's Olympic opening ceremony. \n \n According to Rio's Civil Police Department, a 22-year-old Brazilian named Ronaldo Marques de Souza was assaulting people in the crowd as the 53,000 attendees were being let out of the stadium. An officer from an unidentified agency who was assisting with Olympic security responded and shot the man, according to a statement. \n \n Brazilian officials have pulled in police from around the country to conduct security around the Games, a total of 85,000 law enforcement officials. The statement from Rio police said the officer came from another state in Brazil, but did not specify which one. \n \n Associated Press photographers gave a different account of the shooting. They reported hearing multiple, loud gun shots, forcing Games volunteers and others leaving the ceremony to duck for cover behind cars. The photographers said they then saw a shooter running from the scene and fleeing in a car close to a university parking lot. \n \n After police and medics arrived on the scene, paramedics were seen treating the victim as blood poured from his body onto the road. \n \n Rio police says it is continuing its investigation. \n \n This is the second shooting death in the Olympic city this week, and that one has varying descriptions as well. Brazil police originally said a Russian diplomat fought off a would-be robber, whose gun went off. The alleged assailant was killed. The Russian embassy, though, said no Russian official was involved. ||||| Rio De Janeiro: A stray bullet, believed to have been fired from a Brazilian military rifle, has narrowly missed photographers during the first day of Olympic competition at the Equestrian Centre in Rio De Janeiro. \n \n Olympic organisers and the military are trying to work out where the bullet, which pierced the plastic roof of the media centre canvas and landed within metres of photographers, came from. \n \n British freelance photographer Jon Stroud, who was sitting closest to where the bullet landed, expanded on the frightening ordeal which shocked the entire media centre located next to the Brazilian military base in Deodoro. \n \n \"It was general disbelief,\" Stroud said. \n \n SHARE \n \n Share on Facebook SHARE \n \n Share on Twitter TWEET \n \n Link The bullet which landed inside the media centre at the Olympic Equestrian Centre.

Read more \n \n Even as organisers scrambled to investigate both issues, they were also having to promise to redouble efforts to shift unsold tickets and improve long queueing times amid angry complaints from those who had not been able to enter venues in time to watch the action. \n \n While there was an upbeat mood in the city and organisers were pleased with the reaction to Friday\u2019s opening ceremony, empty seats in many venues and long queues to get into others soon caused frustration and delays. \n \n The most dramatic incident of the day came as eyewitnesses reported a bullet from a 5.56mm assault rifle pierced the roof of the media tent and fell to the floor near a Team GB press officer and a British photographer working for the British Equestrian Foundation. \n \n The venue is next door to a media base and there was speculation that it may have accidentally been fired from there. A Rio 2016 spokesman said: \u201cWe are aware of the incident and monitoring the investigation by the security forces. No one was hurt.\u201d \n \n At Copacabana, as crowds gathered to watch the denouement to the men\u2019s cycling road race, there was a brief commotion when bomb control officers arrived suddenly to detonate a suspect package about 150 yards from the finish line. \u201cThe security services found a suspicious package \u2026 and as a precaution decided to perform a controlled explosion,\u201d said a Rio 2016 spokesman. \n \n Officials said there was no impact on the race, which was at that point only halfway through. The suspect package was believed to be a small bag. \n \n On the morning after the opening ceremony the night before, largely well received by the Brazilian media and public, organisers hoped to maintain the momentum. But huge swaths of empty seats visible in the gymnastics, boxing, handball, rugby sevens and hockey arenas as the action got under way detracted from the picture postcard backdrops on show elsewhere. \n \n On Copacabana, fans faced huge queues to enter the beach volleyball arena while others waited in line to buy tickets. Meanwhile the action started in front of largely empty stands, although they were much fuller later with Brazilian athletes in action. \n \n While some queues were good-natured, at others fans became angry at having to endure lengthy security queues. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s absurd, ridiculous,\u201d said Natalia Carvalho, 28, a Rio resident who had wanted to see Brazilian gymnast and medal hopeful Arthur Zanetti compete. \n \n Games organisers blamed the situation on a lack of coordination between various groups of security personnel, including the police, Games staff and private security firms. The Rio 2016 director of communications blamed it on the fact \u201cthe systems did not talk to each other\u201d. \n \n In a later statement, organisers said: \u201cWe apologise to any spectators who have had to queue on the first day of competition. We are fully aware of the problem and frustration it causes. We requested that the relevant authorities increase the speed and effectiveness that people can enter the park by requesting more employees to work on the x-ray machines. \n \n \u201cFollowing improvements the lines returned to normal by mid-morning. We appreciate the patience and understanding shown by fans and will use this experience to improve for the forthcoming days of competition.\u201d \n \n The Deodoro Stadium in the north of the city was almost entirely empty at 11am when rugby returned to the Olympics, except for a few small bands of travelling fans cowering in the shade. But it filled up a little before Brazil\u2019s match against Great Britain, as a few hundred home fans turned out to cheer their team. \n \n Greg Van Avermaet grabs gold amid the carnage in Rio 2016 road race Read more \n \n At the morning swimming heats at the Aquatics Centre on the Olympic Park in Barra, about 20km from central Rio, the stands were roughly a third full. Venues started to fill up as the day went on and in previous Games, notably in Beijing, there have been empty seats in the first few days and stands have become fuller as the fortnight has gone on. \n \n But there remains substantial scepticism over the official figure of 80%, or 4.9m, tickets having been sold. As revealed by the Guardian earlier this week, organisers outlined plans to give away ticket to schoolchildren. The first tranche will involve around 240,000 tickets at less popular sports such as rugby sevens and golf. \n \n \u201cAs we have already reached 100% of our revenue target, where we have places available for some sessions, we will give the opportunity to students of our education programme, Transforma, volunteers, and other partner projects, as part of our engagement effort,\u201d said a spokesman. \n \n \u201cWe are conducting the first Olympic Games in South America and we want to take this opportunity to bring the sports and the athletes closer to the warmth of the young Brazilians.\u201d \n \n Organisers have also accelerated their advertising campaign to sell tickets for less popular sports under the slogan \u201cThere is emotion in every place\u201d. \n \n A spokesman said that there was a daily acceleration in sales and that they were relying on the fact Brazilians traditionally bought tickets at the last minute. \n \n However, the website shows that tickets remain available not only for the football and less popular sports but for some of the blue riband events on the track and in the pool.",
    "reference": "\u2013 It's been an eventful first two days for the Rio Olympics, but probably not in the way organizers were hoping. Brazilian police say an officer shot and killed a 22-year-old man who was attacking people as they left Maracana stadium Friday following the opening ceremony, USA Today reports. According to AFP, the man was mugging people. But reporters at the scene say it happened completely differently. They say people ducked for cover when gunshots rang out as thousands of people left the stadium. They then saw the shooter running into a nearby car and driving off. On Saturday, the Brazilian military executed a controlled explosion near the finish line of the men's road cycling race. They were blowing up a suspicious bag that had been left unattended, the Guardian reports. Officials say the bag may have belonged to a homeless man, but they had to take precautions. The racers were 60 miles away at the time, but the explosion \"stunned\" people hoping to watch the end of the race, according to AFP. The Sydney Morning Herald reports a bullet came ripping through the media room at the Deodora equestrian center and landed near a photographer Saturday. No one was hurt, but the bullet left a hole in the tent's roof. The venue is near a military base, and it's possible the bullet was accidentally fired toward the venue by someone on the base."

In other words, that\u2019s an additional 258 hours per year or an hour more each weekday. The working paper, which has not yet been published, was written by three economists\u2014Alexander Bick of Arizona State University, Bettina Bruggeman of McMaster University in Ontario, and Nicola Fuchs-Schundeln of Goethe University Frankfurt. \n \n The authors looked at 18 European countries and the U.S. Of the 19 total countries they examined, the U.S. came out on top averaging 26.1 hours per person per week; Italy worked the fewest hours with an average of 18.4 hours. \n \n The study looked at hours per person. It doesn\u2019t only include people currently in the workforce, but those either retired or taking time off for some other reason, like unemployment or vacation. Ultimately, it doesn\u2019t measure productivity, but rather total time spent at work. \n \n The disparity in hours worked between the U.S. and Europe could be explained in various ways or, more likely, is an amalgamation of numerous different reasons. Taxes, for one, are much higher in Europe than in the U.S. According to Bloomberg, that gives European workers less incentive to work longer hours. It may also have something to do with labor unions, which generally have more power in Europe than they do in the U.S. \n \n Additionally, Europeans tend to get generous pensions, rather than investment plans like the 401(k) many American workers receive. As a result, there are more American workers over 65-years-old now than there have been at any point in the past 50 years.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Feel like you're working too much? Consider moving to Europe: Europeans work 19% fewer hours than US workers, or about one hour less per weekday, a new paper finds. Researchers looked at three labor-force surveys from the US and Europe to find out how many hours a person works, on average, in various countries. They found that Americans work an average of 1,353 hours per year, the highest number of the 19 countries studied, Fortune reports. Compare that to Italy, where each person only works an average of 960 hours per year, the lowest number of hours of any country studied. Americans are also retiring later, taking less vacation time, and, as Quartz reports, are more likely to work odd hours, such as the middle of the night or weekends. As recently as the early 1970s, US and Western European workers actually clocked about the same number of hours, Bloomberg reports. It's not clear what's changed or how to account for the discrepancy, but some economists point to the fact that there's more incentive to work harder for a promotion in the US, because people earn a wider range of incomes there than in Europe, so it's more likely they'll get a significant raise. There's also the fact that taxes are significantly higher in Europe, meaning that there's less of an incentive to work more hours and earn more money that will be taxed. Finally, there's the fact that labor unions and worker protections are stronger in Europe, and pensions are more generous there."

Aid for rebel-held Madaya was contingent on help for government-controlled Foah and Kefraya. \n \n Images of Madaya's emaciated children sparked alarm in many capitals and created greater impetus but they also provoked a war of words. \n \n Supporters of the Syrian government and its Lebanese Hezbollah allies accused rebel forces in Madaya of seizing food for themselves. Some even mocked reports of starvation. The opposition charged President Assad's forces with more war crimes. \n \n Today, Madaya is the face of Syria's suffering. Two years ago, it was Yarmouk. \n \n These are moments that mobilise the world's sympathy but over the past year, only 10% of the UN's requests to deliver aid to people to in besieged and hard-to-reach areas were granted.

Al-Baath newspaper accuses Al Jazeera and Al-Arabiya of a \"misleading campaign, using photos of displaced and sick people from all over the world\", and says the rebels are using civilians as human shields, \n \n Some commentators try to take a broader view. Muhammad Kharrub in the Jordanian newspaper, Al-Rai, complains that the rebels themselves are besieging government-held towns, and Mahir Maqlad in Egypt's Al-Ahram notes that both sides \"keep their information ambiguous to suit their own interests\". \n \n MSF said on Sunday that a total of 28 people - including six children less than one year old - had died of starvation in Madaya since 1 December. \n \n However, Hezbollah has denied that there have been any deaths in the town, and accused rebel leaders of preventing people from leaving. \n \n Blockades have been a feature of Syria's civil war. Up to 4.5 million people live in hard-to-reach areas, including nearly 400,000 people in 15 besieged locations who do not have access to life-saving aid. \n \n In a separate development on Monday, activists said at least 12 children had been killed in an air strike on a school in the rebel-held town of Ain Jara, in Aleppo province. \n \n What's happening in Syria? \n \n More than 250,000 Syrians have lost their lives in almost five years of conflict, which began with anti-government protests before escalating into a brutal civil war. More than 11 million others have been forced from their homes as forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and rebels opposed to his rule battle each other - as well as jihadist militants from Islamic State. \n \n Why are civilians under siege? \n \n All parties to the conflict are using siege warfare, encircling populated areas, preventing civilians from leaving and blocking humanitarian access in an attempt to force opponents to surrender. Shortages of food, water, medicine, electricity and fuel have led to malnutrition and deaths among vulnerable groups. \n \n Where are the sieges? \n \n Government forces are besieging various locations in the eastern Ghouta area, outside Damascus, as well as the capital's western suburb of Darayya and the nearby mountain towns of Zabadani and Madaya.

People there make soups of grass, spices and olive leaves. They eat donkeys and cats. They arrive, collapsing, at a clinic that offers little but rehydration salts. Neighbors fail to recognize neighbors in the streets because their faces are so sunken. \n \n Syria, once classified as a middle-income country, now reports periodic malnutrition deaths. At least 28 people, including six babies, have died from hunger-related causes at a clinic in Madaya aided by Doctors Without Borders, medics there say. And the 42,000 people that the United Nations counts as trapped in Madaya are about a tenth of those stranded in besieged or hard-to-reach areas as conditions grow steadily worse. \n \n Their plight represents a stark failure of international powers that has worsened even as they intensify military and diplomatic activities, all in the name of resolving the conflict. ||||| Play Facebook \n \n Twitter \n \n Embed Aid Trucks Finally Enter Besieged, Starving Syrian City of Madaya 2:07 autoplay autoplay Copy this code to your website or blog \n \n An aid convoy entered the blockaded town of Madaya on Monday, bearing desperately-needed food and supplies for thousands of starving Syrians. \n \n Horrific images of emaciated residents and tales of desperation have emerged from Madaya, which has been blockaded for six months by government and pro-government forces. \n \n A group of people are waiting for the humanitarian #aid #convoy at an entrance to #Madaya. photo AFP pic.twitter.com/1kZLv5skU9 -Vivian Toumeh (@VToumeh) January 11, 2016 \n \n More than two dozen people \u2014 including at least six under the age of 1 \u2014 have died of starvation since Dec. 1, according to Doctors Without Borders, which called it an \"open air prison\" with no way in or out.

Activists have reported several deaths from starvation over the past weeks in the affected areas, and images of starvation have been circulated across social media. \n \n The United Nations and Red Cross also reported that the convoys were on their way, while the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the aid was expected to reach the towns in the coming hours. \n \n The television channel of Hezbollah, which is fighting in Syria alongside Assad's forces, reported that 40 trucks were expected to enter the northern villages, with another 40 headed to Madaya. In Madaya, Al-Manar showed a group of people including women and children waiting for the convoys at the town's main entrance. \n \n The U.N.'s World Food Programme has said it will ship one month's worth of food for more than 40,000 people to Madaya from Damascus, and enough for 20,000 people to Foua and Kfarya from the city of Homs. \n \n Also Monday, SANA reported that rocket fire presumably fired by rebels hit a residential neighborhood in the northern city of Aleppo, killing three children and wounding two other people.

    "reference": "\u2013 Residents of a Syrian town trapped in the nation's civil war are finally getting some desperately needed relief: UN convoys with food and medicine headed to Madaya on Monday, reports the BBC. Shocking stories have emerged about the plight of the estimated 40,000 people there. Doctors Without Borders says 28 people\u2014including six babies\u2014have starved to death since December 1, with another 250 people currently suffering from \"acute malnutrition.\" The situation has become so dire that residents have resorted to eating cats, reports NBC News. The convoys also will deliver supplies to two other villages in northern Syria, reports the AP, and the New York Times has a more in-depth piece explaining what's happening. Madaya is controlled by anti-government forces but encircled by government troops, and the UN struck a deal last week to allow the aid. The bigger problem is that about 400,000 Syrians are believed to be trapped in similar situations elsewhere. \"Using hunger as a weapon flies in the face of international law,\" notes the analysis. \"Yet global and regional powers\u2014like Russia, Iran, the United States and Saudi Arabia\u2014are unable or unwilling to pressure their battlefield allies.\""

Lanza killed 20 children and six adults before turning the gun on himself. \n \n Lanza also killed his mother Nancy Lanza at the home they shared before going to school. \n \n \"There are many, many witnesses that need to be interviewed,\" Vance said. \"We will not stop until we have interviewed every last one of them.\" \n \n Vance said the investigation could take weeks or months to complete. \"It's not something done in 60 minutes like you see on T.V.\" \n \n Some of the other key witnesses will be children who survived the shooting spree by playing dead, hiding in closets and bathrooms and being rescued by dedicated teachers. \n \n \"Any interviews with any children will be done with professionals...as appropriate,\" Vance said. \"We'll handle that extremely delicately when the time arises.\" \n \n CLICK HERE for a tribute to the shooting victims. \n \n The first funerals for victims of the shooting are today, beginning with 6-year-olds Noah Pozner and Jack Pinto. \n \n Officials said today that the Sandy Hook Elementary School, where the shooting took place, will be closed \"indefinitely.\" \n \n Both the school and the home where shootings took place are being held by police as crime scenes and Vance predicted authorities would spend \"months\" investigating the elementary school. \n \n All Newtown schools are closed today to give residents more time to cope. Every school except for Sandy Hook is expected to re-open Tuesday. \n \n The town of Monroe has offered to open to Sandy Hook students the Chalk Hill School, a former middle school that currently houses the town's EMS and recreational departments. \n \n Officials in Monroe, less than 10 miles from Newtown, say the building could be ready for students by the end of the week, but have not yet set a date to resume classes. \n \n Nearly 100 volunteers are working to ensure the building complies with fire and security regulations and are working to retorfit the school with bathroom facilities for young children. \n \n \"We're working to make the school safe and secure for students,\" said Monroe Police Department spokesman Lt. Brian H. McCauley. \n \n The neighboring community's school is expected to be ready to accommodate students in the next few days, though an exact schedule has not yet been published. \n \n While the families grieve, federal and state authorities are working around the clock to answer the question on so many minds: \"Why?\" \n \n ABC News has learned that investigators have seized computers belonging to Adam Lanza from the home he shared with his mother. Three weapons were found at the school scene and a fourth was recovered from Lanza's car. Lanza had hundreds of rounds and used multiple high-capacity magazines when he went on the rampage, according to Connecticut State Police. \n \n Vance said that every single electronic device, weapon and round will be thoroughly examined and investigated as well as every aspect of Lanza's life going \"back to the date of birth.\" \n \n ABC News has learned that both the shooter and his mother spent time at an area gun range; however it was not yet known whether they had shot there. \n \n President Obama delivered an emotional address at an interfaith prayer vigil in Newtown on Sunday night, comforting the community. \n \n \"I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation,\" the president said. \"I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow nor can they heal your wounded hearts. I can only hope it helps to know you are not alone ... and that all across this land we have wept with you.\" \n \n \"These tragedies must end,\" Obama said. \"And to end them we must change.\" \n \n Thousands came out of the prayer vigil where Red Cross members distributed stuffed dogs to children and adults wept in the auditorium. \n \n \"We needed this.

Some were hit 11 times. \n \n But the official said it did not appear that Mr. Lanza had left any letters or notes that would offer a motive for the killings, or explain why he had targeted the school. \n \n As investigators continued to examine other evidence they had seized, the first funerals were held on a gloomy and chaotic day that brought word of a second survivor, a school employee who was wounded but had not been mentioned in earlier accounts of the carnage. Her name was not immediately released. The other survivor at Sandy Hook was identified as the school\u2019s lead teacher, Natalie Hammond, 40. \n \n The spokesman for the State Police, Lt. J. Paul Vance, said investigators would \u201cexamine everything and anything,\u201d including cellphones, game consoles and \u201canything that can provide us with information\u201d about Mr. Lanza and his motivations for the rampage. \n \n Photo \n \n But he provided no indication as to why Mr. Lanza had trained such firepower on the students in two classrooms at the school. Lieutenant Vance said Mr. Lanza had \u201cno connection\u201d to the school. \n \n Mr. Lanza, 20, lived with his mother in a house about five miles away. She owned the guns he fired and the car he drove to the school. Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives have determined that Mr. Lanza and his mother had visited firing ranges, sometimes together, sometimes separately, according to a federal law enforcement official. The agents have been interviewing firearm dealers in Connecticut to \u201cget a clear picture of what activities took place\u201d before the shooting, said the official, who would not identify the shooting ranges. \n \n Monday brought a new and grim reality to schools across the country. In some places, armed officers greeted students amid tighter safety procedures, and education officials rethought their security policies. There was a large police presence outside a funeral home in Newtown after what Lt. James Perez of the Fairfield Police Department described as vague threats of protests and \u201cstupid comments\u201d on the Internet and on social media. \n \n In Ridgefield, Conn., a half-hour\u2019s drive from Newtown, the police received a call about a \u201csuspicious\u201d stranger dressed in black and carrying what appeared to be a rifle. He was said to be walking from a train station toward an elementary school before the school day had even begun. \n \n Officials ordered a lockdown \u2014 effectively a lockout, since most of the students were on school buses that had not arrived yet. The buses were diverted to another school while the police searched the area. The students were let into the school about four hours later, and the police eventually arrested a suspect, Wilfredo M. Seda, 22, of Redding, Conn. He had an umbrella that \u201chad the outward appearance of a Samurai sword,\u201d the Ridgefield police said in a statement. He was charged with a breach of the peace. \n \n In Newtown, classes were canceled on Monday, and it was not clear whether students would ever attend classes in the Sandy Hook building again. Gov. Dannel P. Malloy approved an arrangement for the students to use a surplus school building a few miles away, in Monroe, and the children\u2019s desks from Sandy Hook were moved there. \n \n Mr. Malloy held an emotional news conference in Hartford during which he described his decision to tell the last, desperate parents at the firehouse in Newtown on Friday that none of their loved ones had survived the massacre. Struggling to keep his composure, the governor said that it had become clear there was no protocol that could be followed, and that rather than relying on the traditional routine of having relatives identify a body, he felt the best thing to do was simply to tell them there was no hope. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cI made the decision that to have that go on any longer was wrong,\u201d he said. \n \n Mr. Lanza\u2019s mother had divorced his father, Peter J. Lanza, in 2008, citing \u201cirreconcilable differences\u201d after 27 years of marriage. The couple had joint custody of Adam Lanza, but he was expected to \u201creside primarily with the mother,\u201d according to divorce settlement papers filed in Stamford Superior Court. \n \n The settlement was generous to Ms. Lanza and her sons \u2014 Adam had an older brother, Ryan. She got the family house, and Mr. Lanza was to provide $240,000 a year in alimony starting in 2010. The amount was to increase annually through 2015, when it was to reach $298,800. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Those, the settlement said, included \u201chospital, optical, psychiatric, psychological and nursing expenses.\u201d \n \n A mediator who worked with the couple told The Associated Press that they told her that Adam Lanza had received a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome. \n \n Some details about Adam Lanza\u2019s teenage years also emerged. Around the time the divorce was in the works, he attended Western Connecticut State University as a part-time student. He did not make much of an impression. \n \n Prof. Renate Ludanyi, the director of the university\u2019s German studies center, said that Mr. Lanza was a student in her class during spring 2009, according to her grade books. But she said her memories of him were faint. \u201cIf at all I remember a quiet kid, a quiet young man sitting by the door,\u201d she said. \n \n Mr. Lanza dropped out of the class before the final grades were compiled. His grades until then had been \u201cmedium to not very good,\u201d she said. ||||| Computerworld - The FBI is reportedly examining a hard drive found in the bedroom of Connecticut school shooter Adam Lanza in the hopes that they can glean insight into the 20-year-old's activities before the Friday rampage that left 28 people -- including Lanza himself -- dead. \n \n Although police have refused to publicly confirm that they're using forensics technology to retrieve information from the drive, published reports cited police officials who said a drive, broken into pieces, was found outside of Lanza's computer. \n \n According to those sources, FBI forensics experts will examine the drive to try to figure out who Lanza corresponded with before the massacre and how else he may have used the computer. \n \n Lanza, who lived in his mother's Newtown, Conn. home, shot his mother in the head with a rifle early Friday, according to police. He then went to Sandy Hook Elementary School with his mother's AR-15 .223 caliber rifle, two semi-automatic handguns and enough ammunition to kill everyone in the school, police said. Lanza killed 20 students, all of them 6 or 7 years old, and six faculty members before police arrived. He committed suicide at the school by shooting himself. \n \n Little is known about Lanza's personal life. According to media reports, his mother was a private person who rarely talked about her son. \n \n \"They're going to try to find a reason why...he went from fanaticizing about this to doing it,\" said Marc Rogers, chair of the Cyber Forensics Program in the Department of Computer and Information Technology at Purdue University. \"Were there any early indications that he was getting ready to act these fantasies out? In some cases there are and in some there aren't.\" \n \n Lanza's rampage was likely done for \"maximum media impact,\" Rogers said, so investigators will also be looking for a manifesto or some other statement the 20-year-old may have left on his computer or communicated to someone electronically. \n \n Michael Kessler, CEO of forensics data recovery firm Kessler International, said that if Lanza knew enough to remove the hard drive from his computer and break it, it's unlikely investigators will be able to retrieve data from it. \n \n \"Obviously, they [law enforcement] have a lot of resources to do it. And, if the drive's platters aren't smashed they can put them into another drive and read them,\" he said. \"But if he [Lanza] broke the platters, the likelihood of data recovery is slim to none.\" \n \n According to Brian Cane, a consultant with ECO Data Recovery in Florida, the recovery effort will hinge on how technically savvy Lanza was - whether or not he knew to break, scratch or drill holes in his drive platters.",

Experts had earlier told ComputerWorld that the recovery effort would depend on whether Lanza knew enough to break, scratch, or puncture the drive platters. \"If the drive's platters aren't smashed they can put them into another drive and read them,\" the CEO of forensics data recovery firm Kessler International says. \"But if he broke the platters, the likelihood of data recovery is slim to none.\" \"It looked like he took steps to damage it\u2014he smashed it,\" confirmed an official to the Times."

As such, the National Park guarantees the connectivity and preservation of the biodiversity of these provinces, constituting itself as an interaction scenario in which flora and fauna diversity and endemism have flourished. One of the defining features of Chiribiquete is the presence of tepuis (table-top mountains), sheer-sided sandstone plateaux that outstand in the forest and result in dramatic scenery that is reinforced by its remoteness, inaccessibility and exceptional conservation. Over 75,000 figures have been made by indigenous people on the walls of the 60 rock shelters from 20,000 BCE, and are still made nowadays by the uncontacted peoples protected by the National Park. These paintings depict hunting scenes, battles, dances and ceremonies, as well as fauna and flora species, with a particular the worship of the jaguar, a symbol of power and fertility. The indigenous communities, which are not directly present on the site, consider Chiribiquete as a sacred place that cannot be visited and that should be preserved unaltered. ||||| Mysterious stone spheres dot the Pre-Colombian Chiefdom Settlements of the Diquis in Costa Rica, which is now a World Heritage site. \n \n Enigmatic archaeological sites in Costa Rica dotted with mysterious stone spheres are among six new spots newly designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites. \n \n The stone sphere sites, on the Diquis Delta in southern Costa Rica, join places like the Great Wall of China and Yellowstone National Park on the list of 1,007 sites designated as World Heritage Sites by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The organization lists places that are \"of outstanding universal value,\" based on criteria such as representing a masterpiece of creative genius, recording testimony of a vanished civilization, or containing exceptional natural beauty. \n \n The U.N.'s World Heritage Committee, currently meeting in Doha, Qatar, announced the additions to the list today (June 23). Other than the Diquis Delta sites, the new honorees include the architectural remnants of a medieval Eurasian city, spectacular landscapes in Vietnam and India, a wildlife sanctuary in the Philippines and a site offering geological evidence of the meteorite collision that killed off the dinosaurs. [See Photos of the New World Heritage Sites] \n \n The new sites are: \n \n 1. Bolgar Historical and Archaeological Complex, the Russian Federation: Along the banks of the Volga River, south of Kazan, Tatarstan, is an archaeological site containing the remnants of the medieval city of Bolgar. Built in the seventh century by a civilization called the Volga-Bolgars, Bolgar remained an important town until the 15th century, according to UNESCO. In the 1200s, it was the capital of the Golden Horde, the northwestern region of the Mongol Empire. The Volga-Bolgars converted to Islam in A.D. 922, and the site remains a destination for pilgrimages by Tatar Muslims today. \n \n 2. Pre-Colombian Chiefdom Settlements with Stone Spheres of the Diquis, Costa Rica: Consisting of four archaeological sites in the Diquis Delta, this new site encompasses the archaeological remains of human civilization before Europeans arrived in Costa Rica. The sites date to between A.D. 500 and 1500 and include burial sites, paved areas and mounds, according to UNESCO. Most intriguing, however, are the stone spheres that dot the sites. These spheres range in size from 2.3 feet to 8.4 feet (0.7 to 2.57 meters) in diameter, and many remain in the locations where they were placed centuries ago. No one knows how the stones were made \u2014 or why. [The 7 Most Mysterious Archaeological Finds on Earth] \n \n 3. Trang An Scenic Landscape Complex, Vietnam: The stunning landscape on the south side of the Red River delta in Vietnam earned this area a place on the UNESCO list. Dramatic limestone peaks and mountainside caves define this region of so-called karst topography. (Karst landscapes are formed when easily dissolvable rocks such as limestone erode into impressive shapes, typically pockmarked with caves.) The caves contain artifacts of human settlement dating back 30,000 years. Today, the site also includes Hoa Lu, the capital of Vietnam in the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as villages, temples and farms. \n \n The Great Himalayan National Park in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh was inscribed in June 2014 as a World Heritage site. Credit: \u00a9 IUCN/Graeme Worboys \n \n 4. Great Himalayan National Park, India: This national park in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh is rich in both beauty and biodiversity. Located in the western Himalayan Mountains, the park's landscapes include low, wet plains, high, dry deserts, mountain peaks and major rivers. Threatened species, including the endangered snow leopard and red-headed vulture, call this park home. This site is extremely important for biodiversity conservation, according to UNESCO. \n \n 5. Mount Hamiguitan Range Wildlife Sanctuary, Philippines: The iconic Philippine eagle and the striking white-and-red Philippine cockatoo make their homes in this species-rich sanctuary, which runs north-south along the Pujada Peninsula of the Philippines. At least 11 endangered vertebrates live in the range, along with dozens of species that can be found nowhere else on Earth. \n \n 6. Stevns Klint, Denmark: The striking white chalk cliffs on Denmark's island of Zealand aren't just beautiful. They're paleontological wonders. These cliffs are made of rocks set down at the end of the Cretaceous and the beginning of the Tertiary 65 million years ago. A layer of ash likely marks the spot in time when a meteorite crashed half a world away in Mexico, filling the atmosphere with sun-obscuring dust and probably killing off the dinosaurs. This 9-mile-long (15 km) stretch of cliffs is the longest, best-exposed geological site showing this boundary between eras, according to UNESCO. \n \n In addition to the six new sites, UNESCO expanded three existing World Heritage sites. These expanded regions include the South China Karst site, which will now be 124 acres (50,000 hectares) larger. This site, on the list since 2007, encompasses a stunning karst landscape in four provinces in southern China. \n \n The second extension was granted to the Bia\u0142owie\u017ca Forest on the border of Belarus and Poland, which has been a World Heritage Site since 1979. Here, primary forest provides shelter for the European bison, which was once hunted to extinction in the wild. Now reintroduced, the bison is Europe's largest land animal. \n \n Finally, UNESCO extended the Dutch and German Wadden Sea World Heritage Site, which has been on the list since 2009. This expanse of wetlands and mud flats sits in the southeastern North Sea and is home to hundreds of thousands of birds, as well as seals and other species. \n \n Editor's Note: If you have an amazing World Heritage Site photo you'd like to share for a possible story or image gallery, please contact managing editor Jeanna Bryner at LSphotos@livescience.com. \n \n Follow Stephanie Pappas on Twitterand Google+.

Botswana's unique inland delta, which does not flow into a sea, was described by Unesco as \"an exceptional example of the interaction between climatic, hydrological and biological processes \u2026 home to some of the world's most endangered species of large mammal.\" \n \n Its addition comes after almost a decade of advocacy from conservationists and scientific researchers. Speaking to the Guardian, Dr Steve Boyes, scientific director of the Wild Bird Trust who has worked as a wilderness guide in the Okavango, described the news as highly important, but \"long overdue\". \n \n \"The region has Africa's largest elephant population and is considered a sanctuary for white and black rhinoceros,\" he says. \"The listing will serve as a celebration of this unique wilderness as well as a call to action. All of this will be for nothing if Angola or Namibia decide to develop dams, weirs and mines along the Okavango river \u2013 so now begins the much bigger job of preserving the unprotected Angolan catchment. By 2025, we will know whether the Okavango Delta will survive into the distant future.\" \n \n A cave drawing in the Grotte Chauvet in Ardeche, France. Photograph: Inocybe/Wikimedia Commons \n \n The Grotte Chauvet in the Ardeche, France \u2013 home to the earliest known and best preserved figurative drawings in the world and described as an \"exceptional testimony of prehistoric art\" \u2013 was also added to the list. The cave, which remained cut off by a rockfall for 20,000 years until its discovery in 1994, contains over 1,000 images dating back to the Aurignacian period (30,000-32,000 years ago). While the closely guarded cave is off-limits to visitors, a replica is due to open in 2015. \n \n \"Its state of preservation and authenticity is exceptional as a result of its concealment over 23 millennia,\" Unesco said. \n \n Other inclusions, which consist of both cultural and natural sites, are the vineyard landscape of Piedmont in Italy, which has been a historic site for wine making since the fifth century BC, a series of properties in the city of Bursa, Turkey, that demonstrate the social and economic functions of the Ottoman empire, and the Great Himalayan national park, a stunning yet fragile ecosystem that is home to many endangered species and will now receive close monitoring and observation of its biodiversity. \n \n The vineyard region of Piedmont, Italy was added to the Unesco list. Photograph: Alamy \n \n Burma made its entry on to the list for the first time when the Pyu ancient cities were awarded heritage status. The trio of brick, walled and moated cities of Halin, Beikthano and Sri Ksetra include excavated palace citadels and burial grounds as well as monumental brick Buddhist stupas. \n \n Another notable addition is the prehistoric earthworks of Poverty Point in Louisiana, USA. The complex of ancient mounds and ridges were created for residential and ceremonial purposes between 3,700 and 3,100BC. The site was praised by Unesco as: \"A remarkable achievement in earthen construction in North America that was not surpassed for at least 2,000 years.\" \n \n The decision, which was welcomed by the US Department of State, comes a year after the US lost its Unesco voting rights along with Israel. The US has had far less influence over Unesco decisions since withdrawing its financial contributions to the organisation in 2011 after the Palestinian government was granted full membership. \n \n A chalk cave in Bet Guvrin, Israel. Photograph: Alamy \n \n Both Israel and Palestine had sites added to the list this week. The Palestinian village of Battir and its \"cultural landscape\" \u2013 currently under threat from the Israeli separation barrier \u2013 was added to the list on Friday, while the caves of Maresha and Bet Guvrin in Israel, an area of vast chalk caves in the Judean lowlands, gained world heritage status on Sunday. \n \n Other sites awarded Unesco world heritage status this year include Qhapaq Nan, a vast Inca road system in Peru, and the fossil rich coastal cliff site of Stevns Kilt in Denmark, which offers \"exceptional evidence of the impact of the Chicxulub meteorite that crashed into the planet about 65 millions years ago.\" \n \n In order to be selected for the list, sites must be considered of outstanding universal value. Cultural sites are judged against a set of criteria such as whether it represents \"a masterpiece of human creative genius\" while the criteria for natural sites includes whether it \"contains superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty\". \n \n More sites are expected to be added over the next two days as delegates at the world heritage committee work their way through the 40 sites up for consideration for special status during the organisation's 38th session held in Doha, Qatar. ||||| Heritage is our legacy from the past, what we live with today, and what we pass on to future generations.

France's Grotte Chauvet, site of the world's oldest figurative drawings. The pictures, found in 1994, date back some 30,000 to 32,000 years. The vineyards of Piedmont, Italy, where wine has been made since the fifth century BC. The white cliffs known as Stevns Klint, Denmark.

    "input": "LONDON (Reuters) - The parents of terminally ill baby Charlie Gard on Tuesday accused a London hospital of preventing their son from coming home to die, the latest harrowing confrontation in a legal battle that has raised emotions far and wide. \n \n Great Ormond Street Hospital\u2019s lawyer told the High Court it had moved \u201cheaven and earth\u201d to allow 11-month-old Charlie to go home, but this was impossible for practical reasons. \n \n The judge said transferring Charlie to a hospice for his last moments -- a move supported by the hospital -- appeared the most realistic option. \n \n The plight of Charlie, who suffers from a rare genetic condition causing progressive brain damage and muscle weakness, has been at the center of a bitter dispute between his parents and the hospital. \n \n The case has triggered a debate on social media and in the press about whether doctors, judges or parents should decide a child\u2019s fate. U.S. President Donald Trump and Pope Francis are among many people who have weighed in with views. \n \n Staff at Great Ormond Street, a hospital so revered in Britain that it was featured in the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics, have received death threats and abuse. \n \n \u201cEmotions are as high in this case as they could be in any,\u201d said the presiding judge, Nicholas Francis. \n \n He gave Charlie\u2019s legal team until Wednesday to see if they could find an intensive care team willing to look after Charlie at his home or at a hospice for several days, in accordance with the parents\u2019 wishes. \n \n Related Coverage UK hospital says baby Charlie Gard's care cannot be provided at home \n \n \u201cI will make my final decision tomorrow unless something completely new comes up,\u201d he said. A court hearing is scheduled for 1300 GMT on Wednesday. \n \n Charlie requires a ventilator to breathe and cannot see, hear or swallow. His parents, Chris Gard and Connie Yates, resigned themselves to letting him die after the most recent set of scans showed his condition had deteriorated to the point no recovery was possible. \n \n The couple want Charlie to be taken to their home or to the home of a close relative or friend for his last moments until his life support system is switched off. \n \n Their lawyer, Grant Armstrong, told the London High Court that Great Ormond Street was placing \u201cobstacle after obstacle\u201d in the way of the parents\u2019 wish. \n \n Charlie Gard's mother Connie Yates and her lawyer arrive at the High Court for a hearing on her son's end of life care, in London, Britain July 25, 2017. REUTERS/Peter Nicholls \n \n The hospital\u2019s lawyer, Katie Gollop, denied this. \n \n \u201dNothing could be further from the truth,\u201c she said. \u201dThe hospital has moved heaven and earth to make this possible for them. \n \n \u201cDREADFUL CIRCUMSTANCES\u201d \n \n The court heard that a team of two to three intensive care doctors and four to six intensive care nurses would be required along with the equipment, including a ventilator that could not fit through the front door of Charlie\u2019s home. \n \n Slideshow (6 Images) \n \n \u201cCharlie is a child who requires highly specialized treatment. His care cannot be simplified. It must be provided in a specialist setting by specialists,\u201d Gollop wrote in a document setting out the hospital\u2019s position for the court. \n \n She said the hospital had searched \u201cthe length and breadth of the country\u201d for an intensive care specialist willing to oversee the care at home, but in vain. This was partly because of the risk of Charlie dying unexpectedly. \n \n \u201cThat would be a disaster,\u201d said Francis, as Charlie\u2019s mother shook her head in disagreement. \n \n The judge said it appeared the only realistic option was for Charlie to be taken to a hospice where his ventilation tube would be removed shortly afterwards. The parents had wanted four days with Charlie before his death, Gollop said. \n \n Tuesday\u2019s proceedings were the latest in an agonizing series of court hearings. \n \n Charlie\u2019s parents had wanted to take him to the United States to undergo an experimental treatment never before tried on anyone with his condition, against the advice of Great Ormond Street doctors. Britain\u2019s courts, backed by the European Court of Human Rights, refused permission, saying it would prolong his suffering without any realistic prospect of helping him. \n \n The details of Tuesday\u2019s hearing suggested that the relationship between the parents and the hospital had broken down completely. The hospital said the parents had rejected an offer of mediation. \n \n \u201cToday, palliative care consultants at the hospital have had a lengthy, difficult and (sadly but understandably in the dreadful circumstances) unconstructive meeting with the parents,\u201d the hospital\u2019s legal document said. \n \n \u201cThere remains no agreed plan.\u201d ||||| Charlie Gard: judge to decide on parent's 'last wish' that son can die at home \n \n A judge will decide on Wednesday whether to grant the \u201clast wish\u201d of Charlie Gard\u2019s parents and allow their son to go home to die. \n \n \n \n A day after Connie Yates and Chris Gard ended their opposition to the removal of their critically ill baby\u2019s life support system, the couple returned to court on Tuesday to ask that Great Ormond Street hospital\u2019s objections to him being allowed to go home be overruled. \n \n During another tense hearing, the court heard the objections related to the impracticality of providing the intensive care 11-month-old Charlie is receiving in hospital at home for the \u201cperiod of days\u201d his parents want him kept alive. \n \n Timeline Charlie Gard Show Hide Birth Charlie Gard is born a \u201cperfectly healthy\u201d baby at full term and at a \u201chealthy weight\u201d. First symptoms His parents notice he is less able to lift his head and support himself than other babies of a similar age. Doctors discover that he has a rare inherited disease \u2013 infantile onset encephalomyopathy mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS). \n \n Hospital Charlie has become lethargic and his breathing is shallow. He is transferred to Great Ormond Street hospital for children in London on 11 October. \n \n Crowdfunding A crowdfunding page is set up to help finance trial therapy in the United States. Request to high court Great Ormond Street hospital bosses ask the high court judge, Mr Justice Francis, to rule that life-support treatment should stop. First ruling The judge says doctors can stop providing life-support treatment after analysing the case at a hearing in the family division of the high court. \n \n Appeal Charlie\u2019s parents ask three court of appeal judges to consider the case but less than three weeks later their appeal is dismissed. Supreme court ruling Charlie\u2019s parents lose their fight in the supreme court. European court of human rights The case proceeds to the European court of human rights but a week later it is announced that the European judges have refused to intervene. A Great Ormond Street spokeswoman says there will be \u201cno rush\u201d to change Charlie\u2019s care and says there will be \u201ccareful planning and discussion\u201d. More time It is thought that Charlie\u2019s life-support is due to be switched off but his parents say that Great Ormond Street doctors have agreed to \u201cgive us a little bit more time\u201d with Charlie. They ask for privacy \u201cwhile we prepare to say the final goodbye\u201d. Interventions Pope Francis and the US president, Donald Trump, intervene; the former calling for the couple to be allowed to \u201caccompany and treat their child until the end\u201d, saying he has followed the case with \u201caffection and sadness\u201d. Vatican hospital Bambino Gesu, the Vatican\u2019s children\u2019s hospital in Rome, offers to take Charlie in. Return to high court Charlie\u2019s parents return to the high court and ask Mr Justice Francis to carry out fresh analysis of the case. The judge says he will consider any new evidence. Dr Michio Hirano The New York neurology professor who offered to treat Charlie travels to London to examine the little boy, discuss the case with Great Ormond Street doctors and other clinicians and examine fresh scans. New scan The lawyer representing Great Ormond Street says the new scan makes for \u201csad reading\u201d. Abuse Great Ormond Street chairwoman Mary MacLeod says doctors and nurses have been subjected to abuse in the street and received thousands of threatening messages. Charlie\u2019s parents had previously urged people not to send abuse to Great Ormond Street staff. The end of the legal fight The judge\u2019s decision was initially expected the next day but a lawyer representing Charlie\u2019s parents say they are ending their legal fight over his treatment. \n \n But Grant Armstrong, the lawyer for Yates and Gard, said he was at pains to understand why the hospital sought to deny them their \u201clast wish\u201d. \n \n He said: \u201cWe struggle with the difficulties which the hospital has placed in the way of the parents\u2019 wish to have a period of time probably a relatively short period of time \u2026 before the final act in Charlie\u2019s short life.\u201d \n \n The infant\u2019s parents abandoned their fight to allow him to be flown to the US for experimental treatment on Monday, having determined it was no longer viable. \n \n But Armstrong said the couple had been forced to return to the high court in London on Tuesday for the \u201cmost difficult, emotional part of the case, [the] circumstances in which Charlie\u2019s passing will be conducted\u201d. \n \n He claimed that, having agreed in principle in April that it would be possible for Charlie to be flown to the US for treatment, it made no sense for Great Ormond Street hospital (Gosh) to say the child could not be taken to the family home in west London or that of one of their relatives \u2013 the parents\u2019 two preferred options. \n \n But Katie Gollop QC, for Gosh, said the flight to the US would have required a specialist intensive care team, which would not be available in a home setting for days on end. \n \n She said the hospital was willing to fulfil the parental wishes if it was \u201cpractical, possible and safe, and in Charlie\u2019s interests so that he comes to no harm\u201d. \n \n Victoria Butler-Cole, the lawyer instructed by Charlie\u2019s guardian, said the options with respect to him dying at home were withdrawing ventilation within \u201ca matter of hours\u201d or after \u201ca period of days\u201d. \n \n But she said the latter option was unrealistic because it would require \u201creplicating intensive care outside an intensive care unit\u201d, including a team of three doctors. \n \n Gosh said it was unable to provide such a team or source one from anywhere in the country. The court heard it was difficult to get medical professionals to provide such care at home because of the risk of complications and the fact that they would not be covered by insurance. \n \n Speaking after the hearing, Yates pleaded for any paediatric intensive care doctor to come forward to help them. She said: \u201cWe promised Charlie every day we would take him home. It seems really upsetting after everything we\u2019ve been through to deny us this.\u201d \n \n Gollop said Gosh had identified a hospice that was willing to take Charlie, which she said had been difficult given the publicity surrounding the case. But, as Yates wept and held her head in her hands, Armstrong said that although that was preferential to Charlie dying in hospital it would still be seen as \u201cbrutality\u201d if he were only there for a few hours. \n \n Describing it as \u201cthe most difficult, painful process for the parents\u201d, Mr Justice Francis urged the parties to resolve their differences outside the courtroom. \n \n Quick guide Charlie Gard and mitochondrial disease Show Hide What is wrong with Charlie Gard? Charlie has a very rare mitochondrial disease caused by a genetic defect inherited from his parents. The official diagnosis is infantile onset encephalomyopathic mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, referred to generally as \u201cMDDS\u201d. What is mitochondrial disease? Mitochondria supply energy to the cells in the human body. Mitochondrial failure leads to cellular injury and cell death. When multiple cells fail, the body\u2019s organs are damaged and shut down. These diseases are usually fatal and kill children, although sometimes they don\u2019t show up until adulthood. Where they don\u2019t kill, they cause serious permanent brain damage. What is the damage to Charlie? Charlie is in intensive care at Great Ormond Street hospital in London, the leading children\u2019s hospital in the UK. Life support machines are keeping him alive. The hospital says that he has severe brain damage, cannot move or breathe by himself, is deaf and has epilepsy. It says his heart, liver and kidneys are also affected. His eyelids cannot stay open and because of the weakness of the muscles, his eyes point in different directions and the damage to the brain will not allow his sight to develop. \n \n As it became apparent there was no prospect of that happening, he said given what he had heard about the need for an intensive care team, were he deciding the issue on the civil standard of proof he would rule out the prospect of Charlie being ventilated for days, whether in a hospice or at home. \n \n But he went on to say that \u201cgiven the gravity of the situation and the need to be as human as I can\u201d he would give Charlie\u2019s parents more time to make their case and make a final decision, in the absence of any unexpected developments, on Wednesday afternoon. \n \n At the end of the often acrimonious hearing, during which Butler-Cole told the court that the latest disagreement was a reflection of what happens when there was \u201csuch a fundamental breakdown in communications\u201d, Armstrong, who was in tears in court on Tuesday, angrily confronted Gollop. ||||| The mother of Charlie Gard has returned to the High Court as she and her husband fight for the terminally-ill baby to be allowed home to experience \"tranquility\" before he dies. \n \n Lawyers told a judge that Connie Yates and Chris Gard want a choice in \"the circumstances in which Charlie's passing will be conducted\" a day after they abandoned legal action over treatment for their son. \n \n Barrister Grant Armstrong, who represents the couple, said their \"final wish\" is to take Charlie home and indicated that Great Ormond Street Hospital doctors thought such a move would be problematic.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Charlie Gard's death seems inevitable, but what is yet to be decided is how it will occur, with the infant's parents and London's Great Ormond Street Hospital still at odds. A lawyer says Connie Yates and Chris Gard, who on Monday ended their legal battle to move their 11-month-old son to the US for experimental treatment of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, want to take Charlie home where he can die in \"tranquility\" after \"a short period of time,\" report the Telegraph and Reuters. In court on Tuesday, however, the lawyer cited \"difficulties the hospital has placed in the way of the parents' wish,\" per the Guardian, which notes Charlie had been expected to be taken off life support at the hospital within a few days. A rep countered that the hospital would be willing to grant the parents' request if \"practical, possible, and safe, and in Charlie's interests so that he comes to no harm.\" However, she says Charlie's parents have proposed no plan and the hospital is unable to provide a medical team to care for Charlie for the amount of time requested at home; the exact time requested isn't known, but Charlie's parents previously said the boy wasn't expected to live to see his first birthday on Aug. 4. The hospital rep also says Charlie's parents have refused mediation offers \"for reasons Great Ormond Street will never know.\" After hearing from both sides in High Court on Tuesday, the presiding judge suggested a settlement would be appropriate."

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n Sep. 19, 2017, 11:59 PM GMT / Updated Sep. 19, 2017, 11:59 PM GMT By Claire Atkinson \n \n The big five news organizations have passed on offering former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer a job as an exclusive paid contributor, network sources confirmed to NBC News on Tuesday. \n \n Since Spicer exited the White House, his representatives have been holding individual conversations about the possibility of President Donald Trump's former flack joining one of the major TV networks, which include CBS News, CNN, Fox News, ABC News and NBC News. \n \n But \"they won't touch him,\" said a media industry executive familiar with those conversations. \n \n \u201cThe news organizations might use him on roundtables, but [a paid exclusive contributor job] is not happening,\u201d the executive added. \n \n A number of network insiders who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect their business relationships said none of the networks were interested in hiring Spicer because of a \"lack of credibility.\" \n \n Representatives of the five news networks all declined to comment. Spicer and Robert Barnett, his representative, also declined to comment. \n \n CNN had already said it wasn\u2019t interested in him ahead of planned conversations, while Axios reported on Sept. 7 that Fox News would not be offering Spicer a TV contract. Fox News has previously hired the former White House press secretaries Ari Fleischer and Dana Perino. On Tuesday, sources with knowledge of the decisions confirmed that CBS News, ABC News and NBC News also would not offer him an exclusive role. \n \n A person familiar with Spicer\u2019s ongoing talks said that while conversations had not concluded, network punditry wasn\u2019t the most important measure of success and that Spicer may want more freedom to work for multiple outlets. There are also talks about a nonscripted reality show in the mix, said one person familiar with the situation. \n \n Meanwhile, there could also be interest in Spicer from other outlets. \n \n Spicer announced he was leaving the White House in July after news broke that Trump had appointed voluble Wall Street executive Anthony Scaramucci as communications director, and he formally departed in August. (Scaramucci was ousted after just 10 days after his appointment was announced.) One of Spicer\u2019s first moves was to hire Barnett, the veteran Washington politics and media lawyer. \n \n Spicer already has a role as a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School, and is signed with Worldwide Speakers Group for paid speaking engagements. The company website touts Spicer's ability to discuss \"the people, philosophies and policies that matter most to the citizens of the U.S. and businesses around the world.\u201d \n \n On Sunday, Spicer surprised the Emmy Awards audience by rolling out on a podium and describing the size of the crowd \u2014 a nod to both actress Melissa McCarthy's portrayal of him on \"Saturday Night Live\" and a reference to Spicer\u2019s incorrect contention that the president had attracted the \u201clargest audience to ever witness an inauguration, period,\u201d in January. \n \n When asked by The New York Times after the show if he regretted the way he had treated the press and their reporting on inauguration crowd size, he responded, \u201cOf course I do, absolutely.\u201d \n \n Spicer reportedly turned down an invitation to compete on ABC\u2019s \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d in August. ||||| Sean Spicer and Chelsea Manning are headed back to school.

Overall, the Packers-Falcons game was the highest-rated show of the week; the Emmys finished fourth. \n \n The awards show, hosted by progressive darling and late-night host Stephen Colbert, saw numerous zingers flung at the president and his administration, most prominently by Colbert himself, who quipped that Trump's presidency might have been avoided had he won an Emmy for his prior work on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" \n \n \"Why didn\u2019t you give him an Emmy?\" Colbert asked the star-studded crowd. \"I tell you this, if he had won an Emmy, I bet he wouldn\u2019t have run for president. So in a way this is all your fault.\" \n \n Morning Media Your guide to the media circus \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Alec Baldwin, meanwhile, notched the Emmy for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy for his imitations of Trump on \"Saturday Night Live\" \u2014 another program the president has mocked. \n \n Trump has repeatedly trashed the Emmys in the past. In 2014, Trump panned then-host Seth Meyers of NBC, whose performance he deemed \"terrible,\" adding on Twitter: \"Host Seth Meyers bombed!\" \n \n Host Stephen Colbert quipped Sunday that Donald Trump's presidency might have been avoided had he won an Emmy for his prior work on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\" | Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP \n \n The show also saw a return to the spotlight for former Trump press secretary Sean Spicer, who rolled out on a podium and mocked his now-infamous first outing at the press podium where he disputed graphic evidence disproving the administration's claim to have turned out the \"largest audience\" ever to a presidential inauguration. \n \n \u201cThis will be the largest audience to witness an Emmys, period,\u201d said Spicer, standing behind the lectern Melissa McCarthy used during her impersonations of him on NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d \u201cBoth in person and around the world.\u201d \n \n The president also appeared to praise his political base for being smarter that those tuning into Sunday's broadcast. \n \n \"Smartest people of them all are the 'DEPLORABLES,'\" Trump added on Tuesday. ||||| Stephen Colbert had the idea to invite Sean Spicer up on stage at the Emmys on Sunday night. He and his producers knew there would be blowback. And there's been a whole lot. \n \n But Colbert thought it would be funny and surprising, and that's what mattered most. \n \n Spicer scored points for comedy but sparked a raging debate: Should Colbert and the Emmys have given Spicer a platform to rehabilitate an image so badly tarnished by his brief stint working as President Trump's spokesman? \n \n Was Spicer \"in on the joke?\" Was he essentially admitting to lying to the American people from behind the White House podium? \n \n As the debate went on late Sunday night, Colbert was celebrating his first gig hosting the Emmys at a late-night party in Los Angeles. Spicer was there too, taking selfies with celebrities and gawkers. He seemed to revel in the attention. \n \n Related: Emmys 2017: The big moments that have people talking \n \n Spicer resigned from his job as White House press secretary in July and formally left the administration in August. Now he is hitting the speaker circuit, landing consulting gigs and looking for a potential TV commentator job. He will be a visiting fellow at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics this fall. \n \n Many Democrats and some anti-Trump Republicans are offended that Spicer -- who peddled misinformation on behalf of his boss -- is being embraced by institutions like Harvard. \n \n \"Harvard and the Emmys based on 7 months lying in the WH,\" former Obama foreign policy adviser Ben Rhodes tweeted. \"America is not exactly a meritocracy and false equivalence trumps reality.\" \n \n Some might see his Emmys appearance as an audition -- similar to his sit-down with Jimmy Kimmel on ABC last week. \n \n He stood behind a faux podium and told Colbert, \"This will be the largest audience to witness the Emmys, period -- both in person and around the world,\" poking fun at his false assertion about crowd size at President Trump's inauguration. \n \n Spicer's insistence that Trump had a record crowd, despite photographic evidence to the contrary, was the first of many incidents that eroded Spicer's credibility and made him into a punchline on \"SNL.\" \n \n His \"SNL\" impersonator, Melissa McCarthy, was in the audience during Sunday night's bit, furthering the idea that Spicer was winking at his reputation. \n \n The Emmys surprise came together just a few days before Sunday's telecast. Colbert wondered aloud if Spicer might play along, and one of his \"Late Show\" producers then pitched it, according to a source with firsthand knowledge of the skit. \n \n Spicer was already in Los Angeles for Kimmel's show last Wednesday. He briefly flew back east, to his home near Washington, then returned to Los Angeles for a secret dress rehearsal before the broadcast. \n \n The auditorium was almost entirely emptied before Spicer practiced his lines, the source said, so that his participation wouldn't leak ahead of time. \n \n The reveal went off without a hitch. From the live broadcast, it looked like the auditorium full of mostly liberal Hollywood celebrities lapped it up. There were laughs and lots of shocked faces. \n \n Within minutes, however, a wave of criticism crested on social media. Journalists, activists and celebrities said they didn't think it was funny to treat Spicer's mendacious behavior like a throwaway laugh line. \n \n The actor Zach Braff tweeted: \"I'm not ready to laugh 'with' Sean Spicer. I think he is an evil, opportunistic liar that hurt our country.\" \n \n The MSNBC host Lawrence O'Donnell commented that the Emmys \"helped Spicer pump up his 'lecture' fees, which is all that matters to him now.\" \n \n While many of the objections came from liberals, some conservatives also made arguments against the skit. \n \n \"I know people who were offered opportunities to lie for Donald Trump and quietly declined. Harvard & The Emmys calling the wrong folks,\" former Jeb Bush spokesman Tim Miller tweeted. \n \n Among the counter-arguments: It was just a joke. And besides, wasn't Spicer actually admitting to his and Trump's dishonesty through comedy? \n \n Colbert is an outspoken opponent of President Trump, and he doesn't fret about the perception that he's \"normalizing\" Spicer. \"Donald Trump normalized Spicer,\" a source involved in the production said. \n \n Spicer himself told The Hollywood Reporter that he hadn't considered the criticism his appearance might get. \"I was more worried about the logistical reactions,\" he told the magazine after the show. \"I've never wheeled a podium before. The one I'm used to is pretty stationary.\" \n \n Both sources who spoke with CNN on Monday morning marveled at the way Spicer was mobbed by Emmys attendees both at the awards show and at the parties afterward. \n \n \"He could barely eat at the Governor's Ball, he was so popular,\" one of the sources said. \n \n President Trump went from the entertainment world -- a hit show on NBC -- to politics. Now Spicer, a longtime spokesman for the Republican National Committee, is going in the other direction. \n \n The Hollywood Reporter's Chris Gardner described Spicer in the auditorium lobby during the show, \"posing for pics, drinking beer, soaking up all attention after onstage appearance.\"",
    "reference": "\u2013 The Emmys helped Sean Spicer \"rebrand,\" according to CNN\u2014but apparently not enough. The five major news networks have passed on the opportunity to have the former White House press secretary as an exclusive paid contributor, reports NBC News. Spicer's representatives had brought the proposal to CBS News, CNN, Fox News, ABC News, and NBC News, but none were receptive, NBC reports, citing insiders who referred to Spicer's \"lack of credibility.\" That doesn't mean Spicer won't be gracing your TV screens shortly. Insiders tell NBC that major networks may be willing to host him, just not exclusively. There might also be a Spicer reality show in the works, one source says. Spicer has already signed with Worldwide Speakers Group to manage his paid speaking engagements. He also has a gig as a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School, the New York Times previously reported. But even Harvard is taking flak. \"I know people who were offered opportunities to lie for Donald Trump and quietly declined. Harvard & The Emmys calling the wrong folks,\" Tim Miller, a former Jeb Bush spokesman, tweeted, per CNN. President Trump, meanwhile, took to Twitter late Tuesday to bash the Emmy ratings, which he called \"the worst ever,\" reports Politico. The show drew 11.4 million viewers, slightly more than the all-time low of 11.3 million in 2016."

Now, the Lamar High School senior is ready for college himself \u2014 and thanks to her example and a 4.68 GPA, he has more options than he ever imagined. \n \n Brown, a 17-year-old from Houston\u2019s Third Ward, applied to 20 colleges and universities, including four Ivy League schools. He\u2019s been accepted by every one, with a full ride to each and more than $260,000 in scholarships. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s surprising I was accepted to all of them,\u201d Brown said Sunday, a few days after the last of the acceptance emails rolled in. But his principal and counselors are not surprised at all. \n \n Now Playing: Now Playing Joshua Oglesby commits to Texas A&M; Kingsville - RB Media: Texan Live \n \n Leon O\u2019Neal Jr is \"Fixing to get things done\" at Texas A&M; Media: Texan Live \n \n 16-year-old trying out for Dynamo Media: Fox 26 Houston \n \n Students compete in regional robotics tournament Media: Fox4 \n \n UTA remembers Columbia shuttle astronaut Media: Fox4 \n \n Special Olympics Texas Winter Games Media: Fox7 \n \n 2018 Special Olympics Texas Winter Games Media: Fox7 \n \n 'Houston' song to raise money for HISD schools damaged by Hurricane Harvey Media: Fox 26 Houston \n \n Houston ISD board votes to rebuild four schools Media: Fox 26 Houston \n \n This Texas College is Offering Free Classes to Houston Residents Impacted by Hurricane Harvey Media: Southern Living \n \n Math contest in Central Texas Media: Fox7 \n \n READ ALSO: Rice's sticker price tops $60,000 \n \n Beyond the sky-high GPA, Brown is involved in a long list of extracurricular activities, including debate. He volunteers. And the future political science major is politically involved \u2014 most recently, he worked on Mayor Sylvester Turner\u2019s election campaign. \n \n Brown hasn\u2019t made a final decision yet, but he has narrowed his list to seven schools. \u201cIn no particular order,\u201d they are: Northwestern, Georgetown, Princeton, Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and Stanford. \n \n Every time a message from a college popped up, Brown said, \u201cI got nervous, because I don\u2019t think anyone ever wants to be rejected.\u201d \n \n READ ALSO: 25 well-paying jobs that don't require a degree \n \n But every time, the schools said yes \u2014 from Stanford to Princeton, Amherst to Vanderbilt, Johns Hopkins to the University of Texas at Austin. \n \n It\u2019s not privilege or money that put Brown on the radar of so many selective schools. \n \n \u201cIf you look strictly at statistics and demographics, then the cards were stacked against him,\u201d said Lamar principal James McSwain. The teen\u2019s success is an example, he said, of what can happen \u201cwhen the forces line up the right way\u201d \u2014 when kids are given opportunity, support and good direction. \n \n The Houston ISD student has benefited from several college prep programs, including EMERGE, which started in HISD and has now spread to Spring and Spring Branch ISDs. EMERGE offers workshops, guidance, college visits and test prep to help kids from underserved communities find their way to some of the best schools in the country. \n \n Low-income kids have trouble finding their own way to top colleges, said EMERGE founder Rick Cruz. \u201cThe kids have a drive \u2014 they have the desire \u2014 but they don\u2019t necessarily know how to access these types of opportunities.\u201d \n \n Brown says he got serious about college toward the end of his ninth-grade year. \n \n \u201cI got very serious about finding ways to get extra-involved in my community and be prepared for college admissions when I got older,\u201d he said. He \u201cfell in love\u201d with debate his sophomore year, got involved in political activism \u2014 it was simply a matter of \u201cfinding what I enjoy doing and doing those things well.\u201d \n \n Norman Clark II, an EMERGE academic program director, started working with Brown in his junior year. From the beginning, he saw a focused, smart student with a strong sense of who he was and where he wanted to go. \n \n \u201cHe was already on that top-tier track,\u201d Clark said. \u201cBut this program sort of helped to expedite the process.\u201d \n \n Brown gives his mom, Berthinia Rutledge-Brown, much of the credit for his success. \n \n \u201cAfter she got divorced, she decided she needed to get a better job,\u201d he said. Rutledge-Brown enrolled at Houston Community College and worked hard to become a licensed counselor when Brown was 8 or 9 years old. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s the first time I understood what going to college might look like,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd seeing how important it was to my mom was important to me. I don\u2019t even think she really knew that I saw, that it had an impact on me \u2014 but it did.\u201d \n \n She\u2019s still showing him how to strive, Brown said; she now works two jobs as a chemical dependency counselor. \n \n \u201cThe best lesson she taught me was through her actions and her working hard and dedicating herself \u2014 just doing what she tells me I should do.\u201d \n \n Brown is not the first area teen to excel at college admissions. Just last year, Alief ISD student Amina Mabizari was accepted by seven of the Ivy League\u2019s eight schools. \n \n McSwain said these stories are extreme examples of how students across the area are \u201cmaking something of themselves\u201d and finding opportunity. \n \n \u201cEducation is the great equalizer in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cIt enables you to move up and down socially. Education enables you to become something that maybe you never dreamed you could become.\u201d \n \n Brown predicts that his final college decision will be between Harvard and Stanford. He\u2019ll visit both campuses and make a decision by the May 1 deadline. But Clark, the EMERGE program director, doesn\u2019t want him to rush. \n \n \u201cHe could throw a dart at any of the schools and he\u2019s going to be just fine, so there\u2019s no pressure coming from me,\u201d Clark said. \u201cHe has a track record of making great decisions. Now it\u2019s up to Micheal.\u201d ||||| (CNN) Micheal Brown stared at the acceptance letter in front of him: It said yes. \n \n So did the next one. And the one after that. \n \n The 17-year-old from Houston applied to 20 of the best universities in the US. He was admitted to every single one with a full ride and $260,000 in additional scholarship offers. \n \n \"It's something I'm proud of because I see my hard work paying off, determination paying off, sacrifices paying off,\" the student told CNN. \n \n Of those 20, he listed his top eight choices as: Harvard, Princeton, Northwestern, Yale, University of Pennsylvania, Stanford, Georgetown and Vanderbilt. \n \n Currently a senior at Mirabeau B. Lamar High School, Micheal has been heavily involved in his school's debate team, mock trial and student government for years. He has also volunteered for political campaigns, citing his interest to \"the moment I saw Barack Obama get elected.\" \n \n He is set on majoring in political science, but is also considering a second degree in economics. \n \n The first letter \n \n When he received his first acceptance in December, he chose to do it at a friend's house to relieve the pressure of being around his whole family. \n \n \"My family had high expectations and maybe didn't realize how competitive the process is,\" he said. \n \n But he still invited his biggest supporter to come along -- his mom. \n \n Berthinia Rutledge-Brown filmed as Micheal stood in shock by the computer while his friends excitedly rallied around him. \n \n Stanford, of course, said yes. \n \n \"After sixth grade, Mike was in control of his education,\" recalled the proud mom. \"He was focused, he knew what he wanted and he made his own decisions.\" \n \n A mother's dedication \n \n Rutledge-Brown lost three babies before becoming pregnant with Micheal.

    "input": "Animals are endowed with the capacity to repair injuries. In this study, we found that, upon amputation, the moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita rearranges existing body parts and recovers radial symmetry within a few days. This unique strategy of self-repair, which we call symmetrization, requires mechanical forces generated by the muscle-based propulsion machinery. We observed a similar strategy in a number of other jellyfish species. This finding may contribute to understanding the evolutionary pressures governing biological self-repair strategies. Beyond biology, this finding may inspire a mechanically driven, self-organizing machinery that recovers essential geometry without regenerating precise forms. \n \n Abstract \n \n What happens when an animal is injured and loses important structures? Some animals simply heal the wound, whereas others are able to regenerate lost parts. In this study, we report a previously unidentified strategy of self-repair, where moon jellyfish respond to injuries by reorganizing existing parts, and rebuilding essential body symmetry, without regenerating what is lost. Specifically, in response to arm amputation, the young jellyfish of Aurelia aurita rearrange their remaining arms, recenter their manubria, and rebuild their muscular networks, all completed within 12 hours to 4 days. We call this process symmetrization. We find that symmetrization is not driven by external cues, cell proliferation, cell death, and proceeded even when foreign arms were grafted on. Instead, we find that forces generated by the muscular network are essential. Inhibiting pulsation using muscle relaxants completely, and reversibly, blocked symmetrization. Furthermore, we observed that decreasing pulse frequency using muscle relaxants slowed symmetrization, whereas increasing pulse frequency by lowering the magnesium concentration in seawater accelerated symmetrization. A mathematical model that describes the compressive forces from the muscle contraction, within the context of the elastic response from the mesoglea and the ephyra geometry, can recapitulate the recovery of global symmetry. Thus, self-repair in Aurelia proceeds through the reorganization of existing parts, and is driven by forces generated by its own propulsion machinery. We find evidence for symmetrization across species of jellyfish (Chrysaora pacifica, Mastigias sp., and Cotylorhiza tuberculata). ||||| View Images Moon jellyfish (pictured at the Vancouver Aquarium) can restore their symmetry within four days. \n \n Photograph by Joel Sartore, National Geographic \n \n In the spring of 2013, biologist Michael Abrams had cut two arms off a young jellyfish when he witnessed something he'd never seen before. \n \n \"He started yelling... 'You won't believe this, you've got to come here and see what's happening,'\" recalls his Ph.D. advisor Lea Goentoro , a biologist at Caltech in Pasadena. \n \n The team expected that Abrams' moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) had regrown its limbs, since many other marine invertebrates \u2014including the polyp stage of moon jellyfish\u2014regenerate themselves this way. (See \" Pictures: 5 Animals That Regrow Body Parts .\") \n \n Instead, the moon jelly had rearranged its six remaining arms until they were evenly placed around the body. Muscles in the jellyfish's body had pushed and pulled on the remaining arms until they were once again evenly spaced. Being symmetrical is crucial for moon jellyfish movement. \n \n The scientists had stumbled upon a phenomenon completely new to science, which they call \"symmetrization.\" Because jellyfish often suffer from injuries\u2014sometimes inflicted by unsuccessful predators\u2014symmetrization is an important method to heal themselves. \n \n \"This is an amazing study and a fantastic piece of detective work,\" says Sara Lindsay , a marine biologist at the University of Maine, who was not involved with the study. \n \n Flexing Muscles \n \n Goentoro and colleagues could have easily missed their discovery: They had originally set out to study limb repair in Turritopsis dohrnii, also known as the immortal jellyfish . While they waited for specimens to arrive, the scientists practiced their experimental techniques on the much more common moon jelly. \n \n After observing the jellyfish putting themselves back together, \"I repeated the experiments several times because I thought I might have made a mistake,\" Abrams says. (See jellyfish pictures from the National Geographic archives .) \n \n Watch a video of jellyfish in their natural habitat. \n \n Dance of the Jellyfish De-stress and drift into space with these hypnotic and exotic creatures. Pure escapism for the soul. \n \n \n \n \n \n Once he had reassured himself that the jellyfish really was rearranging its arms to restore symmetry\u2014a process which takes between 12 hours to 4 days\u2014Abrams and his team had to figure out how the animal manages such a feat. \n \n After several false starts, the researchers focused on the jellyfish's musculature. Giving the moon jellies a muscle relaxant made them unable to complete the symmetrization process. On the other hand, when the team increased the muscular pulses of the juvenile jellyfish, the process occurred faster than usual. \n \n This suggests that the muscles push against each other to get the arms as widely spaced as possible. \n \n \"It's like squeezing one side of a stress ball and you get a protrusion on the other side,\" says Goentoro, whose study appeared June 15 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n He started yelling... 'You won't believe this, you've got to come here and see what's happening.' Lea Goentoro, Caltech biologist \n \n Back on Track \n \n Restoring symmetry is crucial to the marine animals: Asymmetrical jellyfish have difficulties propelling themselves through the water and feeding properly. A jellyfish can lose a limb due to predators. \n \n View Images Moon jellyfish (pictured, animals from the Toledo Zoo) are common in the world's oceans. \n \n Photograph by Joel Sartore, National Geographic \n \n It's like a car: Remove one wheel and you won't be able to drive it. But if you shift the remaining wheel from the side of the vehicle into the center, the car will once again be able to move about, the researchers say. \n \n \"This isn't replacing lost parts, it's replacing their function. That's pretty cool,\" Lindsay says. \n \n Goentoro adds that understanding the newly discovered phenomenon could provide new insight for scientists studying regenerative medicine. (Related: \"Will We Ever Regenerate Limbs?\") \n \n \"We hope it will inspire new technology for biomaterials\u2014not by regenerating what was lost, but by restoring function,\" she says.",

But no. \"[Abrams] started yelling... 'You won't believe this, you've got to come here and see what's happening,'\" his PhD adviser Lea Goentoro tells National Geographic. Reporting this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Abrams says he watched the jellyfish, which relies on being symmetrical to move about, not regenerate the missing arms but rather rearrange its remaining six limbs so that they were symmetrical again. The phenomenon, dubbed symmetrization, has never before been observed in nature, and Abrams was floored. The jellyfish was using its own muscles to push and pull on its remaining six arms to space them out evenly again. (They confirmed this by observing that muscle relaxants made the jellies unable to rearrange their arms, while increasing muscular pulses allowed them to rearrange their arms faster.) And the discovery was accidental; Abrams and his team had only been cutting into the common moon jellyfish to practice for their future study on what are called immortal jellyfish, which had yet to arrive in the lab. They've since observed symmetrization in moon jellies many times, and it takes anywhere from 12 hours to four days to complete.

Snowden, the former National Security Agency contractor who provided journalists a trove of classified documents, retained a well-known Washington defense lawyer last summer in hopes of reaching a plea deal with federal prosecutors that would allow him to return to the United States and spare him significant prison time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The lawyer, according to people familiar with the investigation, is Plato Cacheris, who has represented defendants in some of the highest-profile cases involving Espionage Act charges, including the convicted spies Aldrich Ames and Robert Hanssen and the convicted leaker Lawrence Franklin. \n \n But nearly a year after Mr. Cacheris became involved, no agreement appears imminent, and government officials said the negotiations remained at an early stage. \n \n The officials and others who discussed the case and Mr. Cacheris\u2019s involvement in it spoke on condition of anonymity, citing the sensitivity of the talks. \n \n Mr. Snowden, who now lives in Moscow, where he received temporary asylum, was charged last year with multiple violations of the Espionage Act. He faces up to 30 years in prison, and prosecutors could easily add more counts. \n \n In a phone call, Mr. Cacheris said only: \u201cIt\u2019s not something that I want to discuss, so I have no comment.\u201d \n \n Mr. Snowden\u2019s revelations about the breadth and intrusiveness of the N.S.A.\u2019s surveillance prompted the first major reconsideration of the government\u2019s surveillance powers since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. President Obama has said he wants to stop the N.S.A.\u2019s collection of every American\u2019s phone records, a program that was the subject of the first news article based on Mr. Snowden\u2019s documents. But Mr. Obama and other administration officials have said Mr. Snowden should return to the United States to face prosecution. \n \n Mr. Snowden has said that he wants to live somewhere other than Russia, but that American diplomatic pressure is preventing him from traveling or obtaining asylum elsewhere. Still, as long as he can live indefinitely under asylum in Russia, he appears unlikely to strike a deal that would require a lengthy prison sentence. \n \n \u201cSnowden is interested in returning home,\u201d said Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who also represents Mr. Snowden. \u201cHe is and always has been on America\u2019s side. He would cooperate in extraordinary ways in the right circumstances. But he does not believe that the \u2018felon\u2019 label is the right word for someone whose act of conscience has revitalized democratic oversight of the intelligence community and is leading to historic reforms.\u201d \n \n Prosecutors have signaled no interest in giving Mr. Snowden credit for the surveillance debate he started. \n \n \u201cHe is accused of leaking classified information, and there is no question his actions have inflicted serious harms on our national security,\u201d said Marc Raimondi, a Justice Department spokesman. He said Mr. Snowden was not a whistle-blower. \n \n Any deal could depend on what information Mr. Snowden could give in return. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n In December, Richard Ledgett, who was then the National Security Agency official leading the response to the leaks and has since become the agency\u2019s deputy director, floated the idea of a deal in which Mr. Snowden would receive leniency in exchange for returning documents in his possession that he had not disclosed. \n \n \u201cI would need assurances that the remainder of the data could be secured, and my bar for those assurances would be very high,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would be more than just an assertion on his part.\u201d \n \n It is not clear whether Mr. Ledgett was suggesting an outcome in which Mr. Snowden persuaded journalists to destroy or return the documents, or whether the government believed Mr. Snowden had kept back documents to use as leverage. \n \n Mr. Snowden has repeatedly said he did not bring any documents to Russia. He recently told Vanity Fair that there was no \u201cdoomsday cache\u201d in his possession, saying, \u201cWho would set up a system that incentivizes others to kill them?\u201d \n \n Even if he has no documents to return, Mr. Snowden could also help the N.S.A. by providing an accounting of what he took. Despite government claims that Mr. Snowden may have taken 1.7 million documents, Mr. Snowden also told Vanity Fair that figure is \u201ca scare number based on an intentionally crude metric: everything that I ever digitally interacted with in my career.\u201d \n \n Mr. Ledgett confirmed to Vanity Fair that the N.S.A. did not know what he had taken. \n \n Some leaks cases have ended with charges less than a felony, and Mr. Wizner\u2019s remarks suggest that Mr. Snowden wants something similar. Thomas Drake, a former N.S.A. executive accused of leaking about waste and mismanagement to The Baltimore Sun, was charged under the Espionage Act with mishandling classified documents. He settled his case in 2011 for a misdemeanor guilty plea and served no prison time. \n \n Several other leak cases under the Obama administration have resulted in deals for roughly two or three years in prison. At the far end of the spectrum, Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Pfc. Bradley Manning, who leaked documents to WikiLeaks, was sentenced by a military court last year to 35 years in prison. \n \n Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor and a Columbia University law professor, said the first step toward a deal is hiring someone like Mr. Cacheris \u2014 \u201ca lawyer whom the government can trust and has familiarity with.\u201d \n \n Mr. Cacheris previously represented Mr. Franklin, a Pentagon analyst who was prosecuted under the administration of George W. Bush for leaking classified information about Iran to pro-Israel lobbyists, who in turn were accused of passing it to journalists. \n \n Mr. Franklin pleaded guilty in 2005 and was initially sentenced to nearly 13 years in prison. In 2009, a judge reduced the sentence to 10 months of community confinement. \n \n In 2001, Mr. Cacheris represented Mr. Hanssen, an F.B.I. agent charged with spying for the Soviet Union and Russia. He negotiated a plea deal for a life sentence, sparing Mr. Hanssen the death penalty and allowing his wife to collect part of his pension. \n \n In 1994, Mr. Cacheris represented Mr. Ames, a Central Intelligence Agency officer charged with being a Russian agent. Mr. Cacheris negotiated a deal for a life sentence for Mr. Ames and a lighter sentence for Mr. Ames's wife for aiding his spying. \n \n But Mr. Snowden\u2019s negotiations will face steep hurdles, Mr. Richman said, because even if he can offer something, the government will want a punishment that deters future leakers. \n \n \u201cIf there isn\u2019t a deal,\u201d Mr. Richman said, \u201cit\u2019s an unfortunate but relatively stable thing for him to be in Russia for the rest of his life with an American indictment standing against him.\u201d ||||| According to The New York Times, last summer, as Edward Snowden maneuvered around the globe seeking asylum, the former NSA contractor retained a lawyer famous for handling cases involving the Espionage Act.

Alex wanted to know. He would study the product. He would study the substances.

He would study the substances.' \n \n The \u201c60 Minutes\u201d report will also delve into the relationship between Rodriguez and Bosch, whose validation of as many as 500 Blackberry messages between the men was the linchpin of MLB\u2019s case and a large basis of arbitrator Fredric Horowitz\u2019s ruling. Bosch knew Rodriguez\u2019s proclivities, his habits, his behavior, his desire to win \u2014 and not get caught. \n \n The Daily News has also obtained text messages that describe a secretive Rodriguez and an accommodating Bosch, who often delivered the substances to Rodriguez at his home or his hotel. \n \n \u201cTry to use service elevators. Careful. Tons of eyes,\u201d Rodriguez told Bosch in one Blackberry BBM message the day before he hit his 23rd grand slam, tying Lou Gehrig\u2019s record in June 2012 in Atlanta. \n \n In a spring training game in April 2012, in which he drove in three runs, A-Rod texted Bosch with what they both appeared to believe was good news. \n \n A-ROD: \u201cReally good. Explosive.\u201d \n \n ERIK S.

And frankly, nobody came in and contradicted what Mr. Bosch said.\u201d ||||| By turning to Tony Bosch to help them make a case against Alex Rodriguez in the Biogenesis investigation, Major League Baseball has become a safe house. Bosch feared for his life, CBS reporter Scott Pelley of \"60 Minutes\" says he was told, because associates of A-Rod threatened Bosch's life after failing to bribe him. So he turned to MLB for protection. \n \n Bosch also told \"60 Minutes,\" Pelley says, that he developed and administered a PED program, supplying six banned substances to Rodriguez and personally injecting him sometimes because A-Rod feared needles. \n \n Arbitrator Fredric Horowitz ruled Saturday that Rodriguez must sit out all of the 2014 season, including any postseason the New York Yankees might play. Rodriguez had appealed MLB's original suspension of 211 games, the longest in league history short of a lifetime ban. Rodriguez claims he hasn't used PEDs in a decade. \n \n A \"lengthy interview\" with Bosch will be broadcast in full Sunday night that gets into \"all of the specifics\" of Bosch's relationship with Rodriguez. Here are the details to expect, Pelley says: \n \n \n \n \n \n Bosch claims that associates of Rodriguez attempted to bribe him to stay quiet. When that didn't work, he says they attempted to get him out of the country, and when that didn't work, he says, he started getting death threats. \n \n He was afraid for his life, he tells us in the interview, and that drove him into the arms of Major League Baseball. Baseball told him that they would protect him, would give him security and would defend him legally. \n \n It's hard to imagine Major League Baseball turning into a witness relocation program, harboring Bosch and \"protecting\" him from associates of A-Rod who allegedly threatened his life. Did the commissioner open up his Milwaukee home to Bosch to keep him out of harm's way from A-Rod's alleged hitmen? It sounds absurd, but what about this story doesn't? Also: If MLB is paying Bosch's way, it's clear that it's OK with him speaking to CBS. Bosch is telling the story it wants told, that A-Rod would do anything to save his hide, to be used against him later if necessary. \n \n Bosch tells CBS a different story than he did earlier in a previous interview. Bosch denied to ESPN using his Biogenesis clinic to supply PEDs to MLB players, saying media reports about him weren't true. Instead, he claimed to be just a nutritionist. The New Times of Miami broke the story about a year ago that A-Rod and other MLB players got PEDs from Biogenesis, a now-shuttered clinic in South Florida that advertised itself as a chemical fountain of youth. Later, Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers was linked to the clinic, and it resulted in him serving a 65-game suspension at the end of the 2013 season. \n \n Back in August, \"60 Minutes\" reported that A-Rod had leaked Biogenesis documents implicating Braun and others to the media, including Yahoo Sports. \n \n Of course, when A-Rod goes to court, he's going to try and make Bosch look like the worst witness in history. It might not be enough to get A-Rod's suspension overturned \u2014 and it didn't sway Horowitz much \u2014 but Bosch has shown that he can't exactly be trusted. \n \n And there's still at least one or two pieces of this puzzle missing. Assuming what Bosch says is true, are we to believe A-Rod couldn't conjure enough money to bribe him? Perhaps Bosch believes that MLB can help protect him from prosecution in U.S. courts, but it's hard to figure how MLB would have any sway there. \n \n Meanwhile, with A-Rod saying he's still going to spring training at Tampa in five weeks\u2014 and the Yankees still owing him three more seasons and $61 million \u2014 it's anybody's guess what happens next in this soap opera. \n \n - - - - - - - \n \n Follow @AnswerDave ||||| 60 Minutes will offer the first look at the details in the doping case of Yankee slugger Alex Rodriguez, including interviews with Major League Baseball's chief witness against him, Anthony Bosch - who says he injected Rodriguez with banned substances - and the league's COO Rob Manfred. Scott Pelley's report will be broadcast Sunday, Jan. 12 (8:00-9:00 PM, ET/PT) on the CBS Television Network. \n \n Rodriguez's 211-game suspension from MLB was lowered by an arbitrator today to 162 games, plus any 2014 playoff games. He has denied using banned drugs as a Yankee and has never tested positive for a banned substance since he joined the New York team. But Bosch's charges, many used in MLB's decision to suspend Rodriguez, include that: \n \n -He personally delivered banned substances, including testosterone, insulin-like growth factor 1 and human growth hormone to Rodriguez at least a dozen times and Rodriguez paid him $12,000 a month in cash. \n \n -He personally injected Rodriguez because \"Alex is scared of needles, so at times, he would ask me to inject.\" \n \n -Rodriguez's mission was to hit 800 home runs and that the Yankee slugger asked him for what he gave MLB superstar Manny Ramirez, a former Bosch client \n \n -Text messages obtained by 60 Minutes between him and Rodriguez indicate that at times they communicated daily about the substances the slugger took on his \"protocol\" \n \n -Says Rodriguez associates intimidated him to try to prevent him from cooperating with MLB in its investigation of the Yankee third baseman. \n \n MLB's Manfred tells Pelley that he believes the threats Bosch says he received could be legitimate. \"The concerns seemed credible, particularly given that he identified individuals that we had our own concerns about.\" \n \n But Bosch once denied he ever gave anyone performance enhancing drugs. Manfred and MLB dropped a lawsuit against him and are now paying for security guards and have agreed to cover his legal fees in return for his cooperation. In Rodriguez's own lawsuit against MLB, he charges that this arrangement is essentially a $5 million bribe, which Manfred says is \"absolutely untrue.\" \n \n Pressed by Pelley that the security and legal fee arrangement is plenty of incentive for Bosch to lie, potentially undermining his credibility, Manfred responds, \"The credibility of any witness is determined by \u2026 looking the individual in the eye, listening to the story he tells and then lining it up with the other evidence,\" he tells Pelley. \"And frankly, nobody came in and contradicted what Mr. Bosch said.\" \n \n Rodriguez turned down numerous requests for an interview with 60 Minutes.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Refusing to accept bribes from Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez is dangerous business, according to Tony Bosch. The man who allegedly supplied Rodriguez with PEDs and cooperated with a Major League Baseball investigation into the matter tells 60 Minutes that he received death threats after Rodriguez associates failed to bribe him, reports CBS News and Yahoo Sports. Among his other allegations: Bosch would sometimes administer the drugs to Rodriguez: \"Alex is scared of needles, so at times, he would ask me to inject.\" The drugs included human growth hormone and testosterone, which Bosch delivered to A-Rod personally at least a dozen times. Bosch's payment: $12,000 monthly, in cash. A-Rod's goal was to hit 800 home runs and surpass what the New York Daily News calls \"the game's most hallowed statistic,\" Barry Bonds' 762 home runs. Bosch turned to MLB for protection after receiving the death threats. A-Rod's lawsuit against MLB says Bosch's protection program is basically a $5 million bribe, which league COO Rob Manfred calls \"absolutely untrue.\" The 60 Minutes segment looks closely at damning text messages exchanged between Bosch and the slugger. But it leaves two questions unanswered, notes Yahoo Sports: How is it that multi-millionaire Rodriguez was unable to bribe Bosch? And does Bosch think MLB can protect him in US courts, where it has basically no influence?"

The same process will happen at Lake Needwood, where he said counts have found between 20 and 50 geese. \n \n The program as approved allows for the removal of up to 300 geese, though Petersen said he expects the number of geese to be rounded up and killed to be between 100 and 150. The goose meat from the processing plant will be donated to the Maryland Food Bank. It will be the first time Montgomery Parks has used the method of collecting the birds and taking them to a processing facility. \n \n \u201cThis hasn\u2019t been something that we\u2019re jumping to do,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cThe problems at these parks go back years and years. We\u2019ve been doing other management efforts, but again as we\u2019ve seen other entities successfully use this technique, it kind of just surfaced as the next step.\u201d \n \n Lynsey White Dasher, director of humane wildlife conflict resolution with the Humane Society, said the lethal method for dealing with geese is inhumane and often ineffective. \n \n \u201cThese round up and killing programs for geese are not effective because they simply leave open empty attractable habitat,\u201d Dasher said, \u201cand that habitat will be refilled by geese coming in from nearby areas.\u201d \n \n She encouraged Montgomery Parks to implement a program of other techniques throughout the year, including egg addling, hiring companies with dogs to chase the geese away and allowing grass and vegetation to grow higher immediately around lakes and ponds. \n \n Via Montgomery Parks, the two locations where the geese roundups are set to take place. \n \n Geese are known to prefer lakes and ponds with mowed grass edges, since it allows them to more easily look out for predators during the molting season. That\u2019s part of the reason why geese are known to frequent parks with athletic playing fields and golf courses, Petersen and Dasher said. \n \n Petersen said Parks has tried those other techniques, including egg addling, in which people paint over goose eggs with corn oil so the eggs can\u2019t hatch. The Humane Society considers that method more humane than rounding up adult geese and killing them. \n \n He also said the department has repeatedly tried to get park patrons to stop feeding the animals, something else that attracts them to the areas. \n \n \u201cWe do want to recognize that [Montgomery Parks] seems to be making some effort, but we certainly feel they could expand these humane efforts and we would be happy to help them design and implement a humane Canada geese management program,\u201d Dasher said. \n \n Petersen said Parks expects the roundup program to significantly decrease the geese populations in the two parks, though he left open the possibility the department would have to conduct similar programs in the future. \n \n \u201cIt absolutely reduces the population,\u201d Petersen said. \u201cThat\u2019s been shown not only around the region, but around the country. This has been used for decades as a way to reduce the impacts. I don\u2019t foresee the same number or more geese coming back the following season.\u201d \n \n The operation has approval from Parks Director Michael Riley and a permit required by the federal government. Parks staff and its contractor will use small, temporary fences to round up the geese, which will then be put into crates and transported to the processor, where they will be slaughtered and the meat packaged for the food bank. \n \n Petersen said the project will cost Parks about $20 per goose. ||||| Montgomery County, Maryland, believes they have an uncommon solution to a bird problem in their county parks. \n \n Montgomery Parks plans to round up between 100 to 150 geese that have been creating safety issues in the facilities and humanely euthanize them. The animals will be processed and the meat will be donated to the Maryland Food Bank. \n \n \u201cThese geese are year-round residents and create multiple issues for park users and staff. The excessive feces they leave, up to one pound daily, is not only unsightly but causes unsanitary conditions around bodies of water, docks, pathways, athletic fields and lawn areas,\u201d Dave Petersen, Natural Resources Specialist for Montgomery Parks, said in a press release. \n \n The park service has already tried different, non-lethal methods to get rid of the geese, including a ban on feeding them, habitat manipulation, fencing and repelling devices. Those methods have worked in some parks, but other parks, including the Martin Luther King Jr., Recreational Park and Rock Creek Regional Park, continue to have a problem with too many geese. \n \n A federally permitted wildlife contractor will do the geese removal. WTOP Radio reported The Humane Society of the United States has voiced its concern over the plans and would prefer the park system exhaust every non-lethal type of management. \n \n \u201cFor us, it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve used this method, but it is by no means unprecedented in our area,\u201d Peterson told WTOP. ||||| Geese will be humanely euthanized, processed and donated to the Maryland Food Bank. \n \n SILVER SPRING, MD\u2014Montgomery Parks, part of the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission is launching a geese removal project at two park sites, Martin Luther King, Jr. Recreational Park and Rock Creek Regional Park. The project will take place this June and up to 300 geese will be removed and humanely euthanized. The animals will then be processed for human consumption and the meat donated to the Maryland Food Bank. \n \n \u201cThese geese are year-round residents and create multiple issues for park users and staff. The excessive feces they leave, up to one pound daily, is not only unsightly but causes unsanitary conditions around bodies of water, docks, pathways, athletic fields and lawn areas,\u201d said Dave Petersen, Natural Resources Specialist for Montgomery Parks. \n \n Other negative impacts from the geese include turf damage, shoreline erosion, aggressive and potentially dangerous behavior during nesting season, and public safety hazards on roads. \n \n The Department of Parks has already implemented a number of measures to reduce negative impacts from geese, including a ban on feeding them, habitat manipulation, exclusion fencing, egg-oiling / addling and repelling devices. While these methods have proven beneficial at some park locations, they have not been sufficient to alleviate the impacts at Martin Luther King, Jr., Recreational Park and Rock Creek Regional Park. \n \n The geese removal is being conducted by a federally permitted wildlife contractor in cooperation with Montgomery Parks\u2019 Natural Resources Stewardship staff. Similar removal efforts have been conducted on both public and private land throughout the region. \n \n For more information please visit www.parksnaturalresources.org \n \n About The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission Montgomery Parks: \n \n Montgomery Parks manages more than 36,000 acres of parkland, consisting of 417 parks.

Per a press release, up to 300 geese are to be \"humanely euthanized\" at both Martin Luther King Jr. Recreational Park and Rock Creek Regional Park, \"processed for human consumption,\" and the meat given to the Maryland Food Bank, though a Montgomery Parks rep tells Bethesda Magazine the number will probably be more like 100 to 150. \"These geese are year-round residents and create multiple issues for park users and staff,\" David Petersen says. \"The excessive feces they leave, up to one pound daily, is not only unsightly but causes unsanitary conditions.\" He also tells WTOP that geese protective of their offspring have been known to attack people, and that their grazing damages turf and grass. Petersen says that the gathering of the geese, which will run the parks department about $20 per bird, will take place through the end of June and into mid-July and stresses that it wasn't an easy decision to put the geese down, especially after criticism from the Humane Society. \"These roundup and killing programs for geese are not effective because they simply leave open empty attractable habitat, and that habitat will be refilled by geese coming in from nearby areas,\" a Humane Society director tells Bethesda Magazine. Petersen rebuts that, noting to WTOP that the parks department has been tapping into other, nonlethal methods \"for a number of years\" and that \"all these things have been marginally effective.\" He also points out it's not an unusual method to get rid of pesky fowl, noting everyone from homeowners associations to federal agencies have gone this route.

Scientists from around the world have gathered in Stockholm in September... (Associated Press) \n \n FILE - Smoke pours from a chimney at a cement plant in Binzhou city, in eastern China's Shandong province, Thursday, Jan. 17, 2013. Scientists from around the world have gathered in Stockholm in September... (Associated Press) \n \n Top scientists from a variety of fields say they are about as certain that global warming is a real, man-made threat as they are that cigarettes kill. \n \n They are as sure about climate change as they are about the age of the universe. They say they are more certain about climate change than they are that vitamins make you healthy or that dioxin in Superfund sites is dangerous. \n \n They'll even put a number on how certain they are about climate change. But that number isn't 100 percent. It's 95 percent. \n \n And for some non-scientists, that's just not good enough. \n \n There's a mismatch between what scientists say about how certain they are and what the general public thinks the experts mean, experts say. \n \n That is an issue because this week, scientists from around the world have gathered in Stockholm for a meeting of a U.N. panel on climate change, and they will probably issue a report saying it is \"extremely likely\" _ which they define in footnotes as 95 percent certain _ that humans are mostly to blame for temperatures that have climbed since 1951. \n \n One climate scientist involved says the panel may even boost it in some places to \"virtually certain\" and 99 percent. \n \n Some climate-change deniers have looked at 95 percent and scoffed. After all, most people wouldn't get on a plane that had only a 95 percent certainty of landing safely, risk experts say. \n \n But in science, 95 percent certainty is often considered the gold standard for certainty. \n \n \"Uncertainty is inherent in every scientific judgment,\" said Johns Hopkins University epidemiologist Thomas Burke. \"Will the sun come up in the morning?\" Scientists know the answer is yes, but they can't really say so with 100 percent certainty because there are so many factors out there that are not quite understood or under control. \n \n George Gray, director of the Center for Risk Science and Public Health at George Washington University, said that demanding absolute proof on things such as climate doesn't make sense. \n \n \"There's a group of people who seem to think that when scientists say they are uncertain, we shouldn't do anything,\" said Gray, who was chief scientist for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency during the George W. Bush administration. \"That's crazy. We're uncertain and we buy insurance.\" \n \n With the U.N. panel about to weigh in on the effects of greenhouse gas emissions from the burning of oil, coal and gas, The Associated Press asked scientists who specialize in climate, physics, epidemiology, public health, statistics and risk just what in science is more certain than human-caused climate change, what is about the same, and what is less. \n \n They said gravity is a good example of something more certain than climate change. Climate change \"is not as sure as if you drop a stone it will hit the Earth,\" Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said. \"It's not certain, but it's close.\" \n \n Arizona State University physicist Lawrence Krauss said the 95 percent quoted for climate change is equivalent to the current certainty among physicists that the universe is 13.8 billion years old. \n \n The president of the prestigious National Academy of Sciences, Ralph Cicerone, and more than a dozen other scientists contacted by the AP said the 95 percent certainty regarding climate change is most similar to the confidence scientists have in the decades' worth of evidence that cigarettes are deadly. \n \n \"What is understood does not violate any mechanism that we understand about cancer,\" while \"statistics confirm what we know about cancer,\" said Cicerone, an atmospheric scientist. Add to that a \"very high consensus\" among scientists about the harm of tobacco, and it sounds similar to the case for climate change, he said. \n \n But even the best study can be nitpicked because nothing is perfect, and that's the strategy of both tobacco defenders and climate deniers, said Stanton Glantz, a medicine professor at the University of California, San Francisco and director of its tobacco control research center. \n \n George Washington's Gray said the 95 percent number the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change will probably adopt may not be realistic. In general, regardless of the field of research, experts tend to overestimate their confidence in their certainty, he said. Other experts said the 95 percent figure is too low. \n \n Jeff Severinghaus, a geoscientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said that through the use of radioactive isotopes, scientists are more than 99 percent sure that much of the carbon in the air has human fingerprints on it. And because of basic physics, scientists are 99 percent certain that carbon traps heat in what is called the greenhouse effect. \n \n But the role of nature and all sorts of other factors bring the number down to 95 percent when you want to say that the majority of the warming is human-caused, he said. \n \n ___ \n \n Seth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Climate change \"threatens our planet, our only home\", warns Thomas Stocker, IPCC co-chair \n \n A landmark report says scientists are 95% certain that humans are the \"dominant cause\" of global warming since the 1950s. \n \n The report by the UN's climate panel details the physical evidence behind climate change. \n \n On the ground, in the air, in the oceans, global warming is \"unequivocal\", it explained. \n \n It adds that a pause in warming over the past 15 years is too short to reflect long-term trends. \n \n The panel warns that continued emissions of greenhouse gases will cause further warming and changes in all aspects of the climate system. \n \n To contain these changes will require \"substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions\". \n \n Image caption Projections are based on assumptions about how much greenhouse gases might be released \n \n After a week of intense negotiations in the Swedish capital, the summary for policymakers on the physical science of global warming has finally been released. \n \n The first part of an IPCC trilogy, due over the next 12 months, this dense, 36-page document is considered the most comprehensive statement on our understanding of the mechanics of a warming planet. \n \n It states baldly that, since the 1950s, many of the observed changes in the climate system are \"unprecedented over decades to millennia\". \n \n Document IPCC Summary for Policymakers [3MB] Most computers will open PDF documents automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here \n \n Each of the last three decades has been successively warmer at the Earth's surface, and warmer than any period since 1850, and probably warmer than any time in the past 1,400 years. \n \n \"Our assessment of the science finds that the atmosphere and ocean have warmed, the amount of snow and ice has diminished, the global mean sea level has risen and that concentrations of greenhouse gases have increased,\" said Qin Dahe, co-chair of IPCC working group one, who produced the report. \n \n Speaking at a news conference in the Swedish capital, Prof Thomas Stocker, another co-chair, said that climate change \"challenges the two primary resources of humans and ecosystems, land and water. In short, it threatens our planet, our only home\". \n \n Since 1950, the report's authors say, humanity is clearly responsible for more than half of the observed increase in temperatures. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Dr Rajendra Pachauri said he was confident the report would convince the public on global climate change \n \n But a so-called pause in the increase in temperatures in the period since 1998 is downplayed in the report. The scientists point out that this period began with a very hot El Nino year. \n \n \"Trends based on short records are very sensitive to the beginning and end dates and do not in general reflect long-term climate trends,\" the report says. \n \n Prof Stocker, added: \"I'm afraid there is not a lot of public literature that allows us to delve deeper at the required depth of this emerging scientific question. \n \n \"For example, there are not sufficient observations of the uptake of heat, particularly into the deep ocean, that would be one of the possible mechanisms to explain this warming hiatus.\" \n \n \"Likewise we have insufficient data to adequately assess the forcing over the last 10-15 years to establish a relationship between the causes of the warming.\" \n \n However, the report does alter a key figure from the 2007 study. The temperature range given for a doubling of CO2 in the atmosphere, called equilibrium climate sensitivity, was 2.0C to 4.5C in that report. \n \n In the latest document, the range has been changed to 1.5C to 4.5C. The scientists say this reflects improved understanding, better temperature records and new estimates for the factors driving up temperatures. \n \n What is the IPCC? In its own words, the IPCC is there \"to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts\". The offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate. These are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments. The IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis. \n \n In the summary for policymakers, the scientists say the rise in ocean waters will proceed at a faster rate than we have experienced over the past 40 years. Global mean sea level rise for 2081\u22122100, the document says, is projected to be between 26cm (at the low end) and 82cm (at the high end), depending on the greenhouse emissions path this century. \n \n The scientists say ocean warming dominates the increase in energy stored in the climate system, accounting for 90% of energy accumulated between 1971 and 2010. \n \n For the future, the report states that warming is projected to continue under all scenarios. Model simulations indicate that global surface temperature change by the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius, relative to 1850. \n \n Prof Sir Brian Hoskins, from Imperial College London, told BBC News: \"We are performing a very dangerous experiment with our planet, and I don't want my grandchildren to suffer the consequences of that experiment.\" \n \n Follow Matt on Twitter. ||||| STOCKHOLM \u2014 The world\u2019s top climate scientists on Friday formally embraced an upper limit on greenhouse gases for the first time, establishing a target level at which humanity must stop spewing them into the atmosphere or face irreversible climatic changes. They warned that the target is likely to be exceeded in a matter of decades unless steps are taken soon to reduce emissions. \n \n Unveiling the latest United Nations assessment of climate science, the experts cited a litany of changes that were already under way, warned that they were likely to accelerate and expressed virtual certainty that human activity is the main cause. \u201cClimate change is the greatest challenge of our time,\u201d said Thomas F. Stocker, co-chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations-sponsored group of scientists that produced the report. \u201cIn short, it threatens our planet, our only home.\u201d \n \n The panel, in issuing its most definitive assessment yet of the risks of human-caused warming, hoped to give impetus to international negotiations toward a new climate treaty, which have languished in recent years in a swamp of technical and political disputes. The group made clear that time was not on the planet\u2019s side if emissions continued unchecked. \n \n \u201cHuman influence has been detected in warming of the atmosphere and the ocean, in changes in the global water cycle, in reductions in snow and ice, in global mean sea level rise, and in changes in some climate extremes,\u201d the report said. \u201cIt is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.\u201d \n \n The new report is a 36-page summary for world leaders of a 900-page report that is to be released next week on the physical science of climate change. That will be followed by additional reports in 2014 on the most likely impacts and on possible steps to limit the damage. A draft of the summary leaked last month, and the final version did not change greatly, though it was edited for clarity. \n \n Going well beyond its four previous analyses of the emissions problem, the panel endorsed a \u201ccarbon budget\u201d for humanity \u2014 a limit on the amount of the primary greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, that can be produced by industrial activities and the clearing of forests. No more than one trillion metric tons of carbon could be burned and the resulting gases released into the atmosphere, the panel found, if planetary warming is to be kept below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above the level of preindustrial times. That temperature is a target above which scientists believe the most dangerous effects of climate change would begin to occur. \n \n Just over a half-trillion tons have already been burned since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, and at the rate energy consumption is growing, the trillionth ton will be burned sometime around 2040, according to calculations by Myles R. Allen, a scientist at the University of Oxford and one of the authors of the new report. More than three trillion tons of carbon are still left in the ground as fossil fuels. \n \n Once the trillion-ton budget is exhausted, companies that wanted to keep burning fossil fuels would have to come up with ways to capture carbon dioxide and store it underground. In the United States, the Obama administration is moving forward with rules that would essentially require such technology, which is likely to be costly, for any future coal-burning power plants; the president\u2019s Republican opponents have accused him of waging a \u201cwar on coal.\u201d \n \n The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is a worldwide committee of hundreds of scientists that issues major reports every five or six years, advising governments on the latest knowledge on climate change. \n \n The group has now issued five major reports since 1990, each of them finding greater certainty that the world is warming and greater likelihood that human activity is the chief cause. The new report finds a 95 to 100 percent chance that most of the warming of recent decades is human-caused, up from the 90 to 100 percent chance cited in the last report, in 2007. \n \n But the new document also acknowledges that climate science still contains uncertainties, including the likely magnitude of the warming for a given level of emissions, the rate at which the ocean will rise, and the likelihood that plants and animals will be driven to extinction. The scientists emphasized, however, that those uncertainties cut in both directions and the only way to limit the risk is to limit emissions. \n \n Climate-skeptic organizations assailed the new report as alarmist even before it was published. \n \n The Heartland Institute, a Chicago organization, issued a document last week saying that any additional global warming would likely be limited to a few tenths of a degree and that this \u201cwould not represent a climate crisis.\u201d \n \n One issue much cited by the climate doubters is the slowdown in global warming that has occurred over the past 15 years. The report acknowledged that it was not fully understood, but said such pauses had occurred in the past and the natural variability of climate was a likely explanation.",
    "reference": "\u2013 The UN's climate change panel for the first time charted the upper limit of acceptable global carbon emissions today\u2014and we're already halfway to it. Based on an internationally agreed upon goal of keeping temperatures within 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of their pre-industrial levels, humanity can only allow gas from 1 trillion tons of burned carbon to enter the atmosphere, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said in its report, according to the New York Times. We're on pace to hit that ceiling in 2040. The much-anticipated report was released this morning following a furious night of editing, but the substance of it hasn't changed much since a draft was released in August. The report also presents what, according to the BBC, is considered the most comprehensive statement on how climate change works, concluding with 95% certainty that human activity \"has been the dominant cause\" of the warming trend. That, the AP points out, is as certain as scientists are that cigarettes kill you, and more certain than they are that vitamins improve your health."

    "input": "Donating breast milk after her son's death, mother helps another baby survive \n \n Aiding other children can help moms through their grief, some experts say \n \n She remembers going into another room to pump and weeping as the bottle filled, knowing the milk was no longer for her 7-week-old Phil. Instead, it would go to other babies struggling to survive. Peszat continued to pump for another week and donated that milk, as well as a freezer full of 4-ounce bottles she'd been saving for the son who never came home. \n \n After Elizabeth Peszat's newborn took his last breath in the neonatal intensive care unit, her breasts swelled with milk despite her grief. \n \n Elizabeth and Phil Peszat hold a photo of their son, Phil, who died last year when he was 7 weeks old. Elizabeth Peszat donated the breast milk that she continued to pump after his death. (Phil Velasquez, Chicago Tribune) \n \n \"It was still, in a way, comforting that other babies could use the milk even though Phil couldn't have it anymore,\" said 32-year-old Peszat of Hawthorn Woods, tearing up as she recalled the Feb. 5, 2013, death of her firstborn. \n \n Lactation after infant loss has historically been a taboo subject in the halls of many hospitals. Medical professionals for so long had little guidance on how to approach that moment when milk comes in as a mother mourns her stillborn, or the pain in continuing to pump when there's no longer a baby to feed. But hospitals in recent years have been folding more lactation support into counseling for bereaved mothers, helping to ease postpartum mourning and adding to the coffers of milk banks around the country. \n \n Thirty-four bereaved mothers donated milk in this part of the Midwest last year, compared to two in 2006, according to the Indiana Mothers' Milk Bank, which was established in 2005 and covers Illinois and four other states. \n \n Some grieving moms like Peszat say they find comfort in donating their milk, for it extends their ability to mother after their baby is gone. \n \n A few days after baby Phil died, Gladys Garcia Limmo of Des Plaines was rushed to the same hospital and gave birth to twin boys at 23 weeks and four days. Elijah James lived only about six hours, dying after an emergency baptism. \n \n But Levi John, weighing just over a pound, was nourished by breast milk from a feeding tube and grew stronger in the neonatal intensive care unit at Advocate Children's Hospital in Park Ridge. Some of that milk, identified only by numbers on the bottles, came from Peszat. \n \n Levi John turned 1 Saturday. He weighs more than 15 pounds. \n \n Limmo, 38, believes the donor milk helped her baby persevere. \n \n \"I am so thankful for the one who gave the milk,\" she said. \n \n 'A way of bonding' \n \n Peszat and her husband, Phil, met as counselors at a youth camp in Lake Geneva, Wis., and married about five years ago. \n \n \"This was definitely the person I wanted to mother my child,\" Phil Peszat remembers thinking as they dated. \n \n Baby Phil was born Dec. 19, 2012, at 23 weeks and five days' gestation. \n \n At 1 pound, 7 ounces, he had an arm thinner than his mother's pinkie. His hair was a striking shade of strawberry blond. Relatives said he had his mom's chin. \n \n Peszat said her first drops of milk brought her joy. She triumphantly brought a bit of thick colostrum to the hospital, to be fed to baby Phil through a nasal tube. \n \n She remembers the nurses cheered. Breast milk is considered the perfect blend of water and fat and protein and carbohydrates, laced with the antibodies of the mother, in a recipe that mysteriously alters based on the needs of the baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics in 2012 stated unequivocally that all preterm infants should receive only breast milk, either from the mother or pasteurized donor milk. ||||| There are many kinds of women who deserve to be honored on Mother's Day. Many nurture and care for their own children. Some, like Amy Hanson, 30, also helped nourish the children of others. \n \n Preeclampsia had forced Amy to have an emergency C-section on March 15, 2015, delivering Adalyn Rose \"Addie\" Hanson at 27 weeks and 5 days gestation at Rush University Medical Center. The micropreemie weighed not quite a pound-and-a-half and was immediately taken to the neonatal intensive care unit. For the first days of her daughter's short life, Amy was only able to see her via Facetime. \n \n So the Chicago mother started pumping, the rhythm of the machine and flow of breast milk connecting mom and baby when no other connection was possible. Amy, who also works as a pharmacist at Rush, had heard of the difficulties of nursing and wasn't sure pumping alone would work. She was a little surprised when her milk came in without a baby present to suckle. \n \n \"It's still incredible that your body knows and that it happens so soon,\" she said. \n \n Addie was just 12 inches long with dark hair, her chin and toes resembling those of her father, Jeff Hanson. \n \n Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune Nurse Krystle Ekhoff, left, looks over Amy Hanson's baby album at Rush University Medical Center on Feb. 18, 2016. Hanson's baby was born prematurely last March and died in August, but she kept pumping milk and donated it for other premature babies.

(Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) \n \n \"Her diaper was the size of a Splenda packet, so small,\" Amy recalled, smiling at the memory of gingerly changing the newborn when they reunited. \n \n Amy tried to put Addie on her breast when she was about a month old, but she was still too weak and couldn't nurse much. \n \n So the mother kept pumping, in part to pass along her immunity through the milk, hoping it might make up for the third trimester in the womb her daughter had been denied. \n \n Every two to three hours, six to eight times a day, Amy kept filling 4-ounce bottles, too focused on her baby's survival to keep track as the leftovers accumulated in a freezer at Rush. \n \n Addie held on in the NICU for 160 days, a little over five months. \n \n \"She never turned that corner of getting better,\" Amy said. \"The whole big picture was that she just wasn't meeting the milestones that her lungs needed to meet.\" \n \n On Aug. 23, Amy held Addie for the last time, reciting Psalm 23: ... Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me ... \n \n \"I read that to her and she passed away,\" Amy said. \"She passed away probably within the hour.\" \n \n Even after the burial at Sts. Peter and Paul Cemetery in Naperville, Amy continued making milk for a few weeks, until it finally tapered off to a trickle. \n \n So the mother stopped pumping. It was time. \n \n Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune A nurse looks over Amy Hanson's baby album, showing Amy and her husband Jeff Hanson with their baby Adalyn Rose at Rush University Medical Center's NICU in 2015.

(Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) (Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) \n \n In the back of her mind, Amy said she always knew she would donate the extra milk if her daughter couldn't come home, believing it would help another baby. The American Academy of Pediatrics in 2012 advocated that preterm infants receive only breast milk from either the mother or pasteurized donor milk, citing protection against infection as well as long-term health benefits. Preterm milk like Amy's is particularly nutritious for those tiniest of patients in the NICU. \n \n Amy said she was stunned when a lactation consultant revealed just how much she had pumped: First she saw one large crate packed with more than 50 4-ounce bottles. Then she realized there were 21 more crates. She ended up donating 5,000 ounces \u2014 almost 40 gallons of milk \u2014 enough to feed about 22 preemies for a month, according to nurses at Rush. \n \n The hospital held a small ceremony at the NICU in February to commemorate the donation as well as to remember Addie. \n \n The first human milk bank in Illinois, which began pasteurizing in January, has had more than 90 donors so far, said Summer Kelly, executive director of Mothers' Milk Bank of the Western Great Lakes in Elk Grove Village, which serves Illinois and Wisconsin. Nine of them were bereaved mothers, including Amy, whose donation was divided between the new Illinois milk bank and one in Ohio. \n \n Approaching a grieving mother about milk donation can be a delicate task, said Kelly, a former obstetrics nurse and NICU lactation consultant. But she said most women are grateful for the chance to make that choice, even if they decline to donate or decide to suppress their milk. Many say making this most intimate donation helps them heal. \n \n \"They just absolutely can't bear the thought of throwing the milk away,\" she said. \"And they want to help other babies, that's very universal among bereaved mothers.\" \n \n Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune Amy Hanson, a pharmacist at Rush University Medical Center, speaks with Dr. Aloka Patel, during a small event at the hospital, as they prepared to send about 40 gallons of Amy's breast milk to an Ohio's milk bank on Feb. 18, 2016.

But Amy said her fear was eclipsed by the joy of the prospect of motherhood, another chance to hold and feed and care for a child. \n \n \"I loved being a mom,\" she said, tearing up. \n \n The Hansons are expecting another baby girl, due July 23. The pregnancy has been healthy with no troubling symptoms. \n \n They plan to tell her all about her big sister Adalyn Rose, whose milk helped feed so many other babies fighting for survival. \n \n eleventis@tribpub.com \n \n Twitter @angie_leventis ||||| \u201cI decided to donate Bryson\u2019s milk and turn my tragedy into a blessing,\u201d states Amy Anderson, from Caribou, Maine. \n \n In the fall of 2010, Anderson lost her son Bryson at 20 weeks gestation. Trusting her intuition, she disregarded her physician\u2019s advice to \u201cbind your breasts and take Sudafed.\u201d Instead, she began to pump the breast milk that would have nourished Bryson. \n \n \u201cAt the time, I didn\u2019t know what I would do with the milk, but I knew I needed to stop trying to prevent my body from lactating,\u201d remembers Anderson. \n \n She began to research and quickly discovered there was a great need for donor breast milk, especially with regard to the best practices of care employed to save the lives of prematurely born babies. \n \n As we celebrate the holiday season, and in honor of the newly opened breast milk bank at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), the following interview with Anderson provides important reflections on gratitude and grief. \n \n Furthermore, Anderson\u2019s experience of being discriminated against at work when seeking to have breastfeeding laws apply to her situation necessitates the need for legislative change. Certainly, lactating surrogates and bereaved mothers who pump breast milk deserve not only respect but also legal protection. \n \n Amy, tell me about yourself. \n \n I live in Caribou, Maine -- up north by the Canadian border. I married my high-school sweetheart. We have two living children (ages 8 and 2-and-a-half) and four \u201cangel babies\u201d in between them. Currently, I am a work-at-home mom. I also volunteer online for Mothers\u2019 Milk Bank Northeast (MMBNE) while working toward completing my certification as a breastfeeding consultant. \n \n \"I pumped for 8 months to the day. Just imagine how many lives his nearly 92 gallons of milk saved!\" -- Amy Anderson \n \n \n \n Tell me about your son Bryson. \n \n We lost our third child, whom we named Bryson, in 2010. We discovered at 15 weeks gestation that our son had a lower urinary tract obstruction (LUTO). Tragically, the morning before our appointment to finally schedule his surgery, Bryson died in utero. His heart couldn\u2019t handle the pressure that was building up in his bladder. I delivered his body at the age of 20 weeks. \n \n I am so sorry to hear about your loss. Your son died right before the fall and winter holiday season, right? \n \n Yes. Bryson\u2019s body was delivered on Oct. 30, and the holidays that year were simply unbearable. My grief was heavy, and while I found comfort in expressing milk in his name, no one in my family dared to talk about my baby. However, that is actually what I needed the most. \n \n A mother\u2019s love is a mother\u2019s love regardless of whether or not her child lives or dies. \n \n What inspired you to begin pumping breast milk following Bryson\u2019s death? \n \n No one prepared me for what would happen to my breasts after Bryson was born. In fact, I was told that it was way too early for breast milk to be produced by my body. But this was a horrible misconception. Within a couple days after delivering Bryson, my milk came in. My rock-hard chest was throbbing, and milk saturated everything. No one suggested the option of donating Bryson\u2019s milk. \n \n I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to pump, as breastfeeding is based on a supply-and-demand relationship. But I was in horrid pain, so I decided to pump \u201cjust a little\u201d to relieve my body. Six ounces of colostrum milk were expressed during a couple minutes of that first pumping session. I felt such relief. \n \n As I expressed the milk, a real sense of calm descended. I felt a powerful closeness to my Bryson, which reminded me how much I loved the breastfeeding relationship I had shared with my eldest son. Pumping milk in Bryson\u2019s memory felt so very right. All life has meaning, and my son\u2019s life was no different. I decided to embrace his life\u2019s purpose. \n \n Tell me more about \u201chis life\u2019s purpose.\u201d \n \n At first, I couldn\u2019t understand why Bryson was taken. I would hear of parents who didn\u2019t want their children, who would beat them, and nothing made sense. Yet, through pumping and donating his milk, I came to see that Bryson\u2019s death held a blessing in disguise. \n \n Because Bryson was so early, my milk was deemed \u201cpreterm breast milk\u201d and was very nutrient-rich. In fact, it was considerably healthier than full-term breast milk, as my body made it to sustain the life of a significantly premature baby. It is normal practice for the milk bank to combine the milk of three or more donors, but they kept Bryson\u2019s milk separate and gave it to the highest of high-needs babies. It really was off the charts how phenomenal his milk was. I pumped for eight months to the day. Just imagine how many lives his nearly 92 gallons of milk saved! \n \n How do you hold space for both your grief and gratitude? \n \n The grief of losing my son is a reflection of the love I have for him. I couldn\u2019t give my love or milk to Bryson, as he wasn\u2019t there in the physical sense. Yet I was able to express my love for him through expressing and donating his milk. It was very healing both physically and emotionally. \n \n While there are definitely still tears, my heart fills with mother\u2019s pride as I share his story. Through my grief, I have found gratitude, and my sense of gratitude continues to multiply. I\u2019ve learned to always look for the blessing in a situation, though it quite possibly is disguised. Honestly, I could, and will, talk about his legacy forever. \n \n What specific benefits do premature babies receive through donor breast milk? \n \n I wanted to do everything I could by donating Bryson\u2019s milk to help families avoid the heartbreak of baby loss. As I researched, I learned about necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), which is an excruciatingly painful bowel disease that causes parts of the intestines to die. NEC is the second-leading cause of death for premature babies. \n \n According to the NEC Society, the use of a human milk diet [mother's own milk or donor milk] can lower the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis by 79 percent. As Diane L. Spatz [Ph.D., RN-BC] writes: \u201cIn the NICU, human milk must be viewed as a medical intervention that is just as important as IV nutrition or a ventilator.\u201d \n \n Premature babies suffer when given formula, which is incredibly unhealthy for their immature digestive system. Human breast milk is by far the better option. It absolutely saves lives. In this sense, donating breast milk isn\u2019t so different from organ donation. Bereaved lactating women can offer irreplaceable life-saving nutrients in honor of their precious angel babies. \n \n You pumped for eight months and worked outside of the home during this time. As a lactating bereaved mother, how were you treated? \n \n My former employer insisted that rights protected under the Break Time for Nursing Mothers law didn\u2019t pertain to my situation. \n \n \u201cYour baby is dead,\u201d the administrators told me. \n \n These words stung like a second grief. Whether or not I had a baby, I was a lactating woman with physical needs. \n \n The terminology in our federal law relating to the rights of breastfeeding mothers at work is a real problem. Federal law stipulates that breaks to express milk only apply to \u201cnursing mothers\u201d who pump \u201cfor her nursing child.\u201d While I wasn\u2019t expressing milk for a living, nursing child of my own, I was expressing milk for many high-risk infants who may otherwise die without a supply of healthy donor milk. \n \n While I have completely moved forward from this workplace experience, I am dedicated to changing the terminology of the federal law to be formally inclusive of all lactating women. Currently, bereaved and surrogate mothers who chose to express breast milk can be excluded from the protection of the federal mandate due to the terminology used. However, all lactating women deserve the same rights. \n \n In addition to contacting our legislators about this topic, what more can be done to support bereaved mothers? \n \n I am trying to encourage professionals involved in caring for pregnant women to discuss lactation following birth -- including lactation after loss. I realize that donating through grief is not right for everyone. But for bereaved women to make an informed choice about the matter, they first need to know that pumping and donating their baby\u2019s milk is an option. \n \n Amy, I\u2019ve so enjoyed speaking with you, and I thank you for your time. Do you have any final thoughts to share before we conclude? \n \n As Bryson\u2019s mother, it is such an honor to have this opportunity to bring support and advocacy to mothers faced with lactation following the devastation of baby loss. Equally as important is the education of individuals about the benefits of this unique form of organ donation that can be completely life-changing for the many precious recipients of donor milk. \n \n To learn more about Amy Anderson\u2019s work, visit her Facebook page \u201cDonating through Grief.\u201d \n \n \n \n The Anderson family.

That's because your body will automatically produce milk that's specially designed to nourish your premature baby, with extra calories, vitamins, and protein. What's more, the live cells in breast milk that protect babies from infection can be even more important for premature babies: Preemies face a higher risk of infection because their immune systems are particularly immature. You will find artificial formulas and supplements made just for preemies, but they can't provide the antibodies and other protective factors that are in your breast milk and are so beneficial to a fragile premature infant. \n \n Whether or not your baby is ready to nurse at your breast right away will depend on his gestational age and overall health. At many hospitals it's standard practice to start off feeding very premature babies expressed breast milk through a nasogastric (NG) tube (known as gavage). This is to make sure the baby gets as much nourishment as possible if he's too immature to suckle from breast or bottle. \n \n You'll work closely with the hospital staff overseeing your baby's care on a plan to feed your pumped breast milk to your baby. Many preemies simply aren't ready to start breastfeeding in the hospital right away, and won't be released until they've started to gain weight from breast- and/or bottle-feeding. \n \n Once your baby is able to start nursing at the breast, be prepared to nurse frequently, although preemies may not take in much milk at each feeding until they're closer to term. For this reason, you'll need to pump after feedings to keep up your milk production as well as have milk for any necessary supplementary feedings. You may need to use different breastfeeding holds for your preemie. Hospital staff, including lactation professionals, may be helpful when you start breastfeeding. \n \n What challenges could I face? \n \n If your baby is too immature to breastfeed right after birth, your initial challenge will be to stimulate and maintain your milk supply. The most efficient and convenient way to do this is to use a hospital-grade pump with a double collection kit (a hospital nurse or lactation consultant will get one for you and show you how to use it). You'll also eventually want to rent one to use for the first several weeks at home, until you're sure your baby is feeding well at your breast. \n \n Once your baby is ready to move on to the breast, learning how to latch on and suck can be difficult. Most babies don't develop the suck-swallow-breathe reflex that's critical for feeding until about week 32 in the womb, eight weeks before they're considered full-term. It can also be challenging to figure out whether your baby is getting enough by breast alone if you're used to supplementing feedings. \n \n A common rule in taking care of preterm babies is to limit how much they cry, on the theory that crying wastes precious energy better devoted to growing. Of course, it's harder to care for a baby when you can't wait for him to cry out to say he's hungry or uncomfortable. You'll have to learn to anticipate your baby's hunger, which takes time. \n \n How can I solve these problems? \n \n You can start by tuning in to your baby's cues. To minimize crying and maximize intake, you must figure out when your baby wants to eat, and when he'll be ready for the next feeding. This isn't easy because premature babies tend to be quieter when asking for food than their full-term peers. Wakefulness may be the only clue that he's getting hungry, instead of the full-throated wail heard in most nurseries. \n \n You'll also want to continue to pump after you nurse to make sure you're keeping up your supply. You may want to hire a lactation consultant to help you check your baby's weight gain, or consider renting an electronic scale so you can weigh your baby before and after nursing sessions to see how much he's taking in. \n \n Aim for feeding your baby at least every three hours or so, about eight feedings every 24 hours. This schedule is flexible, and if he seems hungry only two hours after eating, by all means let him try again. It's also okay to wake him up to nurse. In fact, disturbing a nap may actually trigger the suckling instinct. \n \n The life of a preterm baby is little more than eating and sleeping, and when your baby's not eating, you need to think about how to get him to eat. This may mean, for example, unwrapping him, or even taking off his clothes to stimulate his need for comfort, and for suckling. \n \n Where can I get more help? \n \n La Leche League International (LLLI) is a great place to direct all your breastfeeding-related questions, and they'll probably be able to introduce you to other moms who are nursing premature children. You may want to hire a lactation consultant to help you through the early weeks. Doctors and nurses will certainly be able to answer a lot of your questions, but you may need more hands-on help. LLLI also has books and other resources for moms of preterm babies.",

It was a \u201cmilestone for all people and our planet,\u201d said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, who highlighted the positive impacts of the Montreal Protocol on human health, poverty eradication, climate change, and protecting the food chain at an anniversary celebration. \n \n The Earth\u2019s ozone layer would have collapsed by 2050 with catastrophic consequences without the Montreal Protocol, studies have shown. In the world we avoided thanks to the Protocol the UV Index measure during a Washington, DC or Los Angles mid-summer day would be at least 30 by 2070. Anything over 11 is considered extreme. There would have been an additional 280 million cases of skin cancer, 1.5 million skin cancer deaths, and 45 million cataracts in the United States, according to the U.S. EPA. \n \n Further, climate change would have been far worse by mid-century because the chemicals that \u201ceat\u201d ozone are also super-greenhouse gases, thousands of times more potent than CO2. And that would have meant the potential intensity of hurricanes and cyclones would have increased three times, another study found. \n \n The combined impacts of UV levels that could literally burn skin in five minutes and hotter, stormier weather is something no one would want to live in or wish for their grandchildren, said Rolando Garcia, a senior scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. \n \n Our global climate would be at least 25 per cent hotter today without the Protocol, said Garcia, a co-author of two world-avoided studies. That additional heat energy would have provided \u201cfuel\u201c for today\u2019s extreme weather events like hurricanes, floods, and droughts. By 2070 the world would have been 4.5 degrees F (2.5 degrees Celsius) hotter, a level most experts agree is disastrously high. \n \n \u201cIn 1987 I don\u2019t think anyone knew about the full climate implications,\u201d said Garcia. \u201cThe Protocol saved our bacon a little bit.\u201d \n \n Ozone Politics \n \n The ozone layer acts like a shield reducing the amount of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation to safer levels. By the late 1970s scientists proved chemicals used in fridges, air conditioners, and aerosol cans were damaging this ozone shield. But the chemical industry argued the science was uncertain, and more research was needed. Then, in 1985, a gigantic hole appeared in the ozone layer over Antarctica, allowing dangerous levels of UV radiation to reach the surface. By 1987 the Montreal Protocol was created to reduce the amounts of those chemicals. \n \n Industry lobbied the Ronald Reagan White House and tried to get the Senate to deny ratification of the Protocol, warning of dire economic impacts resulting from a phase-down of their products. \n \n \u201cIt was just as bad as the fossil fuel industry has been on climate change,\u201d said David Doniger, Director, Climate and Clean Air Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council. \n \n View Images People bathe in the sea in southern France\u2014but without a protective ozone layer, such activities would be much more dangerous. Photograph by BERTRAND LANGLOIS, AFP, Getty Images \n \n And yet the U.S. was one of the first countries to ratify the Protocol and have been a leader on the revisions that sped up the phase-outs of ozone-destroying chemicals, Doniger said. Industry soon developed new products and got on board with the phase-out of the old chemicals. \n \n The Protocol now has 197 countries participating and resulted in the phase-out of 99 percent of nearly 100 ozone-depleting chemicals. It\u2019s often considered the most successful international environmental treaty in history. \n \n \"Thirty years ago the world proved it can come together and tackle a global problem with global resolve,\u201d said Erik Solheim, head of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). \n \n \u201cThe Montreal Protocol is as necessary today as it was in the 1980s,\u201d Solheim said. \n \n Unfinished Business \n \n The ozone layer is expected to recover by 2050 but the Protocol has two major pieces of unfinished business. Some countries in the developing world haven\u2019t yet phased out ozone-damaging chemicals like R-22, a hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) found in many refrigeration and air conditioning systems. They\u2019ll require financial support to do so, which the Protocol provides under its Multilateral Fund. \n \n The Multilateral Fund will need to be replenished for the next three years at the upcoming Montreal Protocol conference in November. The U.S. usually provides about 20 percent of the funding, but \u201cthe Trump Administration has been completely silent on this so far,\u201d said Doniger. \n \n This funding is crucial to help poor countries not only eliminate the last ozone-damaging chemicals but also to leapfrog cheap replacement chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). While HFCs are safe for ozone, they are a powerful greenhouse gas, a thousand times worse than CO2. In 2016, after nearly ten years of negotiations, more than 150 countries agreed to reduce their use by 85 percent in the coming decades. \n \n The use of HFCs for air conditioning and refrigeration is growing at a fast pace in developing countries, particularly China and India, Doniger said. That\u2019s in part because climate change is producing more and longer deadly heat waves and driving up summer temperatures. \n \n This HFC phase down is known as the Kigali Amendment to the Protocol and would have a big impact on climate change, cutting global warming up to 0.9 degrees F (0.5 degrees Celsius) by the end of the century, according to the UNEP. \n \n That\u2019s a big deal because even limiting global warming to under 3.6 degrees F (2 degrees Celsius) will still cut Africa\u2019s agricultural yields by 40 percent, putting 50 percent of the continent\u2019s population at risk of undernourishment. ||||| Illegal production of CFC-11 in China has a climate impact equivalent to 16-20 coal power plants, the Environmental Investigation Agency estimates \n \n By Megan Darby \n \n Chinese factories are illegally producing chemicals that damage the ozone layer and the climate. \n \n That was revealed in a survey of manufacturers carried out by the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) and corroborated by the New York Times on Monday. \n \n The EIA identified eight companies in four provinces that were using CFC-11 in the production of plastic foams, which are most commonly used for building insulation. It is one of a group of chemicals banned under the 1987 Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer. \n \n \u201cThese and other well placed sources in the Chinese chemical industry strongly suggest that this is a wider practice,\u201d said the agency\u2019s Avipsa Mahapatra. \n \n The green watchdog estimates up to 70% of Chinese rigid foam production uses CFC-11, which has a global warming effect as well as depleting ozone. By the EIA\u2019s calculation, this illegal activity has a climate impact equivalent to 16-20 coal power stations. \n \n Its findings go a long way to explain mysteriously high levels of the pollutant detected by air monitors, in data published in Nature last month. \n \n If you like what we do, support us Become a CHN patron for as little as $5 per month to help us keep bringing you the most in-depth coverage of climate politics and underreported stories from around the world.

Evidence of other illegal production hotspots has been passed to the Chinese authorities. \n \n Climate Home News previously reported that the Montreal Protocol\u2019s scientific assessment panel is due to examine rogue emissions and report to national representatives by the end of the year. \n \n Production of chlorofluorocarbons, which were also used as coolants, was fully banned in developed countries from 1996. The developing world was given until 2010 to phase out usage, with financial support to switch to substitutes. \n \n In the 1990s and early 2000s, a certain amount of black market activity was exposed, but the discovery of widespread illegal activity so long after the deadline shocked experts. \n \n \u201cIt is outrageous that industrial climate-killers banned several years ago continue to be produced, used and emitted at this scale in an industry where better technology is easily available. This could undermine not just the slowly healing ozone but also the global efforts to battle climate change,\u201d said Mahapatra. \n \n Approved substitutes for CFC-11 also have a global warming effect, but it is much less strong. The intermediate option, HCFC-141b, has around a sixth the global warming potential, and cleaner options are available. \n \n In 2016, countries agreed to amend the Montreal Protocol to tackle the climate impact of HFCs, which have replaced CFCs in many applications. Phasing them out could prevent up to 0.5C of warming this century, scientists estimate. \n \n The latest expos\u00e9 shows why the deal needs to have teeth, said Mahapatra. \u201cEIA has been calling for tougher measures to deal with illegal production and trade.

    "reference": "\u2013 Across the world, someone has been illegally producing an ozone-destroying gas banned more than 30 years ago. Now, investigators and the New York Times may have pinpointed the culprit behind the CFC-11 chlorofluorocarbon: factories making foam insulation in remote parts of China. Putting CFC-11 in the insulation, which is used in buildings and refrigerators, isn't as costly as legal alternatives, and some factory owners were surprisingly frank with the Times about their usage. \"Of course, we chose the cheaper foam agent,\" one factory owner, whose plant has since been shut down, says. \"That's how we survived.\" The Environmental Investigation Agency, an independent watchdog, says it found at least eight factories in China using CFC-11 to make foam. The EIA estimates up to 70% of foam production there uses the chemical, per Climate Home News. An expert tells the Times that factories using CFC-11, a violation of 1987's Montreal Protocol, are often smaller operations (some don't even have names) that move around rural outposts to avoid detection; if they do get caught, they simply shrug and pay any fines, if they're not shut down. A study published in Nature in May stressed the issues that this unexpected jump in CFC-11 emissions could pose, namely pushing back the full recovery of the ozone layer by at least 10 years (the target date was originally for the middle of this century). The head of the UN's Environment Program tells the Times that the renewed CFC-11 production is \"an environment crime\" that requires immediate action. \"We have to dig deeper,\" Erik Solheim says in a statement. \"Based on the scale of detected emissions, there is good reason to believe the problem extends beyond these uncovered cases.\" (In other news, researchers see a controversial way to help the planet.)"

    "input": "It took only 60,000 years to kill more than 90 percent of all life on Earth, according to the most precise study yet of the Permian mass extinction, the greatest die-off in the past 540 million years. \n \n The new timeline doesn't reveal the culprit behind the die-off, though scientists have several suspects, such as volcanic eruptions in Siberia that belched massive quantities of climate-changing gases. But pinning down the duration of the Permian mass extinction will help researchers refine its potential trigger mechanisms, said Seth Burgess, lead study author and a geochemist at MIT. \n \n \"Whatever caused the extinction was really rapid, or the biosphere reached some critical threshold,\" Burgess told Live Science. \"Having an accurate timeline for the events surrounding the mass extinction and the interval itself is extremely important, because it gives us an idea of how the biosphere responds.\" \n \n The findings were published today (Feb. 10) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. \n \n Radioactivity and extinctions \n \n The Permian mass extinction marks the end of the Permian geologic period, which ended approximately 252 million years ago. More than 96 percent of marine life and 70 percent of land species perished. By comparison, 85 percent of life died off during the dinosaur-killing extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period, 66 million years ago. [Wipe Out: History's Most Mysterious Extinctions] \n \n \"This is one of the fundamental inflection points in the trajectory of life on Earth,\" Burgess said. \"It set the stage for the [rest] of evolution.\" \n \n The best record of the Permian \"great dying\" is in Meishan, China. In past decades, hundreds of geologists collected and analyzed rocks in Meishan that date from before, during and after the Permian extinction. Researchers analyzed these rocks to better understand what caused the Permian event. Volcanic ash beds interlaced with Meishan marine rocks have tiny minerals called zircons that can be precisely dated with geochemical techniques, and the marine rocks carry scores of fossils that record the die-off and resurgence of life. \n \n Burgess and his co-authors improved the Meishan rock ages with the latest high-resolution, uranium-lead zircon dating techniques. Zircon traps minute amounts of naturally occurring radioactive uranium inside its crystal structure. Uranium decays into lead, and counting the ratio of the two elements provides an age estimate for the zircons. \n \n The new dates show that the mass extinction started 251.941 million years ago (plus or minus 37,000 years) and ended at 251.880 million years ago (plus or minus 31,000 thousand years). The extinction's end also marks the start of the Triassic period, and coincides with the first fossil appearance at Meishan of a toothy, eel-like creature called Hindeodus parvus (a conodont, the source of the earliest teeth found in the fossil record). \n \n Finding the killer(s) \n \n The new timeline also provides greater accuracy for the environmental blows linked with the mass dying. For example, previous work has found an increase in carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, before the mass extinction began. In the Permian rocks, atmospheric carbon dioxide shifts are recorded as changes in the ratio of carbon isotopes. \n \n The new study suggests the increase in carbon dioxide was sudden and short-lived, Burgess said. \"It precedes the extinction by 20,000 years or so, and lasts 10,000 or 15,000 years. It was very short-duration event,\" he said. \n \n But there are other potential tipping points for extinction beyond atmospheric greenhouse gases. For example, sea surface temperatures also rose about 18 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius) over a period beginning before the extinction and continuing into the early Triassic. And the sudden carbon dioxide increase may have made the oceans more acidic. (A similar effect is happening in the present age due to carbon dioxide concentrations that have been rising because of man-made sources since the 1850s.) [Top 10 Ways to Destroy Earth] \n \n \"An accurate and high-precision age model gives us a reliable sounding [board] against which we can start comparing all of the other things that started happening with the mass extinction,\" Burgess said. \n \n The research team is now applying the same age-dating technique to one of the main Permian mass extinction suspects, volcanic rocks from the Siberian Traps, one of the largest volcanic outpourings on Earth. \n \n Email Becky Oskin or follow her @beckyoskin.

They disappeared in the world\u2019s most devastating mass extinction to date. Credit: \u00a9 John Sibbick / Natural History Museum The largest mass extinction in the history of animal life occurred some 252 million years ago, wiping out more than 96 percent of marine species and 70 percent of life on land\u2014including the largest insects known to have inhabited the Earth. Multiple theories have aimed to explain the cause of what's now known as the end-Permian extinction, including an asteroid impact, massive volcanic eruptions, or a cataclysmic cascade of environmental events. But pinpointing the cause of the extinction requires better measurements of how long the extinction period lasted. \n \n Now researchers at MIT have determined that the end-Permian extinction occurred over 60,000 years, give or take 48,000 years\u2014practically instantaneous, from a geologic perspective. The new timescale is based on more precise dating techniques, and indicates that the most severe extinction in history may have happened more than 10 times faster than scientists had previously thought. \n \n \"We've got the extinction nailed in absolute time and duration,\" says Sam Bowring, the Robert R. Shrock Professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences at MIT. \"How do you kill 96 percent of everything that lived in the oceans in tens of thousands of years? It could be that an exceptional extinction requires an exceptional explanation.\" \n \n In addition to establishing the extinction's duration, Bowring, graduate student Seth Burgess, and a colleague from the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology also found that, 10,000 years before the die-off, the oceans experienced a pulse of light carbon, which likely reflects a massive addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. This dramatic change may have led to widespread ocean acidification and increased sea temperatures by 10 degrees Celsius or more, killing the majority of sea life. \n \n But what originally triggered the spike in carbon dioxide? The leading theory among geologists and paleontologists has to do with widespread, long-lasting volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps, a region of Russia whose steplike hills are a result of repeated eruptions of magma. To determine whether eruptions from the Siberian Traps triggered a massive increase in oceanic carbon dioxide, Burgess and Bowring are using similar dating techniques to establish a timescale for the Permian period's volcanic eruptions that are estimated to have covered over five million cubic kilometers. \n \n \"It is clear that whatever triggered extinction must have acted very quickly,\" says Burgess, the lead author of a paper that reports the results in this week's Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, \"fast enough to destabilize the biosphere before the majority of plant and animal life had time to adapt in an effort to survive.\" \n \n Pinning dates on an extinction \n \n In 2006, Bowring and his students made a trip to Meishan, China, a region whose rock formations bear evidence of the end-Permian extinction; geochronologists and paleontologists have flocked to the area to look for clues in its layers of sedimentary rock. In particular, scientists have focused on a section of rock that is thought to delineate the end of the Permian, and the beginning of the Triassic, based on evidence such as the number of fossils found in surrounding rock layers. \n \n Bowring sampled rocks from this area, as well as from nearby alternating layers of volcanic ash beds and fossil-bearing rocks. After analyzing the rocks in the lab, his team reported in 2011 that the end-Permian likely lasted less than 200,000 years. However, this timeframe still wasn't precise enough to draw any conclusions about what caused the extinction. \n \n Now, the team has revised its estimates using more accurate dating techniques based on a better understanding of uncertainties in timescale measurements. \n \n With this knowledge, Bowring and his colleagues reanalyzed rock samples collected from five volcanic ash beds at the Permian-Triassic boundary. The researchers pulverized rocks and separated out tiny zircon crystals containing a mix of uranium and lead. They then isolated uranium from lead, and measured the ratios of both isotopes to determine the age of each rock sample. \n \n From their measurements, the researchers determined a much more precise \"age model\" for the end-Permian extinction, which now appears to have lasted about 60,000 years\u2014with an uncertainty of 48,000 years\u2014and was immediately preceded by a sharp increase in carbon dioxide in the oceans. \n \n 'Spiraling toward the truth' \n \n The new timeline adds weight to the theory that the extinction was triggered by massive volcanic eruptions from the Siberian Traps that released volatile chemicals, including carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere and oceans. With such a short extinction timeline, Bowring says it is possible that a single, catastrophic pulse of magmatic activity triggered an almost instantaneous collapse of all global ecosystems. \n \n To confirm whether the Siberian Traps are indeed the extinction's smoking gun, Burgess and Bowring plan to determine an equally precise timeline for the Siberian Traps eruptions, and will compare it to the new extinction timeline to see where the two events overlap. The researchers will investigate additional areas in China to see if the duration of the extinction can be even more precisely determined. \n \n \"We've refined our approach, and now we have higher accuracy and precision,\" Bowring says. \"You can think of it as slowly spiraling in toward the truth.\" \n \n Explore further: Timeline of a mass extinction: New evidence points to rapid collapse of Earth\u2019s species 252 million years ago \n \n More information: \"High-precision timeline for Earth's most severe extinction,\" by Seth D.

It is, rather, a collection of little ones, with Pee-wee having a chance encounter with a kindred spirit, played by Joe Manganiello, getting invited to a party and impulsively leaving his little town of Fairville for New York, despite his assertion in the early going, \u201cI don\u2019t want to go anywhere or try anything new.\u201d \n \n The subsequent road trip includes, but isn\u2019t limited to, thieves, a stopover in Amish country, and what amounts to an extended farmer\u2019s daughter joke. And, this being a Pee-wee adventure, there\u2019s no shortage of word play, puns and loud, piercing screams. \n \n More Reviews Film Review: 'November Criminals' Film Review: 'Gangster Land' \n \n The producers have asked that reviewers not disclose certain plot points, which is odd, since the cited \u201cspoilers\u201d are almost wholly irrelevant. (They have also asked that the project be included in feature film coverage as opposed to television, which seems like a virtually meaningless distinction, given the likely consumption of this product, and the distribution pattern \u2013 streaming day and date online with its theatrical bow.) \n \n The biggest surprise, frankly, might be that the funniest person here is frequently Manganiello. Indeed, the mere visual juxtaposition of the towering \u201cMagic Mike\u201d star and Reubens in the same frame together is practically a special effect in itself. \n \n That said, unlike in \u201cThe Muppets\u201d \u2013 which might be the franchise\u2019s closest cousin spiritually speaking \u2013 there aren\u2019t really a lot of celebrity cameos. Instead, first-time director John Lee (a veteran of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cInside Amy Schumer\u201d and \u201cBroad City\u201d) simply bounces from episode to episode, until Pee-wee finally reaches his destination, and the movie, both sweetly and somewhat mercifully, runs out of time. \n \n To his credit, Reubens remains as deft at bringing his man-sized child to life as he ever was, a staggering 35 years after inventing him. But it\u2019s perhaps no accident that one of Pee-wee\u2019s most treasured incarnations \u2013 beyond the 1985 movie \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure,\u201d directed by Tim Burton \u2013 might be the more concentrated Saturday-morning TV show that adults and college kids greedily consumed, while their children and younger siblings identified the title character as one of them. \n \n Pee-wee\u2019s grasp of childhood has always been central to his charm. What\u2019s more elusive is discerning a rhyme or reason to Netflix\u2019s nascent movie strategy, which is obviously derived in part from the service\u2019s closely held metrics \u2013 in this context, basically making new versions of stuff people already like to watch, like Adam Sandler movies \u2013 although how precisely the numbers add up on a project such as this is anybody\u2019s guess. \n \n \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday\u201d is a harmless but not especially vital or necessary addition to that portfolio.

(Let's just pretend \"Big Top Pee-wee\" never existed, OK?) \n \n This time, Pee-wee is settled in the quaint 1950s-ish town that he's lived in his whole life. But then actor Joe Manganiello shows up \u2014 his name in the movie is Joe Manganiello \u2014 on his motorcycle and completely wows Pee-wee with his cool style. This motivates Pee-wee to do something he's never done in his life: leave town and take a holiday. \n \n Joe Manganiello is the movie's secret weapon. Netflix \n \n That's right, in this Pee-wee universe, he never went to the Alamo to find his bike, like he did in \"Big Adventure.\" \n \n But as with \"Big Adventure,\" Pee-wee embarks on a hilarious road trip that leads to strange encounters. Just a couple \u2014 that won't spoil anything as they are featured in the trailer \u2014 involve three female bank robbers who are dressed like they came straight out of \"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" and a team of unique hairstylists. \n \n There's a lot of fun in the silly gadgets featured throughout, from how Pee-wee wakes up every morning to the items of a traveling salesman Pee-wee gets a ride from. \n \n In many ways, Reubens, who cowrote the screenplay with \"Love\" creator and star Paul Rust, uses the structure of \"Big Adventure\" to tell the story. There's a silly opening dream sequence, the road-trip storyline, and the goal of the trip, which is wackier this time around than finding his bike. \n \n And then there's just Reubens' strange brand of humor that works as well today as it did in the '80s. I defy you not to laugh out loud during the balloon bit. \n \n Yet the secret weapon of the movie, its modern touch, is Manganiello. He is extremely funny and has a chemistry with Reubens that you'd never think would work until you see it on the screen for yourself. \n \n \"Pee-wee's Big Holiday\" is available to stream on Netflix starting on Friday. ||||| You can put a date on Pee-wee Herman\u2019s peak popularity, but you can\u2019t tie him to a particular time period. Inspired by the kiddie-TV hosts of the 1950s, Paul Reubens created Pee-wee in the \u201980s, and gave the character a fascination with junk-store kitsch from practically every era of American pop culture. (Who else was showing their Batman Credit Card to David Letterman in 1984?) But there\u2019s always been an edge of the new, now, and avant garde to the character as well, whether it\u2019s trusting the design of his TV digs to Jimbo cartoonist Gary Panter or inviting Grace Jones to his Christmas party. So if Pee-wee Herman is to make a cinematic comeback in the 21st century, he might as well do it on Netflix, which puts Pee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday\u2014the first movie starring the character since 1988\u2019s Big Top Pee-wee\u2014on a cutting edge that people also use to watch Friends reruns. \n \n \n \n But that distribution model also means that typing \u201cPee-wee\u201d into the search bar brings up a Big Adventure and a Playhouse right alongside Big Holiday. The new film\u2014directed by Wonder Showzen\u2019s John Lee, produced by Judd Apatow, and co-written by Reubens with Love\u2019s Paul Rust\u2014doesn\u2019t shy from comparisons to Pee-wee\u2019s first, Tim Burton-helmed big-screen outing. The parallels are right there in the title, but the films also follow roughly the same structure, a hero\u2019s journey that breaks Pee-wee out of his idiosyncratic small-town routine and sends him on an epic road trip. Pee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday is a comeback vehicle, but it\u2019s also an attempt to reprise one of the funniest movies ever made. To a large degree, it succeeds. \n \n Big Holiday returns Pee-wee to the highways and byways for a shaggier, less rigorously paced adventure, finding frequent and long-lasting laughs along the way. At 63, Reubens\u2019 physical and vocal range isn\u2019t what it once was, but he still gives Pee-wee (and Big Holiday) an undeniable energy. Dulled though his tics and twitches might be, Reuben\u2019s face still sparks to life in close-up, like a child discovering all the many ways to twist and contort the human features. It\u2019s clear that Pee-wee and his weird, wonderful world continue to amuse and excite Reubens, and his Big Holiday collaborators share the sentiment. Lee\u2019s direction doesn\u2019t have the unmistakable personal stamp of a Burton, though that just gives more authorial control to the main character. Pee-wee\u2019s Big Holiday is the Pee-wee movie that really makes its possessive apostrophe count. \n \n When the film opens, Pee-wee has no interest in traveling beyond the borders of Fairville, a backlot burg that looks like a time capsule and runs like clockwork. (Everything\u2019s so predictable in Fairville, the local diner even has color-coded hairnets that correspond to the days of the week.) While he\u2019s slinging hash at that diner, Pee-wee strikes up a bond with a mysterious stranger (Joe Manganiello in the role he was born to play: \u201cJoe Manganiello\u201d), who encourages his new friend to \u201clive a little,\u201d and eventually hands him his ticket out of town: an invitation to Manganiello\u2019s birthday party, all the way across the country in New York City. Between Fairville and the Big Apple, there are reptiles (and reptile puns), farmer\u2019s daughters itching to get hitched, an Amish idyll, and a trio of bank robbers (Alia Shawkat, Stephanie Beatriz, and Jessica Pohly) that represent the closest thing Big Holiday has to antagonists. \n \n If there\u2019s anything tying together the detours and roadblocks that comprise Big Holiday, it\u2019s the film\u2019s big, bold, screaming celebration of human difference. Pee-wee sticks out from his square Fairville surroundings in the same way the character has always stuck out from the entertainment mainstream, and the characters he encounters on the road live similarly outsider existences, like a traveling salesman (Patrick Egan), a quartet of traveling hair stylists (Darryl Stephens, Dionne Gipson, Anthony Alabi, and Sonya Eddy), or an eccentric heiress (Diane Salinger, providing Big Holiday\u2019s most poignant link to Big Adventure). The concept is made explicit in his first encounter with the bank robbers, but it runs beneath the surface of the entire film. Pee-wee is searching for other Pee-wees. \n \n The film is littered with Easter eggs for the Pee-wee faithful, but it\u2019s a bit of an homage to cinematic weirdos, too. The bank robbers appear to be refugees from a Russ Meyer movie (Pohly\u2019s character takes some styling tips from Tura Satana in Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!), and there\u2019s a touch of John Waters to the unmannered performances and the non-Hollywood looks of the supporting cast. Outside of the film\u2019s potential Large Marge moment\u2014a bit of gloopy CGI that\u2019s raring to traumatize the youngest members of the streaming generation\u2014that lack of polish is where Lee\u2019s touch is most evident. Amid the fantasia that Reubens has spent decades crafting, the director coaxes a strange sort of naturalism out of the cast, which both complements and corresponds to Pee-wee\u2019s manic energy. \n \n Reubens and his collaborators appreciate the allure of the familiar, but they also understand its limitations. When Big Holiday mimics Big Adventure, it\u2019s in an \u201cany note you can reach, I can go higher\u201d fashion: Its Rube Goldberg contraptions spill out of the Herman residence and into the streets of Fairville, and though Mark Mothersbaugh\u2019s instrumental score resembles Danny Elfman\u2019s compositions for Big Adventure, it ups their Raymond Scott quotient. There\u2019s no frame as singularly stirring as Pee-wee\u2019s nocturnal encounter with the Cabazon Dinosaurs; instead, that epic scale is translated to extended comic set-pieces that boldly challenge the \u201cfunny, then not funny, then way funnier than it was before\u201d limits of The Rake Effect. Big Holiday may be a sequel in spirit only, but it definitely subscribes to the \u201clike the first, but bigger\u201d philosophy of other big-screen follow-ups. \n \n From the slow-motion fantasy sequences where Joe Manganiello dons his own version of Pee-wee\u2019s glen-plaid getup, to the finale where the ensemble members gather around their TVs to support the man-child who\u2019s had an effect on each of their lives, Big Holiday is ultimately a testament to the lasting power of Reubens\u2019 signature character. Like Fairville, he exists outside of time, and new generations of Pee-wee fans will be able to stream Big Holiday as part of the same, flat-circle pop-culture timeline as Pee-wee\u2019s Big Adventure and Pee-wee\u2019s Playhouse. For those who\u2019ve stuck with the character after all this time, the movie is an unexpected bonus\u2014one that, cheekily, encourages breaking out of comfort zones every once in a while.",

There's nothing close to as memorable as what can be found in Pee-wee's Big Adventure, he says. \"Holiday can't be considered a big adventure or even a worthwhile nostalgia trip.\" Brian Lowry felt \"an initial rush of nostalgia and enthusiasm, which by the end had given way to silliness fatigue, and the question, 'When will this be over?'\" which might simply be \"a reminder that some things are best consumed in smaller doses,\" he writes at Variety. \"Reubens remains as deft at bringing his man-sized child to life as he ever was,\" but \"the biggest surprise, frankly, might be that the funniest person here is frequently Manganiello.\""

House lawmakers have issued a subpoena to compel former Turing Pharmaceuticals... (Associated Press) \n \n The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is investigating several companies for exorbitant drug price increases, including embattled Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals. \n \n Shkreli became notorious after his company Turing hiked the price of Daraprim, the only approved drug for a rare and sometimes deadly parasitic infection, by 5,000 percent. Since then, Shkreli has been deluged with criticism from patients, politicians and the media, with some labeling him the \"most hated man in America.\" \n \n Last month, the 32-year-old former hedge fund manager was arrested in New York and charged with securities fraud and conspiracy related to another pharmaceutical company he previously ran called Retrophin. Shkreli pleaded not guilty and was released on $5 million bail. He resigned as CEO of Turing, which he founded and ran. \n \n He could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday evening. \n \n The House committee issued the demand January 11 under chairman Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, according to a copy obtained by the Associated Press on Wednesday. \n \n \"I have been trying for the better part of a year to get information from Martin Shkreli about his outrageous price increases, and he has obstructed our investigation at every turn,\" said Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Maryland, the committee's ranking Democrat. \n \n Turing and Valeant Pharmaceuticals both previously refused requests for documents from Cummings and other Democrats. \n \n The committee is also seeking testimony from Turing's chief commercial officer, Nancy Retzlaff, Valeant Pharmaceutical's interim CEO, Howard Schiller, and experts from government and the private sector. Calls placed to New York-based Turing were not immediately returned. \n \n A spokeswoman for Laval, Quebec-based Valeant confirmed that Schiller will testify next week. He was named interim CEO earlier this month after the company's chairman and CEO, J. Michael Pearson, was hospitalized for severe pneumonia. \n \n Concerns about sky-high drug prices have been building for years but boiled over last fall after news reports about Turing, Valeant and a handful of other drugmakers hiking prices of old drugs many times over their prior cost. \n \n Valeant drew Congress' interest following its purchase of the life-saving heart drugs Nitropress and Isuprel. The company, known for gobbling up smaller drugmakers to get their products and then slashing jobs and research programs, jacked up the drugs' prices shortly after buying them from Marathon Pharmaceuticals in February, tripling one and raising the other six-fold. \n \n Daraprim, which Turing acquired in August, is the only approved drug for a life-threatening parasitic infection that mainly strikes pregnant women, cancer patients and AIDS patients. \n \n Amid mounting criticism from patients, doctors and politicians, Shkreli pledged to lower Daraprim's price, but later reneged and instead offered hospitals a 50 percent discount \u2014 still amounting to a 2,500 percent increase. Patients normally take most of the weeklong treatment at home, so they still face the 5,000 percent price increase, though Turing is offering financial aid to those who can't afford the drug. \n \n Both Turing and Valeant have also received multiple subpoenas from federal prosecutors seeking information about drug pricing and other business practices. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports.

Mr. Schiller was appointed by Valeant\u2019s board to temporarily run the company after J. Michael Pearson, its chief executive, was hospitalized late last year with a severe case of pneumonia.

Little, a spokeswoman for Valeant. \n \n At a JPMorgan Chase health care conference last week, Mr. Schiller said he anticipated being called to testify before Congress and added, \u201cyou survive these things and then you move on.\u201d \n \n It is not known if Mr. Shkreli will attend the committee hearing with any lawyers. On Monday, one of his lawyers notified a federal judge in Brooklyn that Mr. Shkreli was replacing his entire legal team at Arnold & Porter and seeking to hire new counsel to represent him in the pending criminal securities fraud case. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

On Twitter, some people branded him the \u201cbad boy of pharma.\u201d Immediately after acquiring the rights to Daraprim, which has been used for decades to treat a life-threatening parasitic infection, Turing raised the price to $750 a tablet from $13.50. \n \n But rather than be shamed by the outrage, Mr. Shkreli seemed to revel in it and defended the decision. Over the next several months, he frequently justified the price increase on Twitter and appeared in many news articles. \n \n He has maintained his public persona even after prosecutors in Brooklyn filed a criminal complaint in mid-December. \n \n In advance of Tuesday\u2019s hearing, Turing and its interim chief executive, Ron Tilles, were asked to produce documents relating to Daraprim from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2015, according to a copy of a Jan. 6 letter sent by the committee.

I've always supported him,\" said the former XXX-rated leading lady. \"For him to lash out at me is shocking.\" \n \n Asked if she was going to press charges, the buxom beauty responded, \"Oh, yeah!\" \n \n \"You have to press charges,\" said Jameson, who is 5-feet-7 and weighs 110 pounds. \"This isn't something you can just get over.\" \n \n Jameson's father, Lawrence Massoli, an ex-Las Vegas cop, said his daughter immediately got a restraining order against Ortiz. \n \n As three cops placed Ortiz in the back of a squad car, the mixed martial arts brawler denied being abusive to Jameson. \n \n \"No,\" he said curtly when asked by a TMZ.com cameraman if he was being arrested for domestic violence. \n \n Massoli said he was at the house, which Ortiz owns, when the abuse occurred and called 911. \n \n Jameson, with her right arm wrapped in a medical brace, said it was the first time Ortiz hit her. \n \n \"I feel completely betrayed,\" Jameson told reporters outside the house. \n \n Asked about her injuries, she said, \"My arm's okay. I'm tough.\" \n \n She declined to disclose what sparked the abuse, but said, \"It wasn't minor.\" \n \n Police went to the two-story Spanish-style home after getting Massoli's 911 call of a \"disturbance\" at 9:53 a.m. \n \n Ortiz, a former Ultimate Fighting light heavyweight champ, was booked at the Huntington Beach Jail. He was expected to be released last night on $50,000 bail. \n \n The charges have jeopardized his career. \"We're going to be fair, but we could cut him,\" Ultimate Fighting boss Dan White told TMZ. \"Other than going on a killing spree, being accused of domestic violence is the worst thing you can have going for you.\" \n \n Jameson - the star of such porn classics as \"I Dream of Jenna\" and \"Hell on Heels\" - has her own home in Hollywood, but spends most of her time at Ortiz's house. \n \n Ortiz and Jameson began dating after meeting on MySpace.com in 2006, shortly after she divorced her second husband, on-screen sex partner Jay Grdina. \n \n In January 2008, Jameson announced she was retiring from porn performing, but would continue to run her $30 million-a-year Internet porn company, ClubJenna.com. \n \n Jameson gave birth March 16, 2009, to Ortiz's twin sons, Jesse Jameson and Journey Jette.

    "input": "Study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, tweeting about vaccines \n \n Bots and Russian trolls spread misinformation about vaccines on Twitter to sow division and distribute malicious content before and during the American presidential election, according to a new study. \n \n Scientists at George Washington University, in Washington DC, made the discovery while trying to improve social media communications for public health workers, researchers said. Instead, they found trolls and bots skewing online debate and upending consensus about vaccine safety. \n \n The study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, as well as marketing and malware bots, tweeting about vaccines. \n \n \n \n Russian trolls played both sides, the researchers said, tweeting pro- and anti-vaccine content in a politically charged context. \n \n \u201cThese trolls seem to be using vaccination as a wedge issue, promoting discord in American society,\u201d Mark Dredze, a team member and professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins, which was also involved in the study, said. \n \n \u201cBy playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases. Viruses don\u2019t respect national boundaries.\u201d \n \n The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, comes as Europe faces one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades, one which has been partly attributed to falling vaccination rates. In the first six months of 2018, there were 41,000 cases of measles across the continent, more than in the entirety of 2017. Meanwhile, the rate of children not receiving vaccines for non-medical reasons is climbing in the US. \n \n \u201cThe vast majority of Americans believe vaccines are safe and effective, but looking at Twitter gives the impression that there is a lot of debate,\u201d said David Broniatowski, an assistant professor in George Washington\u2019s School of Engineering and Applied Science. \n \n \u201cIt turns out that many anti-vaccine tweets come from accounts whose provenance is unclear. These might be bots, human users or \u2018cyborgs\u2019 \u2013 hacked accounts that are sometimes taken over by bots. Although it\u2019s impossible to know exactly how many tweets were generated by bots and trolls, our findings suggest that a significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas.\u201d \n \n Russian trolls appeared to link vaccination to controversial issues in the US. Their vaccine-related content made appeals to God, or argued about race, class and animal welfare, researchers said. Often, the tweets targeted the legitimacy of the US government. \n \n \n \n \u201cDid you know there was secret government database of #Vaccine-damaged child? #VaccinateUS,\u201d read one Russian troll tweet. Another said: \u201c#VaccinateUS You can\u2019t fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I\u2019m for #vaccination!\u201d \n \n \u201cWhereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated anti-vaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord,\u201d researchers concluded. \u201cAccounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination.\u201d \n \n Measles is on the rise in Europe \u2013 and populism could be to blame | Sarah Boseley Read more \n \n Researchers examined a random sample of 1.7m tweets collected between July 2014 and September 2017 \u2013 the height of the American presidential campaign that led to Donald Trump\u2019s victory. To identify bots, researchers compared the rate at which normal users tweeted about vaccines with the rate at which bots and trolls did so. \n \n \u201cWe started looking at the Russian trolls, because that data set became available in January,\u201d said Broniatowski. \u201cOne of the first things that came out was they tweet about vaccines way more often than the average Twitter user.\u201d \n \n Broniatowski said trolls tweeted about vaccines about 22 times more often than regular Twitter users, or about once every 550 tweets, versus every 12,000 tweets for human accounts. \n \n Researchers found different kinds of bots spread different kinds of misinformation. So-called \u201ccontent polluters\u201d used anti-vaccine messages as bait to entice their followers to click on advertisements and links to malicious websites. \n \n The study comes as social media companies struggle to clean their houses of misinformation. In February, Twitter deleted 3,800 accounts linked to the Russian government-backed Internet Research Agency, the same group researchers at George Washington examined. In April, Facebook removed 135 accounts linked to the same organization. \n \n This week, Facebook removed another 650 fake accounts linked to Russia and Iran meant to spread misinformation. Researchers did not study Facebook, though it remains a hub of anti-vaccination activity. \n \n \u201cTo me it\u2019s actually impressive how well-organized and sophisticated the anti-vax movement has become,\u201d said Dr Peter Hotez, the director of the Texas children\u2019s hospital center for vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, and the father of an autistic child. Hotez, who maintains an active Twitter presence, said he struggled to identify whether Twitter accounts were human or bots. \n \n \u201cThere are clearly some well-known anti-vax activists that I know to look out for and I know to block or to mute, but that\u2019s a minority,\u201d said Hotez. \u201cA lot of it just seems to come out of nowhere, and I\u2019m always surprised by that.\u201d \n \n Q&A What is net neutrality? Show Hide Net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) treat everyone\u2019s data equally \u2013 whether that\u2019s an email from your mother, a bank transfer or a streamed episode of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. It means that ISPs don\u2019t get to choose which data is sent more quickly, and which sites get blocked or throttled (for example, slowing the delivery of a TV show because it is streamed by a video company that competes with a subsidiary of the ISP) and who has to pay extra. For this reason, some have described net neutrality as the \u201cfirst amendment of the internet\u201d. \n \n \n \n One of the most striking findings, Broniatowski said, was an apparent attempt by Russian trolls to Astroturf a vaccine debate using the hashtag #VaccinateUS. Accounts identified as controlled by the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm backed by the Russian government, were almost exclusively responsible for content emerging under #VaccinateUS. \n \n Some of the Russian trolls even specifically used a hashtag associated with Andrew Wakefield, the discredited former physician who published fraudulent papers linking vaccines with autism, such as #Vaxxed and #CDCWhistleblower. \n \n What do Russian trolls fear most? Transparency | Paul Chadwick Read more \n \n The Guardian requested comment from Twitter and was referred to a blogpost in which the company said its \u201cfocus is increasingly on proactively identifying problematic accounts\u201d, and that its system \u201cidentified and challenged\u201d more than 9.9m potential spam accounts a week in May 2018. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why has there been a measles outbreak in Europe? \n \n Social media bots and Russian trolls have been spreading disinformation about vaccines on Twitter to create social discord and distribute malware, US researchers say. \n \n Troll accounts that had attempted to influence the US election had also been tweeting about vaccines, a study says. \n \n Many posted both pro- and anti-vaccination messages to create \"false equivalency\", the study found. \n \n It examined thousands of tweets sent between 2014 and 2017. \n \n Vaccination was being used by trolls and sophisticated bots as a \"wedge issue\", said Mark Dredze from Johns Hopkins University. \n \n \"By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases,\" he said. \n \n Earlier this month, the World Health Organization (WHO) said cases of measles in Europe had hit a record high, with experts blaming this surge in infections on a drop in the number of people being vaccinated. \n \n In the US, the number of children being exempted from immunisation for religious or philosophical reasons is also rising, research published in June found. \n \n While a majority of Americans believed vaccines were safe and effective, looking at Twitter gave a different impression and suggested that there was a lot of debate about the issue, the disinformation study, which was published in the American Journal of Public Health, said. \n \n \"A significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas,\" said David Broniatowski from George Washington University. \n \n The researchers reviewed more than 250 tweets about vaccination from accounts linked to the St Petersburg-based Internet Research Agency (IRA). In February the agency was named in a US indictment over alleged election meddling. \n \n The IRA tweets used polarising language and linked vaccination to controversial statements about race, class and government legitimacy, the researchers said. \n \n One tweet casting doubt on vaccines that was cited in the study read: \"Did you know there was secret government database of #Vaccine-damaged child? #VaccinateUS\". \n \n Another that argued for vaccinations said: \"#VaccinateUS You can't fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I'm for #vaccination!\" \n \n Meanwhile less sophisticated \"content polluters\" - bot accounts that distribute malware, unsolicited commercial content and disruptive materials - shared anti-vaccination messages much more frequently than average Twitter users, using them as \"bait\" to get people to click on links to malicious websites. \n \n Social media companies are struggling to find ways to combat disinformation on their platforms. \n \n Earlier this week Facebook and Twitter said they had suspended or removed accounts linked to Iran and Russia over \"inauthentic\" or \"manipulating\" behaviour. \n \n In July Twitter was reported to have shut down up to 70m fake and suspicious accounts. \n \n Health cost of vaccination 'debate' \n \n Despite science overwhelmingly and indisputably advocating in favour of immunisation, a growing number of parents around the world are resisting medical advice by going their own way. \n \n Some base their decision on discredited research 20 years ago that erroneously linked the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) to autism. \n \n But health officials say the number of people getting the disease measles is rising because of a fall in vaccinations. \n \n In Europe more than 41,000 people were infected with measles in the first six months of 2018 - nearly double the number of cases for the whole of last year - leading to 37 deaths. \n \n High rates of measles were seen in Serbia, Ukraine, Georgia and Greece. \n \n In the US the number of children being exempted from vaccines is also rising. \n \n In Italy, the upper house of parliament has voted through legislation to abolish the law that makes vaccination mandatory for children before they start school. The amendment will mean parents of unvaccinated children will no longer face fines. ||||| \u201cDon\u2019t get #vaccines. Illuminati are behind it.\u201d \n \n \u201cDo you still treat your kids with leaves? No? And why don\u2019t you #vaccinate them? It\u2019s medicine!\u201d \n \n With messages like those, Russian internet trolls meddling in the 2016 presidential election also lashed out at Americans debating the safety of vaccines, a new study has found. \n \n But instead of picking a side, researchers said, the trolls and bots they programmed hurled insults at both pro- and anti-vaccine advocates. Their only intent, the study concluded, seemed to be to raise the level of hostility. \n \n \u201cYou see this pattern,\u201d said David A. Broniatowski , a computer engineer at George Washington University and lead author of the study, which was published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. \u201cOn guns, or race, these accounts take opposite sides in lots of debates. They\u2019re about sowing discord.\u201d",
    "reference": "\u2013 You might think twice about heading to Twitter or Facebook to read about vaccinations. \"A significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas,\" says George Washington University's David Broniatowski, author of a new study calling out Russian trolls for seeking to polarize Americans on the issue during 2016 election meddling. Already known to have stirred up issues relating to guns and race, Russia-linked Twitter accounts sent more than 250 tweets offering a pro- or anti-vaccine stance between 2014 and 2017, the BBC reports, citing the study published Thursday in the American Journal of Public Health. Those identified as trolls tweeted about vaccines 22 times more often than regular Twitter users, according to the study, which notes that #VaccinateUS was \"uniquely identified with Russian troll accounts associated with the [Kremlin's] Internet Research Agency,\" per the Guardian and New York Times. \"You can't fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I'm for #vaccination!\" one such tweet read. \"Don\u2019t get #vaccines. Illuminati are behind it,\" read another. \"By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases,\" says researcher Mark Dredze. But the tweets are really about sowing discord, says Broniatowski, noting that many IRA-linked tweets about vaccines also mentioned, race, class, and the US government.

    "input": "By Mark Hosenball \n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Central Intelligence Agency was involved in a spying operation against Germany that led to the alleged recruitment of a German intelligence official and has prompted renewed outrage in Berlin, two U.S. officials familiar with the matter said on Monday. \n \n CIA Director John Brennan has asked to brief key members of the U.S. Congress on the matter, which threatens a new rupture between Washington and a close European ally, one of the officials said. \n \n It was unclear if and when Brennan's briefing to U.S. lawmakers would take place. The CIA declined any comment on the matter. \n \n The office of Germany's Federal Prosecutor, based in the western city of Karlsruhe, late last week issued a statement saying that a 31-year old man had been arrested on suspicion of being a foreign spy, and that investigations were continuing. The statement offered no further details. \n \n German politicians have said that the suspect, an employee of the country's foreign intelligence service, admitted passing to an American contact details concerning a German parliamentary committee's investigation of alleged U.S. eavesdropping disclosed by Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the U.S. National Security Agency. \n \n The U.S. officials who confirmed the CIA's role spoke on condition of anonymity, and offered no further details. \n \n White House press secretary Josh Earnest declined comment on the dispute. ||||| A suspected double agent under arrest in Germany has been spying for the CIA for two years, German intelligence officials investigating the case now believe. \n \n \u201cAll the evidence suggests that he was working for the Americans,\u201d an unnamed senior security official has told Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper. \n \n The country's top security official has demanded a full American response to German investigations. \"I expect everyone now to assist quickly in clearing up the accusations - and quick and clear statements, from the USA too,\" Thomas de Maiziere, the Interior minister said. \n \n Germany's Foreign Ministry summoned the America ambassador on Friday but German authorities have confirmed only that a 31-year-old man is under arrest. \n \n The first indications that investigators believe a confession by the arrested man is true. If the suspicions against him are confirmed, the case could cause grave damage to US-German relations. \n \n The arrested man, who is severely disabled, worked in the Foreign Relations department of Germany\u2019s BND intelligence service, where he had access to classified documents and information about agents abroad. \n \n For the last two years, he has been sending documents to the Americans electronically once a week, according to Bild newspaper. \n \n In a damning piece of evidence, investigators said they had found an encrypted communication programme hidden on his computer. \n \n The hidden programme was disguised as a weather app, and activated by searching for a weather forecast for New York. \n \n The arrested man was able to carry on most communications electronically, but met with an American contact in Austria on two or three occasions, when he received payments of \u20ac25,000 in cash. \n \n Other reports said German intelligence asked their American counterparts for help unmasking their own mole \u2013 and the Americans remained silent. \n \n The man was caught after an anonymous email he sent offering to sell classified information to the Russians was intercepted. \n \n German intelligence officials posing as Russians tried to entice the man to a meeting, but he refused. \n \n The Germans then requested American help tracing the sender of the email, but they got not reply. In the meantime, German intelligence successfully identified the man. \n \n Convinced they were hunting down a Russian agent, they were astonished when he confessed he to spying for the Americans. \n \n News of the arrest has been greeted with fury in a Germany still reeling from the revelation that the NSA spied on Chancellor Angela \n \n Merkel\u2019s phone calls, and American officials have conceded that it threatens to undo all their efforts to repair relations. \n \n Mrs Merkel has yet to comment publicly on the case, but business leaders accomanying her on a trip to China told Spiegel she was \u201csurprised and stunned\u201d. \n \n Germany\u2019s president, Joachim Gauck, has given an angry TV interview in which he accuses the US of \u201cplaying games with our friendship\u201d and says if it is proved the arrested man spied for the Americans, Germany must \u201csay enough is enough, for once\u201d. \n \n Germany is to demand all joint intelligence staff at the US embassy in Berlin be replaced, according to Bild, and has not ruled out insisting on a change of ambassador.",

Discussion of the shooting begins at 11:26, when a dispatcher mentions hearing about the incident \"on the news,\" and at minute 44, which contains audio from 1:35 p.m. - 2:05 p.m., the dispatcher says \"we are switching over to the riot channel.\" \n \n It's likely any chatter regarding the actual shooting will be found in the Ferguson Police Department's audio dispatches.

The mistake was caused by the fact that at the time of my judgement, I was presented with a number of documents which without being seen in connection with the general material of the orders, must give an incorrect picture. \n \n It is not true that I was personally of such a high rank as to be able to persecute, or that I myself was a persecutor in the pursuit of the Jews, in the face of such an abundant rule it is clear the judges in their ruling ignored the fact that I never served in such a high position as required to be involved independently in such decisive responsibilities. Nor did I give any order in my own name, but only ever acted \u2018by order of\u2019. \n \n Even had I been as the judges assessed the driving, zealous, force in the persecution of the Jews, such a thing would have been evident in my promotion and other awards. Yet I received no such advantages. \n \n It is also incorrect that I was never influenced by human emotions. \n \n Specifically under the impression of the unspeakable horrors which I witnessed, I immediately requested a transfer to a different post. Similarly, I revealed of my own will during the police investigation, horrors which had been till then unknown in order to help establish the undisputable truth. \n \n I declare once again, as I did in the presence of the court: I detest as the greatest of crimes the horrors which were perpetrated against the Jews and think it right that the initiators of these terrible deeds will stand trial before the law now and in the future. \n \n Notwithstanding there is a need to draw a line between the leaders responsible and the people like me forced to serve as mere instruments in the hands of the leaders. I was not a responsible leader, and as such do not feel myself guilty. \n \n I am not able to recognise the court\u2019s ruling as just, and I ask, Your Honour Mr. President, to exercise your right to grant pardons, and order that the death penalty not be carried out. \n \n Adolf Eichmann \n \n Jerusalem, 29.5.62 ||||| High-ranking Nazi Adolf Eichmann requested a pardon from Israel's president Yitzhak Ben-Zvi two days before was hanged to death, rare documents released in honor of International Holocaust Remembrance Day showed on Wednesday. \n \n Eichmann made the request after being found guilty of 15 charges, including crimes against the Jewish people, crimes against humanity and war crimes. \n \n Follow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter \n \n \n \n The document is one of several released ahead of an event scheduled for Wednesday at the President's Residence.

Had I been, as the judges assume, the fanatical driving force in the persecution of the Jews, this should have been reflected in a promotion and other rewards, but I was never granted any benefit. A line must be drawn between the leaders who are responsible and people like me, who were forced to be tools by the leadership. I was not in charge of things, and therefore I do not feel that I am guilty. And I ask of you, honorable president, to use your right of pardon and order that this death sentence not be carried out.\" \n \n \n \n Presiding Judges Yitzhak Raveh, Benjamin Halevi, and Moshe Landau \n \n Vera Eichmann, the notorious Nazi's wife, also wrote to Ben-Tzi with a request for a pardon \"as a fire and mother to four children\". A letter by Eichmann's five brothers was attached to Adolf's letter, which argued that the trial exposed the horrors of the past to the world. \"If people thus attain tolerance and an understanding of brotherhood, the purpose of the trial was achieved. As a conclusion to this worldwide rebuke, an act of mercy would emphasize the altruism of the Jewish people and help it by means of advancing friendship between peoples and races.\" \n \n Eichmann's German attorney, Dr. Robert Servatius, noted in the request that his client was \"an unimportant person who was thrust by fate into political events.\" The lawyer added that the court had not taken into account the historical context of events, which he claimed were grounds for overturning the death sentence. \"The condemned did not act out of a position of anti-Semitism, but because he was bound by the bureaucratic coercion system.\" \n \n Ben-Zvi rejected the request in a concise letter. \"After considering the parson requests submitted regarding the Adolf Eichmann case, and after I gave my attention to all the materials available to me, I reached the conclusion that there is no justification for giving Eichmann a pardon or mitigate the punishment passed down by the Jerusalem District Court on December 15, 1961, and which was approved by the Supreme Court on May 29, 1962,\" wrote Ben-Zvi. \"Thus, I am informing you that I have decided to refuse the requests and not use my powers to pardon and reduce punishments in this case.\" \n \n Also revealed was the handwritten text of then-attorney general Gideon Hausner's opening statement. \"When I stand before you, judges of Israel, to lead the prosecution of Adolf Eichmann, I do not stand alone,\" Hausner said in the memorable statement. |With me here are six million accusers. But they cannot rise to their feet and point their finger at the man in the dock with the cry 'J'accuse!' on their lips.

    "input": "A CAR park in a Highland town has been confirmed by archaeologists as the meeting place of a medieval Norse parliament. \n \n Excavations at the Cromartie Memorial car park in Dingwall uncovered evidence of a mound that archaeologists believe was established in the 11th century as a gathering spot for a Viking parliament, known as a \u201cThing\u201d. \n \n Picture: Contributed \n \n When it was constructed the \u201cThing\u201d would have been on a man-made islet in the estuary of the River Pefferey, historians claimed. They believe the mound was built on the instructions of Thorfinn the Mighty, a powerful Viking earl who died in 1065. \n \n He is thought to have laid the foundations of what would later become the royal burgh of Dingwall in Ross-shire. \n \n It is only the second time a \u201cThing\u201d site has been uncovered in the UK. Yesterday historians said the discovery would help them learn more about the Norse Vikings, who battled for control of land across the north of Scotland. \n \n David MacDonald, of Dingwall History Society, which was part of the dig partnership, said that a road, a ditch and an aqueduct, known as the Water of Dyke, that drew water from hillside springs, were also constructed when Thorfinn was in control of Ross-shire. \n \n He said Thorfinn\u2019s rise to power was aided by his victory in a battle at Torfnes on the south side of the Cromarty Firth, possibly against MacBeth\u2019s troops. At the height of his power, Thorfinn became Lord of Caithness, Shetland and Orkney. \n \n The origins of the town of Dingwall as a Viking Thing-site had long puzzled historians and archaeologists alike, with many believing it was elsewhere on the Black Isle in Ross-shire. \n \n But now the results of the archaeological dig, the culmination of Highland Council\u2019s participation as a partner in the EU Northern Periphery International Thing Project, has come up with real answers. \n \n Mr MacDonald said: \u201cYou can call this the official confirmation of the car park being the location of a \u2018Thing\u2019. \n \n \u201cIt has been very exciting over the years, but all the historical research points in this direction.\u201d \n \n In recent times historical investigation identified the Cromartie car park \u2013 which contains the burial place and memorial monument of George, first earl of Cromartie, who died in 1714 \u2013 as the site of the long lost Moothill of Dingwall, the town\u2019s medieval meeting place. This has now been confirmed as deriving from the Viking Thing-mound. \n \n A trial trench excavation in the car park in 2012 showed significant radio-carbon datings. \n \n According to archaeologist Dr Oliver O\u2019Grady, a leading authority on the assembly mounds of Scotland, who was part of the dig : \u201cThe excavations have confirmed the presence of important archaeological remains and indicated that the mound was man-made and probably created during the 11th century. \n \n \u201cThe radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider North-east Scotland. \n \n \u201cThe lack of substantial occupation remains or burial activity is also further circumstantial evidence that the mound was created for an assembly site or Thing. \n \n \u201cThe substantial manpower and effort required to create a monument on the scale of the Dingwall mound would also seem in keeping with the establishment of a major regional judicial and administrative centre.\u201d \n \n Dingwall, which lies at the head of the Cromarty Firth, is a location on a European tourist trail of Thing sites. Funded by the EU, the Thing Sites GeoTour involves Scotland, Norway, Iceland, the Faroes and Isle of Man. ||||| A parking lot in Scotland was once the site of a Viking parliament, new research suggests \n \n A Viking parliamentary site that dates to the 11th century has been found beneath a parking lot in Scotland. \n \n The site, located in the town of Dingwall, Scotland, was dubbed a \"Thing\" site, referring to its name in antiquity. Like other Thing sites, this one was likely a place where ancient Norsemen gathered to settle legal disputes, uphold laws and make key political decisions. \n \n \"It's a fantastic find, really,\" said Oliver J. T. O'Grady, the director of the site's excavations and an archaeologist who runs an archaeological consulting firm called OJT Heritage. \"No one's had dating [information] from a Thing site in Scotland.\" \n \n The Thing \n \n Historians had long wondered whether Dingwall was a site of a Viking parliamentary gathering known as the Thing because the word Dingwall probably originated from the word thingvellir, which means \"the field of the assembly.\" [Fierce Fighters: 7 Secrets of Viking Culture] \n \n Such Thing sites are scattered from Iceland to Norway to the Shetland Islands, and Norsemen traveled from far and wide to get to the seasonal gatherings, often to settle disputes that would otherwise end in bloodshed. But Things were held mostly at open-air fields, and people only stayed temporarily, leaving relatively few archaeological traces of their presence. \n \n \"Many archaeologists have said, 'How do you find the archaeology of a bunch of people gathering together?'\" O'Grady told LiveScience. \n \n O'Grady and his colleagues at The Thing Project, which works on similar sites around Europe, were not deterred, because traces of temporary dwelling booths had turned up at other Thing sites. \n \n Digging up democracy \n \n Using historical records, the team found a mound near the inlet of an estuary in Dingwall that was called the moothill, or assembly mound, in the 13th century. Later on, Scottish earls were buried there. In 1947, local authorities bulldozed the top of the mound and turned the area into a parking lot. (Parking lots seem to be rich sources of history in the U.K. \u2014 Richard III's skeleton was found underneath a parking lot, as was a medieval knight in Scotland.) \n \n The team dug a small trench across the mound and used radioactive carbon isotopes, or atoms of carbon with different molecular weights, to date the charcoal found in the soil. (These radioactive isotopes decay at different rates and can be used to date soils and objects.) \n \n The team found that some of the upper layers of the soil date to the medieval period, likely when it was called the moothill, and contain shards of pottery and fragments of an iron vessel. \n \n A site in Dingwall, Scotland, revealed traces of a 13th century iron vessel underneath a parking lot. Credit: Dr. Oliver J. T. O'Grady \n \n But below that, the team found the first layers that were used to construct the mound, with soil dating to around the 11th century. \n \n By this period of history, the Vikings were no longer feared marauders sailing the seas and raiding Europe. Instead, the people who gathered at Dingwall were more likely subjects of Norse kings who ruled from the Orkney and Shetland Islands. \n \n No one knows yet who built the site, though the sheer size of the mound suggests it was a fairly significant undertaking that required a lot of political power and resources. \n \n No historical documents mention a Thing gathering site near the region, but Earl Thorfinn the Mighty came down from the Orkney Islands at the time and fought a battle in the general region. \n \n \"He would certainly have had a political reason to make a statement,\" O'Grady said. \n \n Follow Tia Ghose on Twitter and Google+.

That name had long clued archaeologists into the potential for such a find: Dingwall is likely derived from the word thingvellir, or \"the field of the assembly,\" LiveScience reports. But finding a \"Thing\" site is no small task, in part because the gatherings usually occurred in open fields, and the temporary nature of them meant only modest traces of human life were left behind. Indeed, this is only the second \"Thing\" found in the UK, the Scotsman reports. It was uncovered after the team used historical records to identify a mound that had once been called the \"assembly mound\"; a parking lot now covers it. Excavations \"indicated that the mound was man-made,\" likely in the 11th century, says site director Oliver JT O'Grady, and \"radio-carbon datings provide strong scientific evidence to support the interpretation that the mound was created during the period of late Norwegian political influence in Ross-shire and wider.\" He and his team aren't exactly sure who built the site, but based on its size, that creator would have needed both \"political power and resources,\" explains LiveScience.

Biden trailed well behind, in the 62nd percentile. (Obama was considered too big a name in 2007, so he wasn't included.) And while the study used a different scale for the House, Paul Ryan was ranked: He scored in the 67th percentile among 2004 House candidates. The best-looking politician? Sen. John Thune of South Dakota."

    "input": "It all seems rather mad, doesn't it? The decision to become involved militarily in the Libyan civil war couldn't take place within a less hospitable context. The U.S. is reeling from spending and deficits, we're already in two wars, our military has been stretched to the limit, we're restive at home, and no one, really, sees President Obama as the kind of leader you'd follow over the top. \"This way, men!\" \"No, I think I'll stay in my trench.\" People didn't hire him to start battles but to end them. They didn't expect him to open new fronts. Did he not know this? \n \n He has no happy experience as a rallier of public opinion and a leader of great endeavors; the central initiative of his presidency, the one that gave shape to his leadership, health care, is still unpopular and the cause of continued agitation. When he devoted his entire first year to it, he seemed off point and out of touch. \n \n This was followed by the BP oil spill, which made him look snakebit. Now he seems incompetent and out of his depth in foreign and military affairs. He is more observed than followed, or perhaps I should say you follow him with your eyes and not your heart. So it's funny he'd feel free to launch and lead a war, which is what this confused and uncertain military action may become. \n \n What was he thinking? What is he thinking? \n \n Which gets me to Mr. Obama's speech, the one he hasn't given. I cannot for the life of me see how an American president can launch a serious military action without a full and formal national address in which he explains to the American people why he is doing what he is doing, why it is right, and why it is very much in the national interest. He referred to his aims in parts of speeches and appearances when he was in South America, but now he's home. More is needed, more is warranted, and more is deserved. He has to sit at that big desk and explain his thinking, put forward the facts as he sees them, and try to garner public support. He has to make a case for his own actions. It's what presidents do! And this is particularly important now, because there are reasons to fear the current involvement will either escalate and produce a lengthy conflict or collapse and produce humiliation. \n \n Without a formal and extended statement, the air of weirdness, uncertainty and confusion that surrounds this endeavor will only deepen. \n \n The questions that must be answered actually start with the essentials. What, exactly, are we doing? Why are we doing it? At what point, or after what arguments, did the president decide U.S. military involvement was warranted? Is our objective practical and doable? What is America's overriding strategic interest? In what way are the actions taken, and to be taken, seeing to those interests? \n \n Matthew Kaminski of the editorial board explains America's role in the Libyan campaign. \n \n From those questions flow many others. We know who we're against\u2014Moammar Gadhafi, a bad man who's done very wicked things. But do we know who we're for? That is, what does the U.S. government know or think it knows about the composition and motives of the rebel forces we're attempting to assist? For 42 years, Gadhafi controlled his nation's tribes, sects and groups through brute force, bribes and blandishments. What will happen when they are no longer kept down? What will happen when they are no longer oppressed? What will they become, and what role will they play in the coming drama? Will their rebellion against Gadhafi degenerate into a dozen separate battles over oil, power and local dominance? \n \n What happens if Gadhafi hangs on? The president has said he wants U.S. involvement to be brief. But what if Gadhafi is fighting on three months from now? \n \n On the other hand, what happens if Gadhafi falls, if he's deposed in a palace coup or military coup, or is killed, or flees? What exactly do we imagine will take his place? \n \n Supporters of U.S. intervention have argued that if we mean to protect Libya's civilians, as we have declared, then we must force regime change. But in order to remove Gadhafi, they add, we will need to do many other things. We will need to provide close-in air power. We will probably have to put in special forces teams to work with the rebels, who are largely untrained and ragtag. The Libyan army has tanks and brigades and heavy weapons. The U.S. and the allies will have to provide the rebels training and give them support. They will need antitank missiles and help in coordinating air strikes. \n \n Once Gadhafi is gone, will there be a need for an international peacekeeping force to stabilize the country, to provide a peaceful transition, and to help the post-Gadhafi government restore its infrastructure? Will there be a partition? Will Libyan territory be altered? \n \n None of this sounds like limited and discrete action. \n \n In fact, this may turn out to be true: If Gadhafi survives, the crisis will go on and on. If Gadhafi falls, the crisis will go on and on. \n \n Everyone who supports the Libyan endeavor says they don't want an occupation. One said the other day, \"We're not looking for a protracted occupation.\" \n \n Protracted? \n \n Mr. Obama has apparently set great store in the fact that he was not acting alone, that Britain, France and Italy were eager to move. That's good\u2014better to work with friends and act in concert. But it doesn't guarantee anything. A multilateral mistake is still a mistake. So far the allied effort has not been marked by good coordination and communication. If the conflict in Libya drags on, won't there tend to be more fissures, more tension, less commitment and more confusion as to objectives and command structures? Could the unanticipated results of the Libya action include new strains, even a new estrangement, among the allies? \n \n How might Gadhafi hit out, in revenge, in his presumed last days, against America and the West? \n \n And what, finally, about Congress? Putting aside the past half-century's argument about declarations of war, doesn't Congress, as representative of the people, have the obvious authority and responsibility to support the Libyan endeavor, or not, and to authorize funds, or not? \n \n These are all big questions, and there are many other obvious ones. If the Libya endeavor is motivated solely by humanitarian concerns, then why haven't we acted on those concerns recently in other suffering nations? It's a rough old world out there, and there's a lot of suffering. What is our thinking going forward? What are the new rules of the road, if there are new rules? Were we, in Libya, making a preemptive strike against extraordinary suffering\u2014suffering beyond what is inevitable in a civil war? \n \n America has been through a difficult 10 years, and the burden of proof on the need for U.S. action would be with those who supported intervention. Chief among them, of course, is the president, who made the decision as commander in chief. He needs to sit down and tell the American people how this thing can possibly turn out well. He needs to tell them why it isn't mad. ||||| BENGHAZI, Libya -- France declared Libya's airspace \"under control\" on Friday, after NATO agreed to take command of the no-fly zone in a compromise that appeared to set up dual command centers and possibly new confusion. Coalition warplanes struck Moammar Gadhafi's forces outside the strategic eastern gateway city of Ajdabiya. \n \n (SCROLL DOWN FOR UPDATES) \n \n Representatives for the regime and the rebels were expected to meet formally for the first time Friday, in Ethiopia, in what the U.N. described as a part of an effort to reach a cease-fire and political solution.The overnight French and British strikes on an artillery battery and armored vehicles were intended to give a measure of relief to Ajdabiya, where residents have fled or cowered under more than a week of shelling and fighting between rebels and government troops. Explosions also could be heard in Tripoli, the Libyan capital, before daybreak Friday, apparently from airstrikes. \n \n \"Libyan airspace is under control, and we proved it yesterday, because a Libyan plane in the hands of pro-Gadhafi forces, which had just taken off from Misrata in order to bomb Misrata, was destroyed by a French Rafale,\" Adm. Edouard Guillaud said on France-Info radio. \n \n But the compromise that puts NATO in charge of clearing the skies still leaves the U.S. responsible for the more difficult task of planning attacks on Gadhafi's ground forces and other targets. \n \n Ajdabiya has been under siege for more than a week, with the rebels holding the city center and scattered checkpoints but facing relentless shelling from government troops on the outskirts. Residents are without electicity or drinking water, and many have fled. \n \n The U.S. military said coalition jets flew about 150 on Thursday, about 70 of them with American planes. \n \n \"The operation is still focusing on tanks, combat vehicles, air defense targets \u2013 really whatever equipment and personnel are threatening the no-fly zone or civilians on the ground in such locations as Ajdabiya and along some other areas on the coast,\" Marine Corps Capt. Clint Gebke told reporters from aboard the USS Mount Whitney. \n \n The U.S. has been trying to give up the lead role in the operation against Gadhafi's forces, and NATO agreed late Thursday to assume one element of it \u2013 control of the no-fly zone. \n \n \"Nearly all, some 75 percent of the combat air patrol missions in support of the no-fly zone, are now being executed by our coalition partners,\" Navy Vice Adm. William Gortney, told reporters at the Pentagon. Other countries were handling less than 10 percent of such missions, he said. \n \n U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the United Arab Emirates would deploy 12 planes for the coalition effort. Clinton thanked the U.A.E. for becoming the second Arab country after Qatar to send planes. \n \n Qatar and U.A.E. are expected to start flying air patrols over Libya by this weekend. \n \n Libyan state television showed blackened and mangled bodies that it said were victims of airstrikes in Tripoli. Rebels have accused Gadhafi's forces of taking bodies from the morgue and pretending they were civilian casualties. \n \n A U.S. intelligence report on Monday, the day after coalition missiles attacked Gadhafi's Bab al-Aziziya compound in the capital, said that a senior Gadhafi aide was told to take bodies from a morgue and place them at the scene of the bomb damage, to be displayed for visiting journalists. A senior U.S. defense official revealed the contents of the intelligence report on condition of anonymity because it was classified secret. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Hadeel al-Shalchi in Tripoli, Libya; Angela Charlton in Paris; and Robert Burns in Washington; contributed to this report. ||||| President Barack Obama is resisting pressure to deliver an Oval Office speech explaining his policy on Libya \u2014 in part, because he doesn\u2019t want to equate what he regards as a smaller, time-limited mission with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. \n \n Administration officials haven\u2019t ruled out a big speech, but Obama is reluctant to make a major address on Libya until the United States hands over most command and combat duties to its allies. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset VIDEO: HRC update on Libya, NATO POLITICO 44 \n \n That\u2019s not to say the president won\u2019t talk about Libya over the next few days, aides say, but he\u2019s not likely to succumb to pressure to deliver a long, explanatory address to outline his elusive endgame to the nation until the path ahead becomes clearer. \n \n There were signs that might come sooner rather than later on Thursday. For the first time since combat operations began, the vast majority of flights over Libya on Thursday were conducted by U.S. allies, a sharp contrast to the previous 24 hours when American planes flew the majority of missions. \n \n And NATO member nations on Thursday evening approved a plan under which the alliance will assume command of the no-fly zone over Libya. \n \n \u201cWe are already seeing a significant reduction in the number of U.S. planes involved in the operation as the number of planes from other countries increase,\u201d Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said after the decision by NATO. \u201cToday we are taking the next step. All 28 allies have also now authorized military authorities to develop an operations plan for NATO to take on the broader civilian protections mission.\u201d \n \n Clinton\u2019s reassuring assessment masked a ferocious round of last-minute negotiations, culminating in a four-way call between Clinton and the foreign ministers of Britain, France and Turkey on Thursday afternoon that sealed a preliminary deal. \n \n \u201cThis was a hard diplomatic battle,\u201d a senior administration official said. \u201cBuilding consensus among 29 nations is never easy.\u201d \n \n Whatever happens, Obama is intent on putting the U.S. in the back seat. As part of an effort to downplay the scope of U.S. involvement, administration officials have flatly refused to call the enforcement of the Libyan no-fly, no-drive zone \u2014 which has included the launch of more than hundred cruise missiles and dozens of U.S. aircraft sorties \u2014 a \u201cwar.\u201d \n \n It is \u201ca time-limited, scope-limited military action,\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said Thursday. \n \n Still, the lack of a clearly articulated endgame \u2014 or even a rationale for quickly committing U.S. naval and air assets in a third Muslim nation \u2014 is making House and Senate members in both parties increasingly uneasy. \n \n Their main concern: That Obama\u2019s oft-stated goal of ousting Qadhafi isn\u2019t backed up by the U.N. resolution, which calls only for the use of force in establishing a no-fly-zone and protecting civilians, putting U.S. forces in awkward suspension between humanitarian goals and regime change.",

It\u2019s usually hot, and despite the fact that we are Tetrised in there, all of us are trying desperately to pretend that we are completely alone. Rarely do I give thanks for the experience, but this year marks the 155th anniversary of the London Underground, that efficient marvel of public transport. \n \n On January 9, 1863, the world\u2019s first-ever underground railway train, steam-operated, pulled out of Paddington Station, and rumbled 3.5 miles down the tubular tunnel to Farringdon Station. The line, which was financed by Metropolitan Railway, was an instant success: Approximately 40,000 people lined up for the novelty of riding a train underground. Within six months, 26,000 people were riding the train each day. \n \n By 1884, there were more than 800 trains in operation in what was called the Inner Circle, a circular line that enclosed central London and that is now just the Circle Line. And now, with more than five times that number of trains operating and millions of people safely and swiftly reaching their destinations every day, the London Underground is truly a modern miracle of efficient transport. Here are 18 impressive facts and figures you might not have known about the London Tube. \n \n 1. THE MAJORITY OF THE LONDON UNDERGROUND IS NOT UNDERGROUND. \n \n \n \n iStock \n \n The entire London Underground network is approximately 249 miles long, employing more than 4100 trains, and linking 270 stations. But only about 45 percent of those miles are underground. \n \n 2. EACH TRAIN TRAVELS ABOUT 114,500 MILES A YEAR. \n \n Each Tube train travels an average of 114,500 miles a year, or 4.6 times around the world. The longest distance between adjacent stations is approximately 3.9 miles, between Chesham to Chalfont & Latimer. The shortest distance is about 984 feet, between Leicester Square and Covent Garden on the Picadilly Line (and since Covent Garden is usually mobbed, you\u2019re better off getting off at Leicester Square and walking). \n \n 3. MORE THAN 1 BILLION JOURNEYS ARE MADE EACH YEAR. \n \n Each year, about 1.3 billion journeys are made on the London Underground. The busiest station in the network is Waterloo, which sees about 100.3 million passengers per year; the least used is Roding Valley. \n \n 4. HALF A MILLION MICE CALL THE UNDERGROUND HOME. \n \n An estimated 500,000 mice live in the tunnels, but they\u2019re not the only pests\u2014the mosquitoes that live in the Tube are of a different and somewhat more vicious species than their aboveground cousins. Called Culex pipiens molestus, they\u2019re supposedly known for their voracious appetites. \n \n 5. THERE AE SOME GHOSTS REPORTEDLY LIVING DOWN THERE, TOO. \n \n The London Underground is also supposedly home to a group of subterranean Londoners, who, just like the Mole People of New York\u2019s Subway, took to the tunnels and mutated. The Tube is also reportedly home to a host of ghostly apparitions, including the Faceless Woman of Beacontree Station, the Toothy Man of Channelsea Depot, and the Screaming Spectre of Farringdon Station. \n \n 6. THE AVERAGE LONDONER SPENDS 11.5 DAYS OF EACH YEAR ON THE TUBE. \n \n The average Londoner spends an average of about 11.5 days each year on the Underground\u20145.2 of those days in the Underground\u2019s underground tunnels. (What\u2019s unknown is how many hours of those days are spent stopped underground, waiting for a signal failure to be resolved, another train to move along, or for whatever bit of rubbish that has been thrown on the tracks at the station ahead of you to be cleared.) \n \n 7. THE FASTEST TRAINS TRAVEL AT SPEEDS OF OVER 60 MILES PER HOUR. \n \n The fastest line is the Metropolitan, where trains can reach speeds of more than 60 miles per hour, but the average speed of a London Underground train is only around 20.5 miles per hour. \n \n 8. THE DEEPEST STATION IS NEARLY 200 FEET BELOW STREET LEVEL. \n \n The deepest Underground station is Hampstead, on the Northern Line, which is located nearly 192 feet below street level. There\u2019s an elevator, of course, but also an emergency spiral staircase featuring more than 320 steps, in case of emergency (or a fit of exercise mania). \n \n 9. IN 1969, QUEEN ELIZABETH TOOK CONTROL OF THE VICTORIA LINE. \n \n In 1969, Queen Elizabeth II commemorated the opening of the Victoria Line by driving one of the new trains from Green Park to Oxford Circus. It was her second ride ever on a London Underground train, the first being when she was 13 and accompanied by her sister and governess. Presumably her stint as Tube driver was without incident as eight years later, the Queen was again allowed in the cab of a Picadilly Line train when she presided over the opening of the line\u2019s extension. \n \n 10. THE FIRST ESCALATOR WAS A MISERABLE FAILURE. \n \n The Underground\u2019s first real escalator was built in 1911 at Earl\u2019s Court, but four years before that, a spiral escalator was installed at Holloway Road Station. It didn\u2019t last very long\u2014in fact, it only lasted a day of testing and never actually saw public use. Its remains are held at the London Transport Museum\u2019s Depot, which is only open to the public a few times per year. \n \n 11. THE LONGEST ESCALATOR IS NEARLY 200 FEET LONG. \n \n The longest escalator at any Underground station is the 197-foot-long moving stair at Angel, in Islington, on the Northern line. \n \n 12. PEOPLE HAVE LEFT A LOT OF WEIRD THINGS ON THE TRAINS. \n \n Among the strangest things left on the Underground and collected by the Lost Property Office: A jar of bull semen; outboard motor; three dead bats in a container; a vasectomy kit; a harpoon gun, which may have gone with the 14-foot long boat; a stuffed eagle; breast implants; false teeth and a surprising number of prosthetic limbs; a four-foot tall Mickey Mouse; six full-sized mannequins; and an urn containing a dead man\u2019s ashes, which was reunited with his brother five years after it was lost. \n \n 13. JERRY SPRINGER WAS BORN AT HIGHGATE STATION. \n \n Politician-turned-trash talk show host Jerry Springer was born at Highgate Station on the Northern Line on February 13, 1944, when his mother sought shelter during a Luftwaffe raid during World War II. \n \n 14. MANY PEOPLE USED TUBE STATIONS ARE AIR RAID SHELTERS DURING WORLD WAR II, EVEN THOUGH THE GOVERNMENT BANNED THE PRACTICE. \n \n Speaking of air raids: At the start of the London Blitz, Germany\u2019s nightly bombing raids on the British capital in September 1939, the government banned people from using the Tube stations as air raid shelters, claiming that the stations should be reserved only for transport. People got around the ban by simply buying a ticket and refusing to the leave the platform. A month later, the government realized that the ban was unenforceable at best and cruel at worst, and gave the go-ahead for stations to be used as shelters. \n \n By the end of the war, sheltering in the Underground had became so regular that a ticketing scheme was introduced to keep people from panicking at the queues, and more than 22,000 bunk beds were installed in stations across the system to provide places for them to sleep. \n \n 15. ITS ICONIC MAP WAS INSPIRED BY A CIRCUIT BOARD. \n \n \n \n iStock \n \n The London Underground\u2019s iconic map, which bears no relationship to actual topographical or geographical features, was designed in 1933 by Harry Beck. Beck, an engineering draftsman who worked in the London Underground\u2019s signals office, was supposedly inspired by electronic circuit boards, and saw ways of tidying up the lines. But the department rejected the initial proposal, claiming it was too radical, and Beck was paid a paltry less than $15 for his work. Two years and some modifications later, however, the Underground adopted the map and has used it ever since.",
    "reference": "\u2013 In 1992, a 9,000-word diary was found in the floorboards of a home in England containing a detailed confession to murders tied to Jack the Ripper, the serial killer who terrorized London for 10 weeks in 1888. It ended thusly: \"I give my name that all know of me, so history do tell, what love can do to a gentleman born. Yours Truly, Jack The Ripper.\" It appears to belong to wealthy Liverpool cotton Merchant James Maybrick, who died a year later, but many experts dismissed the tell-all tome as a sophisticated forgery. Now, the Telegraph reports, a team led by writer and film director Bruce Robinson has unearthed timecards that show which electricians were working on Maybrick's home, Battlecrease House, on March 9, 1992, the morning the book was said to have been found. The man who came up with the diary, scrap metal dealer Mike Barrett, claimed to have gotten it through a family friend who died soon thereafter, leading many to believe it was a fake. But Barrett was a colorful character who frequented the Saddle Inn public house in Anfield, where one of the electricians working on Battlecrease House was also a regular. Because Barrett fancied himself a writer, it is believed that the electricians who found the book passed it onto Barrett, who then famously contacted a London literary agent that very day in March claiming he had Jack the Ripper's diary, adds the Sun. Mental Floss notes that many suspects have been proposed over the decades, including a former royal obstetrician. (The Ripper's last known victim remains mysterious.)"

If every bit of the metals is retrieved, researchers reported there could be $280 per ton of sludge. \n \n \u201cWhile we expected that the metals were present at low concentration, the fact that the small amounts represent such a significant economic value was definitely surprising,\u201d says Pierre Herckes, associate professor at ASU and co-author of the study. Of the $13 million, $2.6 million alone comes from gold and silver. \n \n \n \n It\u2019s possible that the metals found in sewage \u2014 which is basically anything that is flushed down a drain or toilet \u2014 is a result of discharge from jewelry and electronics manufacturing plants, mining, electroplating, and similar industries. After sewage is treated, 60% of the remaining sludge is spread across fields, yards, and forests throughout the country as fertilizer, with the rest sent to landfills or incinerated. \n \n The concentration of metals in sludge, however, could pose environmental risks, so finding a way to extract them would help mitigate the effects of the gold flush \u2014 err, rush. \n \n In 2009, a waste treatment facility in central Japan managed to extract nearly 2 kilograms of gold from the ash of incinerated sludge, which was more than the amount pulled from Japan\u2019s Hishikari Mine, one of the world\u2019s top gold mines. \n \n However, no U.S. plants have started sifting through the goo just yet. \n \n \u201cTechnically, it is possible to extract these metals, although it is very challenging,\u201d says Herckes. Currently, there is no technology we are aware of that can do it on a large scale without the use of enormous amounts of energy and harsh chemicals, he adds. \n \n So don\u2019t go digging out your old prospecting pan from the garage just yet. You\u2019d have better luck scouring the streets of Manhattan\u2019s Diamond District, where one urban prospector pulled in almost $1,000 in a week by collecting bits of gold and jewels off the ground. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| If the holy grail of medieval alchemists was turning lead into gold, how much more magical would it be to draw gold from, well, poop? It turns out that a ton of sludge, the goo left behind when treating sewage, could contain several hundred dollars\u2019 worth of metals\u2014potentially enough to generate millions of dollars worth of gold, silver, and other minerals each year for a city of a million people. \n \n Metals have long been known to concentrate in sewage, which mixes toilet water with effluent from industrial manufacturing, storm runoff, and anything else flushed down the drain. It\u2019s a headache for sewage utilities that must cope with toxic metals lacing wastewater headed for streams or sludge that might otherwise be spread on farm fields. \n \n But what if those metals had value? In a new study, scientists at Arizona State University (ASU), Tempe, quantified the different metals in sewage sludge and estimated what it all might be worth. They took sludge samples gathered from around the country and measured the metal content using a mass spectrometer that can discern different elements as they are ionized in a superhot plasma. The upshot: There's as much as $13 million worth of metals in the sludge produced every year by a million-person city, including $2.6 million in gold and silver, they report online this week in Environmental Science & Technology. \n \n That amount won't be rattling the world gold market, nor would it be feasible to extract every last bit. But the study\u2019s lead author, environmental engineer Paul Westerhoff, says it could prove worthwhile for cities looking for ways to gain value from something that can be a costly disposal problem. One city in Japan has already tried extracting gold from its sludge. In Suwa in Nagano Prefecture, a treatment plant near a large number of precision equipment manufacturers reportedly collected nearly 2 kilograms of gold in every metric ton of ash left from burning sludge, making it more gold-rich than the ore in many mines. \n \n Although no U.S. sewage plants have followed suit, the new study adds to a growing push to rethink sewage as a valuable commodity, says Jordan Peccia, a Yale University engineer who was not involved in the work. Approximately 8 million tons of biosolids\u2014a dried derivative of sludge\u2014are generated every year in the United States. \n \n Today, about 60% of the sewage sludge in the United States is already spread on fields and forests as fertilizer. But there are concerns it poses contamination risks from toxic chemicals and pathogens, a subject Peccia\u2019s lab studies. The remaining sludge is burned in incinerators or dumped in landfills. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get rid of this sewage sludge,\u201d Peccia says. \u201cWe need to make this push where we stop thinking about it as a liability and instead we think about it as a resource. And anything we can find in sewage sludge that\u2019s valuable, it\u2019s good.\u201d \n \n Metals aren\u2019t the only things with potential value. A small number of sewage plants are removing phosphorous and nitrogen, which can be sold as fertilizer. A Swedish treatment plant is testing the feasibility of making bioplastics from wastewater. A model sewage incinerator that generates electricity and drinking water was just promoted by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which helped fund its construction. \n \n But it could be a while before wastewater operators start prospecting for precious metals in more than an isolated case. The minerals found in the sludge were frequently dissolved or in microscopic particles. Rare earth elements were so dilute that they were present in levels similar to those in plain dirt. \n \n Precious metals such as gold could find their way into the sewers courtesy of mining, electroplating, electronics and jewelry manufacturing, or industrial and automotive catalysts. The sludge in the study came from two Arizona treatment plants and from a mixture of samples from around the country stored at ASU\u2019s U.S. National Biosolids Repository. \n \n Focusing on 13 of the most concentrated minerals with the highest value, the scientists put the haul at $280 per ton, or $8 million for that hypothetical million-person city. That included such precious metals as platinum, gold, and silver, as well as more common copper, iron, and zinc. A metric ton of sludge contained 16.7 grams of silver and about a third of a gram of gold. Even then, the practical value could be less, as the estimate was based on extracting every bit of the metals. \n \n The study doesn\u2019t spell out the potential cost of getting at these metals or the price society pays for leaving them in the sludge, such as added pollution. \"The next thing is to look at whether it\u2019s economically or technically viable,\u201d Westerhoff says. \u201cWe think it is.\u201d \n \n Cost is one of the chief barriers keeping sewage treatment plants from going for the gold, says Charles Bott, chief of research and development at the Hampton Roads Sanitation District in Virginia Beach, which serves 1.7 million people in southeastern Virginia. The district started extracting phosphorous and nitrogen from sludge at one of its plants in 2010 to comply with stricter protections for Chesapeake Bay. Mining sludge is \u201ca hot topic of conversation,\u201d Bott says. \u201cIt\u2019s just a question of getting to the point where the technology is available that makes the finances work out.\u201d",
    "reference": "\u2013 The sewage being treated by your city could be a veritable gold mine. That's because all kinds of metals end up in sewage sludge, which is the leftovers from treated sewage, Science reports. Researchers in Arizona recently found that a city of a million people could generate up to $13 million a year in such metals, with $2.6 million of that coming in the form of gold and silver. They studied the samples, which came from 32 states, with a mass spectrometer, Discover reports; the tool uses extreme heat to reveal elements. On a global scale, they found, sludge probably contains about 360 tons of gold each year. \"While we expected that the metals were present at low concentration, the fact that the small amounts represent such a significant economic value was definitely surprising,\" a study co-author tells Time. Getting at those metals might sound like a pipe dream, quite literally, but a city in Japan was able to get about four pounds of gold from every metric ton of ash from burned sludge. That's better than what some mines can offer, Science notes. \"We need to make this push where we stop thinking about (sewage sludge) as a liability and instead we think about it as a resource,\" says an outside researcher. Unfortunately, there's not currently any technology to extract metals from sludge on a large scale, but if we could someday find a way to do so, there could be environmental benefits, too: The metals in sludge, which is often used as fertilizer, may not be great for the environment, so removing them could be a good thing. As for how metals get into wastewater? Industries like electronics, jewelry manufacturing, mining, and the like. (If searching through sludge is too much for you, you could always look for gold directly in the toilet.)"

    "input": "One of the survivors of the disastrous Fyre Festival in the Bahamas has filed a $100 million class action lawsuit against co-founders Billy McFarland and Ja Rule (real name Jeffrey Atkins), accusing the duo of subjecting festivalgoers to \"dangerous conditions\" at a luxury festival that organizers allegedly knew was doomed. \n \n Related Fyre Festival Head Billy McFarland: 'We Were a Little Naive' \"We were overwhelmed and just didn't have the foresight to solve all these problems,\" organizer says. \"Next year, we will definitely start earlier\" \n \n In a legal complaint obtained by Rolling Stone, the suit claims that \"this outrageous failure to prepare, coupled with Defendants' deliberate falsehoods in promoting the island 'experience,' demonstrates that the Fyre Festival was nothing more than a get-rich-quick scam from the very beginning.\" \n \n \"Defendants intended to fleece attendees for hundreds of millions of dollars by inducing them to fly to a remote island without food, shelter or water \u2014 and without regard to what might happen to them after that,\" the suit adds. \n \n In the lawsuit, filed by lawyer Mark Geragos on behalf of attendee Daniel Jung, the many shortcomings of the festival are mapped out via eyewitness reports and social media postings, providing a tableaux of just how poorly conceived and planned the festival was. \n \n \"The festival's lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees \u2014 suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions \u2014 that was closer to The Hunger Games or Lord of the Flies than Coachella,\" the lawsuit states. \n \n \"Festival-goers survived on bare rations, little more than bread and a slice of cheese, and tried to escape the elements in the only shelter provided by Defendants: small clusters of 'FEMA tents,' exposed on a sand bar, that were soaked and battered by wind and rain.\" \n \n \n \n The dinner that @fyrefestival promised us was catered by Steven Starr is literally bread, cheese, and salad with dressing. #fyrefestival pic.twitter.com/I8d0UlSNbd \u2014 Tr3vor (@trev4president) April 28, 2017 \n \n \"We have been deluged with calls from people with horror stories,\" Geragos tells Rolling Stone. \"We will be expanding the scope of our case dramatically and we are pursuing other remedies as well.\" \n \n \n \n The lawsuit alleges fraud and breach of contract against the organizers, levying claims that McFarland and Atkins knowingly lied about the festival's promised location \u2013 it was not an island privately owned by Pablo Escobar as promised, but rather a gravelly site near a Sandals in the Bahamas strewn with garbage. \n \n Because the festival was \"cashless\" \u2013 organizers recommended attendees deposit funds into the Fyre wristband \u2013 many attendees did not have the necessary money to ensure transportation back to the Bahamas airport as the festival collapsed Friday. \n \n The lawsuit also alleges that McFarland and Ja Rule knew that the festival was troubled but proceeded anyway, putting festivalgoers in danger. \n \n \"Shockingly, Defendants had been aware for months that their festival was dangerously under-equipped and posed a serious danger to anyone in attendance,\" the lawsuit added. \n \n \"More troublingly, Mr. McFarland and Mr. Atkins began personally reaching out to performers and celebrities in advance of the festival and warned them not to attend \u2014 acknowledging the fact that the festival was outrageously underequipped and potentially dangerous for anyone in attendance.\" \n \n \"We are in the process of helping all Fyre Festival guests apply for refunds,\" a member of the festival's management team tells Rolling Stone. \"All guests who purchased tickets have been sent the appropriate form to start the refund procedure. The Fyre Festival is a dream and vision that we regrettably did not see come to life how we\u2019d imagined in 2017, but our main priority now is rectifying the situation and helping all affected guests. \n \n \"Once the refund application process is complete, we will start sharing news on plans for Fyre Festival 2018,\" he adds. \"Currently 81% of guests who have filled out the refund application have said they would like to attend Fyre Festival 2018. We are so thankful for their support and excitement as we strive to make this right.\" \n \n Speaking to Rolling Stone, McFarland acknowledged that the first-time festival organizers were \"a little naive\" and quickly became overwhelmed under the circumstances, but added that the Fyre Festival would return in 2018 at a stateside venue. \n \n \n \n \"We were overwhelmed and just didn't have the foresight to solve all these problems,\" McFarland said. \"We thought we were making timeframes that were correct. We were a little na\u00efve in thinking for the first time we could do this ourselves. Next year, we will definitely start earlier. The reality is, we weren't experienced enough to keep up.\" \n \n \n \n \"I'm heartbroken at this moment,\" Ja Rule told Rolling Stone last week. \"My partners and I wanted this to be an amazing event, it was NOT A SCAM as everyone is reporting. I don't know how everything went so left but I'm working to make it right by making sure everyone is refunded ... I truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT ... but I'm taking responsibility. I'm deeply sorry to everyone who was inconvenienced by this.\" \n \n \n \n Fyre Festival Lawsuit by mendle44 on Scribd ||||| A major lawsuit has been filed in California against Ja Rule and Billy McFarland, organizers of the Fyre Festival, the two-weekend concert in the Bahamas that was scheduled for last weekend but collapsed in disorganization before it started. The suit was filed on Sunday in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by celebrity trial lawyer Mark Geragos, who is seeking class action status. Geragos filed suit electronically on Sunday on behalf of plaintiff Daniel Jung, who is seeking $5 million in damages for alleged fraud, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and negligent misrepresentation. \n \n The suit anticipates a class of \u201cmore than 150 \u201cplaintiffs for whom it seeks a minimum of $100 million. Geragos will be busy over the upcoming week seeking out other litigants to join the suit, which alleges that the \u201cfestival\u2019s lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees \u2014 suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions \u2014 that was closer to \u2018The Hunger Games\u2019 or \u2018Lord of the Flies\u2019 than Coachella.\u201d \n \n The suit claims as its causes of action: fraud, breach of contract, breach of covenant of good faith and negligent misrepresentation and seeks a minimum of $100 million in damages. It is believed a crowd of approximately 6,000 attendees was expected to attend the festival, though it is unclear how many tickets were actually sold. \n \n Tickets to Fyre Fest cost anywhere from $1,000 to $125,000 for luxury group packages to the event, which was to have run in two parts: April 28-30 and May 5-7 on the private Fyre Cay in the Grand Bahamas Exuma Island chain. Performers were to include Blink-182, Migos, Major Lazer and Disclosure. By April 27 social media began lighting up with reports of distressed guests, arriving to find not the luxury accommodations they\u2019d signed up for, but a dirt field with flimsy tents. \n \n In the past, Geragos has represented Michael Jackson, Winona Ryder, singer Kesha and politician Gary Condit in high-profile cases. \n \n Jung claims to have spent $2,000 on his Fyre Festival ticket and airfare. For that, he and fellow \u201cfestival-goers survived on bare rations, little more than bread and a slice of cheese, and tried to escape the elements in the only shelter provided by Defendants: small clusters of \u2018FEMA tents,\u2019 exposed on a sand bar, that were soaked and battered by wind and rain.\u201d \n \n The commonwealth of Bahamas may well file a suit of its own. TMZ reported the Bahamas \u201cstands to lose out on millions with the festival being called off \u2026 and tourism officials are devastated.\u201d The Ministry of Tourism released a statement saying it is \u201cextremely disappointed.\u201d \n \n ABC News reports that the festival site is now in \u201clockdown\u201d by the island\u2019s government. \u201cPrivate security guards were seen Saturday protecting the main site where people had been slated to sleep in luxury tents,\u201d ABC reported, alleging McFarland failed to pay customs duty taxes \u201con items that he imported for the event,\u201d and that \u201che and his staff have left the items with a security company guarding it.\u201d \n \n Having removed promotional materials for the festival, the Fyre Fest official website now offers its explanation for the disastrous turn of events, claiming the organizers were overwhelmed by the response after news of the fest went viral. Finding the island couldn\u2019t support the swelling crowd, it was decided \u201cinfrastructure for a festival of this magnitude needed to be built from the ground up. So, we decided to literally attempt to build a city. We set up water and waste management, brought an ambulance from New York, and chartered 737 planes to shuttle our guests via 12 flights a day from Miami.\u201d McFarland made similar comments to Rolling Stone and in a video posted on TMZ. \n \n To say the efforts fell short is an understatement. The suit alleges that festival attendees became virtual prisoners: \u201cFaced with the complete lack of even the most basic amenities, as well as no assistance from Defendants, festival attendees began to panic. Predictably, Attendees began attempting to leave the island en masse, but found themselves trapped\u2014even locked inside an airport awaiting delayed flights.\u201d \n \n Efforts to \u201cescape,\u201d the suit claims, \u201cwere hamstrung by their reliance upon Defendants for transportation, as well as by the fact that Defendants promoted the festival as a \u2018cashless\u2019 event\u2014Defendants instructed attendees to upload funds to a wristband for use at the festival rather than bringing any cash. As such, Attendees were unable to purchase basic transportation on local taxis or busses, which accept only cash. As a result \u2026 at least one attendee suffered a medical emergency and lost consciousness after being locked inside a nearby building with other concert-goers waiting to be airlifted from the island.\u201d \n \n Given that the festivals organizers did not have the funds to compensate the entertainers booked to perform \u2014 and it is unclear as to whether they had insurance \u2014 speculation has begun that Geragos may go after some of the bigger name models who took part in promoting the ill-fated event. Celebrities \u201cincluding Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski\u201d were cited by name in the complaint, which says they used their social media accounts \u201cto generate ticket sales.\u201d The website FashionLaw.com speculates the models\u2019 participation in promoting the site may trigger a Federal Trade Commission proceeding for false advertising. \n \n Although the Fyre Fest organizers have offered to give all disappointed 2017 festival-goers free tickets to the 2018 iteration, which they said they intend to hold in the United States, it\u2019s clear that this isn\u2019t going to make the problem go away and that all involved have a long legal slog ahead. \n \n Neither Geragos, McFarland nor a representative for Ja Rule replied for requests for comment at the time this report was filed.",
    "reference": "\u2013 If organizers of the music-festival-turned-disaster known as the Fyre Festival had hoped to make a quick buck, their strategy may be backfiring in a big way. Rolling Stone reports that an attendee/survivor has filed a $100 million class-action lawsuit against festival creators Billy McFarland and rapper Ja Rule, aka Jeffrey Atkins. The complaint ticks off a by-now familiar litany of complaints about the supposedly luxurious getaway in the Bahamas that saw everything that could go wrong do so in spectacular fashion. And one big problem for McFarland and Ja Rule is that their well-heeled clientele can afford big-name lawyers. \"The festival's lack of adequate food, water, shelter, and medical care created a dangerous and panicked situation among attendees\u2014suddenly finding themselves stranded on a remote island without basic provisions\u2014that was closer to The Hunger Games or Lord of the Flies than Coachella,\" the lawsuit states. Celeb attorney Mark Geragos filed the suit on behalf of attendee Daniel Jung, who wants $5 million for alleged fraud and breach of contract, reports Variety. Geragos anticipates about 150 others will join the suit. McFarland and Ja Rule have apologized, promised refunds, and vowed to be back better than ever in 2018."

    "input": "The Gaia mission, scheduled to launch Thursday morning (Dec. 19), could be a bonanza for discovering exoplanets, perhaps finding more than 2,500 new alien worlds, scientists suggest. \n \n Gaia, a $1 billion (740 million euros) mission from the European Space Agency (ESA), aims to chart a 3D map of the Milky Way by surveying more than 1 billion stars, amounting to about 1 percent of the stars in the galaxy, using its billion-pixel camera. Its goal is to make the largest, most precise map of where Earth dwells by observing the position of each of these stars 70 times over five years. \n \n ESA will broadcast a live webcast of Gaia's launch atop a Russian Soyuz rocket from the Guiana Space Center in South America beginning at 3:30 a.m. EST (0830 GMT) on Thursday. Gaia is scheduled to launch at 4:12 a.m. EST (0912 GMT), and you can watch the Gaia webcast live on SPACE.com, courtesy of ESA. [See photos of the Gaia spacecraft] \n \n To pinpoint the position of a star in 3D \u2014 a field known as astrometry \u2014 Gaia will measure the distance of the star from the sun. The satellite will do so by watching how its position shifts over time. As the Earth orbits the sun, the apparent positions of stars change with regard to each other due to how our viewpoint has moved, a phenomenon known as parallax. \n \n Discovering a star's distance can narrow down many of its other details. For instance, the actual brightness of a star can only be determined by not only measuring how bright it appears but also how far away it lies and thus how distance might have dimmed its light. Once researchers know how bright a star actually is, they can determine how much fuel it must burn \u2014 that is, the star's mass. A star's brightness is also related to its width, and so discovering its brightness can help deduce its size. Knowing a star's mass and size then helps determine the strength of gravity on its surface. \n \n Gaia will also scan the color of stars. This can help reveal details of their chemical makeup as well as its temperature, as the color of a star depends on its surface temperature. Knowing the brightness and color of a star can also help figure out its age and thus stage in its evolution. All in all, Gaia will help shed light on the composition, formation and evolution of the stars that make up the galaxy, researchers say. \n \n Gaia will make the largest, most precise 3D map of our galaxy by surveying an unprecedented number of stars. Credit: ESA \n \n Charting the stars and planets \n \n Gaia is not the first space mission to chart the stars. In 1989, ESA launched the Hipparcos satellite, which charted the positions of more than 100,000 stars with high precision and more than 2 million stars with slightly less precision. In the end, Hipparcos measured the distances of all stars within 325 light-years and bright stars within 3,250 light-years (to within 10 percent). \n \n In comparison, Gaia will collect more than 30 times more light than Hipparcos. This will help measure a star's position 200 times more accurately. All in all, Gaia can measure the distances of stars as far away as the galactic center \u2014 roughly 32,500 light-years away \u2014 with an accuracy within 10 percent. \n \n On top of what light Gaia might shed on the stars in the Milky Way, it may also reveal exoplanets orbiting them, said astronomer Alessandro Sozzetti at the Astrophysical Observatory of Turin in Italy. This could be the first time exoplanets are detected using astrometry. [Video: Galaxy's Most Precise 3D Map: Gaia Probe Will Make It] \n \n NASA's exoplanet-hunting Kepler spacecraft discovered planets through photometry \u2014 that is, by measuring light. It looked at regular dips in starlight caused by planets crossing between stars and Earth. \n \n Gaia can hunt worlds a different way. The gravitational pull of a planet can introduce a regular wobble in its host star's position as they orbit each other that Gaia can detect over time. \n \n Gaia will be most effective at detecting giant planets orbiting small stars. These planetary systems are prone to generating significant, noticeable wobbles in a star's position. \n \n Sozzetti and his colleagues focused on red dwarfs, also known as M dwarf stars, which are relatively small, less than 60 percent the mass of the sun. These stars make up roughly three-quarters of the stars in the galaxy, and scientists recently found red dwarfs are far more common than before thought, making up at least 80 percent of the total number of stars. Moreover, past research suggests about 6.5 percent of red dwarfs host giant Jupiter-mass planets. \n \n The researchers devised computer models simulating Jupiter-mass planets around the 3,150 red dwarfs known to exist within about 110 light-years of Earth. They estimated Gaia could detect about 100 new giant planets from this sample if such worlds exist about 0.5 to 3 astronomical units around those stars. (An astronomical unit is equal to Earth's distance from the sun \u2014 about 93 million miles, or 150 million kilometers.) \n \n In addition, unlike Kepler, Gaia should be able to deduce the full orbits and masses of these giant worlds. For more than 80 percent of stars detected by Gaia around M dwarf stars within about 110 light-years of Earth, their masses could be measured to within 10 percent. \n \n Extrapolating from these findings, the researchers suggest Gaia could find about 2,600 giant planets orbiting the roughly 415,000 red dwarfs within about 325 light-years from Earth. [The Strangest Alien Planets (Photos)] \n \n Sozzetti and his colleagues detailed their findings online Nov. 11 in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society. \n \n \"Gaia should be able to detect orbital motion for giant planets orbiting hundreds of M dwarfs,\" said astronomer David Latham at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who did not take part in this study. \n \n The researchers also calculated they could accurately derive the masses and orbits of as many as 500 of these 2,600 planets. In addition, within this group of stars, Gaia might identify hints of 10 systems with planets that might possibly noticeably cross in front of their host stars. \n \n Exoplanet astrometry \n \n Astronomers have tried detecting exoplanets using astrometry before. Until now, astrometry has only helped confirm the existence of exoplanets detected through other methods, not ones astrometry spotted directly. So far astrometry has suffered about 70 years of blunders in the field of exoplanet detection, \"with many a discovery announcement biting the dust,\" Sozzetti said. \"We're finally on the verge of seeing astrometry coming of age and providing substantial contributions to this field.\" \n \n Sozzetti cautioned that Gaia is not sensitive enough to detect planets of about Earth's mass, as Kepler is. \"Its astrometric accuracy is not sufficient, not even for the nearest stars,\" he said. \n \n Gaia should also not be able to detect planets within the habitable zones of red dwarfs \u2014 that is, the areas around stars where it is warm enough on a planet's surface for water to stay liquid. Since red dwarfs are very dim, their habitable zones are typically very close to them, about 3 percent to 30 percent of an astronomical unit. The astrometric signals caused by planets get increasingly smaller the closer they are to their stars, meaning that worlds in a red dwarf's habitable zone would probably be too difficult to detect. \n \n However, Sozzetti said Gaia could provide unique insights \"on the existence of systems in which the likelihood of a potentially habitable terrestrial planet may have formed is high.\" By seeing where a giant planet is orbiting a star, Gaia can help rule out any systems where giant planets may have interfered with the formation of rocky planets within those stars' habitable zones. \n \n Sozzetti noted that Gaia and Kepler ought to be highly complementary in several ways. While Kepler can discover many small worlds, Gaia can find thousands of giant planets. \n \n \"The combination of Gaia and Kepler data will allow for a much improved understanding of planetary systems' properties and frequencies as a function of the host stars' characteristics,\" Sozzetti said. \n \n This story was provided by Astrobiology Magazine, a web-based publication sponsored by the NASA astrobiology program. \n \n Follow us @Spacedotcom, Facebook and Google+.

It should even be possible then to determine their ages. \n \n And for about 150 million of these stars, Gaia will measure their velocity either towards or away from us. \n \n This will enable scientists to use them as three-dimensional markers to trace the evolution of the Milky Way, to in essence make a time-lapse movie that can be run forwards to see what happens in the future, or run backwards to reveal how the galaxy was assembled in the past. \n \n And because Gaia will track anything that passes across its camera detector, it is likely also to see a colossal number of objects that have hitherto gone unrecorded - such as comets, asteroids, planets beyond our Solar System, cold dead stars, and even tepid stars that never quite fired into life. \n \n \"It will allow us, for the first time ever, to walk through the Milky Way - to say where everything is, to say what everything is. It is truly a transformative mission,\" said Prof Gerry Gilmore from Cambridge University, UK. \n \n By the end of the decade, the Gaia archive of processed data is expected to exceed 1 Petabyte (1 million Gigabytes), equivalent to about 200,000 DVDs of information. \n \n This store is so vast that it will keep professional astronomers busy for decades. \n \n \"To think that you see individual scientific papers coming out now that talk about just a single object - a single star or exoplanet. And very soon, because of Gaia, we will have information on a billion objects. What will the scientific literature look like then?\" pondered Dr Michael Perryman, the former Gaia Esa project scientist now affiliated to Princeton University, US. \n \n \"Of course, there will be big statistical projects you can tackle with this data, but it is clear the scale of Gaia means this information is not going to be superseded for a very long time,\" he told BBC News. \n \n As the Earth goes around the Sun, relatively nearby stars appear to move against the 'fixed' stars that are even further away \n \n Because we know the Sun-Earth distance, we can use the parallax angle to work out the distance to the target star \n \n But such angles are very small - less than one arcsecond for the nearest stars, or 0.05% of the full Moon's diameter \n \n Gaia will make repeat observations to reduce measurement errors down to seven micro-arcseconds for the very brightest stars \n \n Parallaxes are used to anchor other, more indirect techniques on the 'ladder' deployed to measure the most far-flung distances \n \n It will though offer ample scope for citizen scientists to mine Gaia's data to make their own discoveries, and a number of crowdsourcing projects to facilitate this activity will get under way next year. \n \n Gaia is the result of an enormous industrial effort led by Astrium satellites in Toulouse, France. \"For this masterpiece, for this jewel of space hardware, Astrium gathered and led an industrial consortium made up of 50 companies - 47 European, three North American,\" said CEO Eric Beranger. \n \n \"Coming to [French Guiana] and seeing our satellite lifting off brings me huge emotion.

Reed, the suspect in the murders of Monique Patenaude and Patrick Shunn of Oso, has been on the run from Snohomish County authorities since April 11, the date of the suspected murders, a sheriff\u2019s news release says. \n \n According to the U.S. Marshal\u2019s Office, deputy marshals have been working investigative leads with Mexican authorities from Policia ESTATAL Investigadora in Sonora, Mexico, to determine the location of Reed. \n \n He was discovered July 22 and expelled to the United States by Mexican authorities for violation of immigration laws. \n \n He was taken into custody at the border by U.S. officials and booked into the Pima County Jail in Arizona. \n \n It is unknown at this time when Reed might be extradited to Washington state. \n \n Jana Hecla, who owns the Oso General Store, said Friday that it was fitting Reed was caught today, the same day Shunn and Patenaude were laid to rest in Oregon. \n \n \u201cIt was a blessing for their family and friends to get some closure,\u201d she said. \n \n Hecla said anyone who knew Reed had to be surprised. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be taken alive,\u201d she said. \n \n Hecla said she was impressed with the persistence of law enforcement. It took on the community\u2019s mantra that, \u201cYou will pay for this.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a resounding relief that he is detained, and he is going to be held accountable,\u201d she said. \n \n Hecla said she normally doesn\u2019t have the characteristic of being a vigilante, but you never know \u201cuntil it happens close to home.\u201d \n \n \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t live in fear of your neighbors,\u201d she said. \u201cOur hearts are still broken.\u201d \n \n Tony Reed, John\u2019s brother, was on the run, too, until he surrendered to U.S. authorities May 16, while in Mexico. \n \n After surrendering, his charges were reduced from first-degree murder. He has subsequently pled guilty to two counts of rendering criminal assistance for his part in helping John dispose of Patenaude's and Shunn\u2019s bodies. \n \n Reed's parents, 81-year-old Clyde and 77-year-old Faye, were taken arrested on the same charge. Both reportedly admitted they provided a vehicle to John and Tony to flee the area. They also admitted to transferring the title from John's truck, believed to have been used in the murders, to Faye. They also admitted to having provided financial assistance to their sons. \n \n The Marshals Service was offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to Reed\u2019s capture and arrest. Two charges of first-degree homicide have been filed against Reed for the execution-style murders of 45-year-old Shunn and his wife, 46-year-old Patenaude. \n \n Tony helped detectives locate the gravesite of Shunn and Patanaude, who were both shot to death. \n \n Timeline of investigation \n \n April 12 - Patrick Shunn and Monique Patenaude are reported missing to the sheriff's office by neighbors. Shunn was last seen at his workplace in Kirkland April 11. Patenaude was last seen around 1 p.m., also on April 11 near the couple's residence at the 27800 block of Whitman Road. \n \n April 14 - Two vehicles belonging to Shunn and Patenaude are located in a remote, wooded area in the Oso area. \n \n April 15 \u2013 Detectives conduct a search of the vehicles and the area where they were located. \n \n April 17 \u2013 Sheriff Ty Trenary announces that probable cause had been established for the arrest of the Reed brothers, who were suspected of murdering Shunn and Patenaude. \n \n April 18 \u2013 One of the vehicles driven by the Reed brothers is located in Phoenix, Ariz. The Reed brothers are believed to have crossed the border into Mexico driving a 2002 Gold Acura 3.2 TL (Arizona plate BNN-9968). \n \n April 20 \u2013 Several properties in Ellensburg are searched by detectives, including the residence belonging to the parents of the Reed brothers, two storage units and the residence of Tony Reed. \n \n May 16 \u2013 Tony Reed is taken into custody at the U.S./Mexico border and booked into the San Diego County Jail. \n \n May 20-21 \u2013 Tony Reed is transported and booked into the Snohomish County Jail in Everett. \n \n May 24 \u2013 Two bodies are found in an area a few miles to the west of where Shunn and Patenaude's vehicles were located. \n \n May 26 \u2013 The Snohomish County Medical Examiner identifies the bodies. The cause of death for Patenaude was multiple gunshot wounds and for Shunn was a gunshot wound of the head. \n \n May 27 \u2013 Sheriff's office distributes \"Wanted\" posters in the Tijuana, Ensenada and Rosarita areas of Mexico for the capture and arrest of John Reed. \n \n June 14 \u2013 Reed's parents are arrested and charges reduced for Tony Reed. \n \n July 22 \u2013 John Reed is captured in Mexico and turned over to U.S. authorities. He is now in the Pima County Jail. ||||| Newly released court records outline long-running hostilities between neighbors that may have led to the disappearances of an Arlington couple now presumed slain, and two brothers who are being sought as suspects. \n \n A former neighbor now wanted in the presumed slayings of a missing Arlington couple previously threatened to shoot the husband and wife for cutting brush between their two properties, newly released court records show. \n \n John Blaine Reed, 53, who shared a common driveway with Patrick Shunn and his wife, Monique Patenaude, \u201creportedly stated he would shoot or assault them if they didn\u2019t leave\u201d him alone, investigators wrote in an affidavit for a search warrant. \n \n Reed\u2019s alleged threat, which Shunn later reported in 2013 to Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s deputies, was just part of an \u201congoing and constant\u201d dispute between the couple and Reed, whom investigators describe in records as a disgruntled landowner angered by the response to the deadly landslide near Oso that left 43 people dead in 2014. \n \n The couple had filed a lawsuit two years ago over alleged threats and harassment by other neighbors, but that suit didn\u2019t name Reed as a defendant. Shunn and Patenaude avoided naming Reed because they didn\u2019t want to irk him, the couple\u2019s former lawyer said Monday. \n \n But in recent weeks, Reed apparently became angry with the couple after Patenaude complained to a county official that Reed had been illegally squatting on his former property, which he recently had sold to the county, the records say. \n \n The new details about the case, contained in 73 pages of detectives\u2019 search-warrant records released Monday, shed new light on why investigators are now searching for Reed and his younger brother, Tony C. Reed, 49, in connection with the couple\u2019s presumed homicides. \n \n Both men remained at large Monday, while investigators continued searching the remote woods near Oso for the couple\u2019s bodies near the area where their vehicles were found last week. \n \n The couple\u2019s disappearance came about two weeks after Reed sold his condemned property to Snohomish County as part of a buyout for landowners affected by the deadly slide. \n \n Some time after the county took over the property on March 31, Patenaude complained to a county parks official that Reed still was \u201csquatting\u201d in his former home, the records say. \n \n Based on her complaint, Snohomish County \u201ctrespassed\u201d Reed from the former property \u2014 an action that made him \u201cvery unhappy,\u201d a county official recently recalled to detectives investigating the case. \n \n The records released Monday also detail a string of physical evidence and witness statements that may tie the brothers to the couple\u2019s disappearance. \n \n Michael and Suzanne Loo, friends and neighbors of the couple, reported them missing a week ago after finding the couple\u2019s dog running loose and their livestock untended, but no sign of Shunn and Patenaude or their vehicles at their home. \n \n After reporting them missing April 12, Suzanne Loo later saw the Reed brothers that day trying to access John Reed\u2019s former property, the records say. Reed allegedly told Loo they were there to move personal items; the brothers were traveling in Reed\u2019s \u201cred, lifted pickup truck,\u201d Loo later told investigators. \n \n Related video: John Reed describes Oso landslide John Reed was in the front yard of his house on the north side of the Stillaguamish River on March 22, 2014 during the Oso landslide. John Reed was in the front yard of his house on the north side of the Stillaguamish River on March 22, 2014 during the Oso landslide. Read more . (Marcus Yam / The Seattle Times) \n \n On Thursday, a search-and-rescue helicopter team spotted the couple\u2019s extensively damaged vehicles next to a clear-cut area north of the couple\u2019s 20-acre farm along the Stillaguamish River. The vehicles, a Land Rover and Jeep Wrangler, had been pushed or driven over an embankment and partly concealed by cut branches. The Land Rover apparently became stuck on the edge of the embankment, a mound, and appeared to have been \u201cpried\u201d over it with a digging tool or lever, records say. \n \n At the top of the embankment, investigators also found a new tarp spread out over a mound covered with cut branches and debris, the affidavit states. \n \n Near the vehicles, investigators later recovered an Ace Hardware bag, an ax, rubber gloves, tarps, posts and other items, records say. Detectives traced the items to a hardware store in Arlington, whose owner recalled John Reed as a frequent customer who he\u2019d seen at the store April 13. \n \n Armed with a warrant, detectives searched Reed\u2019s property Saturday, finding \u201cred stains, which appeared to be dried blood,\u201d in and around the bathtub and a pair of coveralls with apparent blood stains. They also found two rifles and ammunition, and gloves, a tarp and posts similar to those recovered near the couple\u2019s vehicles, the records say. \n \n Investigators also obtained video from a property owner\u2019s security camera along a road heading toward where the vehicles were found. It captured a Jeep and a Land Rover being driven up the road at 3:31 a.m. on April 12 \u2014 hours after Shunn and Patenaude were last seen, records say. \n \n About six hours later, the camera also recorded a red Toyota pickup with a winch on the front headed up the road with what may have been a post in the back, the records say. \n \n Based on the evidence, Snohomish County Sheriff Ty Trenary announced Sunday investigators believe the couple are dead and named the Reed brothers as suspects in their slayings. \n \n The brothers are both felons who are considered armed and dangerous, the sheriff said. \n \n John Reed\u2019s red Toyota pickup was recovered Saturday in the garage of his parents\u2019 Ellensburg home, the records show. The truck\u2019s ownership registration had been transferred to the name of Reed\u2019s mother one day earlier, the records say. \n \n The brothers now may be driving their parents\u2019 red 2007 Volkswagen EOS coupe with Washington plates AXH5106. \n \n Two months after the deadly landslide in 2014, John Reed shared his experiences of witnessing and surviving the catastrophe with The Seattle Times. \n \n He said then he knew the rugged terrain around Oso extensively. He also noted he was drawn to his lot by the privacy he enjoyed at the end of the road, and noted he had no plans to move off his land, where he had lived for 18 years. \n \n But the disaster apparently took an emotional toll. \n \n After the mudslide, deputies took a report that Reed had threatened FEMA workers at the Oso Fire Hall \u201cin regard to his displeasure about the landslide and associated response.\u201d \n \n The deputies were told \u201cReed made a loud comment about driving his truck through the building and taking everyone out with him,\u201d the warrant records say. \n \n Reed later explained he was very upset that his slide-damaged driveway hadn\u2019t been fixed, saying he feared if he didn\u2019t get money to fix it, his property would be condemned. \n \n A day after Shunn and Patenaude were reported missing, former deputy Bruce Cheek, who lives on the same road as the missing couple, contacted a detective to describe an incident involving John Reed shortly after the 2014 slide. \n \n \u201cCheek stated Reed was expressing extreme anger about the slide and named a list of people whom Reed blamed (Cheek did not remember the names),\u201d the records state. \u201cCheek stated Reed expressed in a serious tone that he was capable of killing people without any problems, he could shoot them and then `they\u2019 would never be able to locate the bodies as he (Reed) would get rid of them in the area of timber above the slide area.\u201d ||||| John Reed is accused of killing an Arlington couple in April. Police believe he fled to Mexico shortly thereafter. \n \n John B. Reed, suspected of killing an Arlington couple in April, has been captured in Mexico. \n \n Reed, 53, was captured by Mexican authorities on Friday, according to the Snohomish County Sheriff\u2019s Office. \n \n Authorities from the Policia Estatal Investigadora located Reed in Sonora, Mexico, and expelled him from the country for violation of Mexican immigration laws, the sheriff\u2019s office said. He was taken into custody at the border by the U.S. Marshals Service and booked into Pima County Jail in Arizona. \n \n It was not immediately known when Reed would be extradited to Washington. \n \n Police say Reed fled to Mexico after killing his former neighbors Patrick Shunn, 45, and his wife, Monique Patenaude, 46, in April. He is charged with two counts of first-degree murder. Reed reportedly had a property dispute with the couple and had threatened them, investigators say. \n \n Reed\u2019s brother, Tony Reed, and their parents have been charged with helping John Reed. \n \n Tony Reed pleaded guilty in June to two counts of rendering criminal assistance. Parents Clyde Reed, 81, and Faye Reed, 77, have each been charged with one count of rendering criminal assistance. \n \n According to prosecutors, John Reed shot Patenaude three times after she returned home from running errands in Arlington during the late-morning hours of April 11. Shunn was fatally shot once in the midafternoon of the same day when he returned home from work, charging documents say. \n \n Reed drove that evening to Ellensburg, where his parents and brother live. He stayed there for an hour and returned with Tony Reed, arriving back at the slain couple\u2019s property around midnight, according to the charges. \n \n Tony Reed, 49, later told detectives he saw Patenaude\u2019s body in her Jeep while Shunn\u2019s body was inside his Land Rover, according to the documents. \n \n The brothers waited until 3 a.m. April 12 to each drive a vehicle up North Brooks Creek Road, where they buried the bodies and then dumped the Jeep and Land Rover over a steep embankment several miles from the burial site, the papers say. \n \n The brothers walked back to John Reed\u2019s old property and, over the next two days, allegedly tried to conceal and destroy evidence of the killings. \n \n John and Tony Reed arrived back in Ellensburg no later than April 14, when John Reed attempted to cash a $96,595 cashier\u2019s check \u2014 money paid to him for his property after the Oso landslide. \n \n But the bank wouldn\u2019t cash such a large check, so Reed had the payment split into five separate checks. Reed had two checks for $14,000 each made payable to his parents, and a $40,000 check made payable to him. He signed that larger check over to his father. \n \n Reed\u2019s father was seen on a surveillance video with his son at the bank during the transaction. \n \n On April 15, Reed and his mother went to the state Department of Licensing office in Ellensburg, where he transferred the title of his red pickup to her. \n \n She later \u201cgifted\u201d her son her vehicle, which he and his brother drove to Arizona, leaving it behind before they crossed into Mexico. \n \n Clyde and Faye Reed deposited three checks totaling $68,000 into their bank accounts, only to learn Snohomish County sheriff\u2019s detectives had frozen the money so it couldn\u2019t be accessed, authorities say. \n \n Shunn and Patenaude\u2019s bodies were discovered in May after Tony Reed surrendered to authorities and led investigators to their graves. \n \n Also Friday, relatives of the couple hosted a memorial for Patenaude and Shunn at Willamette National Cemetery outside Portland. Shunn was in the military, according to the event\u2019s Facebook page, so the afternoon gathering began as a military-style funeral. After that, a pastor conducted a service, the page says. \n \n \u201cThey were always together, cremated together, and we want to keep it that way for the memorial to finally put them to rest,\u201d the page says. \n \n Responding to news of Friday\u2019s arrest, Shunn\u2019s brother, Erik Shunn, posted on Facebook: \u201cWhat a gift on the day of Pat and Monique\u2019s memorial.\u201d",

Reed was captured on the same day a memorial was held for Patrick Shunn, 45, and his wife, 46-year-old Monique Patenaude. \u201cIt was a blessing for their family and friends to get some closure,\u201d neighbor Jana Hecla tells the Marysville Globe. The US Marshals had been working with Mexican authorities in Sonora to locate Reed. \u201cWe didn\u2019t think he\u2019d be taken alive,\u201d Hecla says. According to reports, Reed allegedly shot and killed Patenaude on the morning of April 11, and then shot and killed Shunn later in the day. Reed's brother, Tony Reed, allegedly helped dispose of the bodies and the couple's vehicles. Tony Reed, who turned himself in last month after also fleeing to Mexico, has pleaded guilty to rendering criminal assistance, according to the AP. The brothers' elderly parents also face charges connected to allegedly helping their sons flee the country. According to the AP, Shunn and Patenaude lived on a 21-acre property near the rural community of Oso, where a landslide destroyed dozens of houses and killed 43 people in 2014. They shared a driveway with Reed, who at one time threatened to shoot the couple, per an earlier Seattle Times report. In the weeks before the killings, Patenaude reportedly complained to the county that Reed was squatting on the land he had recently sold to the county."

This talk will discuss exactly how, detailing the flow of national security incident response in the United States using the scenario of a major attack on the finance sector. The response starts at individual banks and exchanges, through the public-private sector information sharing processes (like FS-ISAC). Treasury handles the financial side of the crisis while DHS tackles the technical.

Working PoCs for major Android device vendors will be made available to coincide with the presentation. \n \n Presented by Jeff Forristal \n \n BinaryPig - Scalable Malware Analytics in Hadoop Over the past 2.5 years Endgame received 20M samples of malware equating to roughly 9.5 TB of binary data. In this, we\u2019re not alone. McAfee reports that it currently receives roughly 100,000 malware samples per day and received roughly 10M samples in the last quarter of 2012 [1]. Its total corpus is estimated to be about 100M samples. VirusTotal receives between 300k and 600k unique files per day, and of those roughly one-third to half are positively identified as malware [2]. This huge volume of malware offers both challenges and opportunities for security research especially applied machine learning. Endgame performs static analysis on malware in order to extract feature sets used for performing large-scale machine learning. Since malware research has traditionally been the domain of reverse engineers, most existing malware analysis tools were designed to process single binaries or multiple binaries on a single computer and are unprepared to confront terabytes of malware simultaneously. There is no easy way for security researchers to apply static analysis techniques at scale; companies and individuals that want to pursue this path are forced to create their own solutions. Our early attempts to process this data did not scale well with the increasing flood of samples. As the size of our malware collection increased, the system became unwieldy and hard to manage, especially in the face of hardware failures. Over the past two years we refined this system into a dedicated framework based on Hadoop so that our large-scale studies are easier to perform and are more repeatable over an expanding dataset. To address this problem, we will present our open framework, BinaryPig, as well as some example uses of this technology to perform a multiyear, multi-terabyte, multimillion-sample malware census. This framework is built over Apache Hadoop, Apache Pig, and Python. It addresses many issues of scalable malware processing, including dealing with increasingly large data sizes, improving workflow development speed, and enabling parallel processing of binary files with most pre-existing tools. It is also modular and extensible, in the hope that it will aid security researchers and academics in handling ever-larger amounts of malware. In addition, we will demonstrate the results of our exploration and the techniques used to derive these results. The framework, analysis modules, and some example applications will be released as open source (Apache 2.0 License) at Blackhat. http://www.darkreading.com/identityandaccessmanagement/167901114/security/attacksbrea ches/240006702/mcafeecloseto100knewmalwaresamplesperdayinq2.html https://www.virustotal.com/en/statistics/ as of 4/9/2013 \n \n BIOS Security In 2011 the National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) released a draft of special publication 800-155. This document provides a more detailed description than the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) PC client specification for content that should be measured in the BIOS to provide an adequate Static Root of Trust for Measurement (SRTM). To justify the importance of 800-155, in this talk we look at the implementation of the SRTM from a vendor's pre-800-155 laptop. We discuss how the BIOS and thus SRTM can be manipulated either due to a configuration that does not enable signed BIOS updates, or via an exploit we discovered that allows for BIOS reflash even in the presence of a signed update requirement. We also show how a 51 byte patch to the SRTM can cause it to provide a forged measurement to the TPM indicating that the BIOS is pristine. If a TPM Quote is used to query the boot state of the system, this TPM-signed falsification will then serve as the root of misplaced trust. We also show how reflashing the BIOS may not necessarily remove this trust-subverting malware. To fix the un-trustworthy SRTM we apply an academic technique whereby the BIOS software indicates its integrity through a timing side-channel. \n \n Black-Box Assessment of Pseudorandom Algorithms Last year at Black Hat, Argyros and Kiayias devastated all things pseudorandom in open-source PHP applications. This year, we're bringing PRNG attacks to the masses. We'll point out flaws in many of the most common non-cryptographic pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs) and examine how to identify a PRNG based on a black-box analysis of application output. In many cases, most or all of the PRNG's internal state can be recovered, enabling determination of past output and prediction of future output. We'll present algorithms that run many orders of magnitude faster than a brute-force search, including reversing and seeking the PRNG stream in constant time. Finally, of course, we'll demonstrate everything and give away our tool so that you can perform the attacks during your own assessments. \n \n BlackBerryOS 10 from a security perspective BlackBerry prides itself with being a strong contender in the field of secure mobile platforms. While traditionally BlackBerryOS was based on a proprietary RTOS with a JVM propped on top, the architecture was completely overhauled with BlackBerryOS 10. Now the base operating system is the formerly off-the-shelf RTOS QNX, which doesn't exactly have an excellent security track record. Moreover, for the first time in BBOS history, native code applications are allowed on the platform. This talk will present an analysis of the attack surface of BBOS 10, considering both ways to escalate privileges locally and routes for remote entry. Moreover, since exploitation is only half the work of offense, we'll show ways for rootkits to persist on the device. Last but not least we will settle whether BlackBerry Balance really holds what it promises: are mobile devices really ready to securely separate crucial business data from Angry Birds? \n \n Presented by Ralf-Philipp Weinmann \n \n Bluetooth Smart: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly, and The Fix! Bluetooth Smart, AKA Bluetooth Low Energy (BTLE), is a new modulation mode and link-layer packet format defined in Bluetooth 4.0. A new class of low-power devices and high-end smartphones are already on the market using this protocol. Applications include everything from fitness devices to wireless door locks. The Good: Bluetooth Smart is well-designed and good at what it does. We explain its workings from the PHY layer (raw RF) all the way to the application layer. The Bad: Bluetooth Smart's key exchange is weak. We will perform a live demonstration of sniffing and recovering encryption keys using open source tools we developed. The Ugly: A passive eavesdropper can decrypt all communications with a sniffed encryption key using our tools. The Fix: We implement Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman to exchange a key in-band. This backward-compatible fix renders the protocol secure against passive eavesdroppers. \n \n Presented by Mike Ryan \n \n Bochspwn: Identifying 0-days via System-wide Memory Access Pattern Analysis Throughout the last two decades, the field of automated vulnerability discovery has evolved into the advanced state we have today: effective dynamic analysis is achieved with a plethora of complex, privately developed fuzzers dedicated to specific products, file formats or protocols, with source code and binary-level static analysis slowly catching up, yet already proving useful in specific scenarios. Due to market demand and general ease of access, the efforts have been primarily focused around client software, effectively limiting kernel code coverage to a few generic syscall and IOCTL fuzzers. Considering the current impact of ring-0 security on the overall system security posture and number of kernel-specific bug classes, we would like to propose a novel, dynamic approach to locating subtle kernel security flaws that would likely otherwise remain unnoticed for years. The presentation will introduce the concept of identifying vulnerabilities in operating systems\u2019 kernels by employing dynamic CPU-level instrumentation over a live system session, on the example of using memory access patterns to extract information about potential race conditions in interacting with user-mode memory. We will discuss several different ways to implement the idea, with special emphasis on the \u201cBochspwn\u201d project we developed last year and successfully used to discover around 50 local elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in the Windows kernel so far, with many of them already addressed in the ms13-016, ms13-017, ms13-031 and ms13-036 security bulletins. The tool itself will be open-sourced during the conference, thus allowing a wider audience to test and further develop the approach. \n \n Bugalyze.com - Detecting Bugs Using Decompilation and Data Flow Analysis Bugwise is a free online web service at www.bugalyze.com to perform static analysis of binary executables to detect software bugs and vulnerabilities. It detects bugs using a combination of decompilation to recover high level information, and data flow analysis to discover issues such as use-after-frees and double frees. Bugwise has been developed over the past several years and is implemented as a series of modules in a greater system that performs other binary analysis tasks such as malware detection. This entire system consists of more than 100,000 lines of C++ code and a scalable load balanced multi-node Amazon EC2 cluster. In this talk, I will explain how Bugwise works. The system is still in the development stage but has successfully found a number of real bugs and vulnerabilities in Debian Linux. This includes double free, use-after-free, and over 50 getenv(,strcpy) bugs statically found from scanning the entire Debian repository. \n \n Presented by Silvio Cesare \n \n Buying into the Bias: Why Vulnerability Statistics Suck Academic researchers, journalists, security vendors, software vendors, and other enterprising... uh... enterprises often analyze vulnerability statistics using large repositories of vulnerability data, such as CVE, OSVDB, and others. These stats are claimed to demonstrate trends in disclosure, such as the number or type of vulnerabilities, or their relative severity. Worse, they are often (mis)used to compare competing products to assess which one offers the best security. Most of these statistical analyses are faulty or just pure hogwash. They use the easily-available, but drastically misunderstood data to craft irrelevant questions based on wild assumptions, while never figuring out (or even asking us about) the limitations of the data. This leads to a wide variety of bias that typically goes unchallenged, that ultimately forms statistics that make headlines and, far worse, are used for budget and spending. As maintainers of two well-known vulnerability information repositories, we're sick of hearing about sloppy research after it's been released, and we're not going to take it any more. We will give concrete examples of the misuses and abuses of vulnerability statistics over the years, revealing which studies do it right (rather, the least wrong), and how to judge future claims so that you can make better decisions based on these \"studies.\" We will cover all the kinds of documented and undocumented bias that can exist in a vulnerability data source; how variations in counting hurt comparative analyses; and all the ways that vulnerability information is observed, cataloged, and annotated. Steve will provide vendor-neutral, friendly, supportive suggestions to the industry. Jericho will do no such thing. \n \n Combating the Insider Threat at the FBI: Real World Lessons Learned What do T.S. Eliot, Puxatony Phil, eugenics, DLP, crowdsourcing, black swans, and narcissism have in common? They are all key concepts for an effective insider threat program. Come hear how the FBI uses a surprising variety of methods to combat insiders. In this session the FBI will provide five key lessons learned about effective detection and deterrence techniques used in the FBI's insider threat program developed over the last decade. The talk will provide insight on how our nation's premier law enforcement agency is detecting and deterring insider threat using a variety of techniques and technologies. This session will provide unique lessons learned from building a real world, operational insider threat monitoring and response program. \n \n Presented by Patrick Reidy \n \n Compromising Industrial Facilities From 40 Miles Away The evolution of wireless technologies has allowed industrial automation and control systems (IACS) to become strategic assets for companies that rely on processing plants and facilities in industries such as energy production, oil, gas, water, utilities, refining, and petrochemical distribution and processing. Effective wireless sensor networks have enabled these companies to reduce implementation, maintenance, and equipment costs and enhance personal safety by enabling new topologies for remote monitoring and administration in hazardous locations. However, the manner in which sensor networks handle and control cryptographic keys is very different from the way in which they are handled in traditional business networks. Sensor networks involve large numbers of sensor nodes with limited hardware capabilities, so the distribution and revocation of keys is not a trivial task. In this presentation, we review the most commonly implemented key distribution schemes, their weaknesses, and how vendors can more effectively align their designs with key distribution solutions. We also demonstrate some attacks that exploit key distribution vulnerabilities, which we recently discovered in every wireless device developed over the past few years by three leading industrial wireless automation solution providers. These devices are widely used by many energy, oil, water, nuclear, natural gas, and refined petroleum companies. An untrusted user or group within a 40-mile range could read from and inject data into these devices using radio frequency (RF) transceivers. A remotely and wirelessly exploitable memory corruption bug could disable all the sensor nodes and forever shut down an entire facility. When sensors and transmitters are attacked, remote sensor measurements on which critical decisions are made can be modified. This can lead to unexpected, harmful, and dangerous consequences. \n \n CreepyDOL: Cheap, Distributed Stalking Are you a person with a few hundred dollars and an insatiable curiosity about your neighbors, who is fed up with the hard work of tracking your target's every move in person? Good news! You, too, can learn the intimate secrets and continuous physical location of an entire city from the comfort of your desk! CreepyDOL is a distributed sensing and data mining system combining very-low-cost sensors, open-source software, and a focus on user experience to provide personnel identification, tracking, and analysis without sending any data to the targets. In other words, it takes you from hand-crafted, artisan skeeviness to big-box commodity creepiness, and enables government-level total awareness for about $500 of off-the-shelf hardware. \n \n Presented by Brendan O'Connor \n \n Defending Networks with Incomplete Information: A Machine Learning Approach Let's face it: we may win some battles, but we are losing the war pretty badly. Regardless of the advances in malware and targeted attacks detection technologies, our top security practitioners can only do so much in a 24-hour day; even less, if you let them eat and sleep. On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of capable people to do \"simple\" security monitoring effectively, let alone complex incident detection and response. Enter the use of Machine Learning as a way to automatically prioritize and classify potential events and attacks as something could potentially be blocked automatically, is clearly benign, or is really worth the time of your analyst. On this presentation we will present publicly for the first time an actual implementation of those concepts, in the form of a free-to-use web service. It leverages OSINT and knowledge about the spatial distribution of the Internet to generate a fluid and constantly updated classifier that pinpoints areas of interest on submitted network traffic logs. \n \n Presented by Alexandre Pinto \n \n Dissecting CSRF Attacks & Countermeasures Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) remains a significant threat to web apps and user data. Current countermeasures like request nonces can be cumbersome to deploy correctly and difficult to apply to a site retroactively. Detecting these vulns with automated tools can be equally difficult to do accurately. The presentation starts with a demonstration of how to model attacks to validate whether different kinds of countermeasures are implemented correctly. It includes a tool and code to show how to detect these vulns with few false positives. Then we explore how CSRF could be prevented at the HTTP layer by proposing a new header-based policy, similar to the intent of Content Security Policy. This new policy introduces a concept called Storage Origin Security (SOS) for cookies and session objects that foils many kinds of CSRF attacks without burdening the site with HTML modifications. The solution focuses on simplicity to make it easier to retrofit on current apps, but requires browsers to support a new client-side security control. We show how this trade-off could be a quicker way to improving security on the web. \n \n End-to-End Analysis of a Domain Generating Algorithm Malware Family Select malware families have used Domain Generating Algorithms (DGAs) over the past few years in an effort to evade traditional domain blacklists, allow for fast-flux domain registration and usage, and evade analysts\u2019 abilities to predict attackers\u2019 control servers. While novel work has been done by both private industry and academia with respect to detecting DGA-related network traffic, this presentation demonstrates end-to-end analysis of a DGA malware family, from binary deobfuscation to DGA analysis, to sinkholing, to domain registrant research, to attribution of the malware\u2019s author and accomplices. The malware family discussed in this presentation has thousands of active variants currently running on the Internet and has managed to stay off of the radar of all antivirus firms. This presentation will bring to light how this malware is tied to an underground campaign that has been active for at least the past six years. \n \n Presented by Jason Geffner \n \n Energy Fraud and Orchestrated Blackouts: Issues with Wireless Metering Protocols (wM-Bus) Government requirements, new business cases, and consumer behavioral changes drive energy market players to improve the overall management of energy infrastructures. While the energy infrastructure is steadily maintained and improved, some significant changes have been introduced to the power grids of late. Actually, the significance of the changes could be compared to the early days of the Internet where computers started to become largely interconnected. Naturally, questions arise whether a grid composed of so many interacting components can still meet today's requirements for reliability, availability, and privacy. Nations absolutely recognize the criticality of the energy infrastructure for their economic and political stability. Therefore, various initiatives to ensure reliability and availability of their energy infrastructures are being driven at nation as well as at nation union levels. In order to contribute to the evaluation of national cyber security risks, the author decided to conduct a security analysis in the field of smart energy. Utilities have started to introduce new field device technology - smart meters. As the name implies, smart meters do support many more use cases than any old conventional electricity meter did. Not only does the new generation of meters support fine granular remote data reading, but it also facilitates remote load control or remote software updates. Hence, to build a secure advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), communication protocols must support bi-directional data transmission and protect meter data and control commands in transit. Therefore, analysis of smart metering protocols is of great interest. The work presented has analyzed the security of the Meter Bus (M-Bus) as specified within the relevant standards. The M-Bus is very popular in remote meter reading and has its roots in the heat metering industries. It has continuously been adopted to fit more complex applications during the past twenty years. According to a workshop note, an estimated 15 million devices were relying on the wireless version of M-Bus in 2010. It was analyzed whether smart meters using wireless M-Bus do fit the overall security and reliability needs of the grid or whether such devices might threaten the infrastructure. The M-Bus standard has been analyzed whether it provides effective security mechanisms. It can be stated that wireless M-Bus seems to be robust against deduction of consumption behaviour from the wireless network traffic. For this reason, it is considered privacy-preserving against network traffic analysis. Unfortunately, vulnerabilities have been identified that render that fact obsolete. The findings are mainly related to confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. Consequently, smart meters relying on wireless M-Bus and supporting remote disconnects are prone to become subject to an orchestrated remote disconnect which poses a severe risk to the grid. Further issues may lead to zero consumption detection, disclosure of consumption values, and disclosure of encryption keys. Following that, the availability and reliability of the smart grid or at least parts of it may not be guaranteed. \n \n Presented by Cyrill Brunschwiler \n \n Exploiting Network Surveillance Cameras Like a Hollywood Hacker This talk will examine 0-day vulnerabilities that can be trivially exploited by remote attackers to gain administrative and root-level access to consumer and enterprise network surveillance cameras manufactured by D-Link, Trendnet, Cisco, IQInvision, Alinking and 3SVision. Thousands of these cameras are Internet accessible, and known to be deployed in homes, businesses, hotels, casinos, banks and prisons, as well as military and industrial facilities. Additionally, a proof-of-concept attack will be demonstrated in which a remote attacker can leverage the described vulnerabilities to freeze and modify legitimate video streams from these cameras, in true Hollywood fashion. \n \n Presented by Craig Heffner \n \n Evading deep inspection for fun and shell Whether you have a Next Generation Firewall, an IPS, IDS, or a BDS, the security provided by these devices depends on their capability to perform robust TCP/IP reassembly. If this fails, the device can be bypassed. We researched the TCP/IP reassembly capabilities of security boxes and found that their detection can be evaded or pierced through with evasions that apply to the IP & TCP layers. The TCP reassembly capabilities of most security boxes are still poor. Instead of doing proper TCP reassembly, many of the analyzed boxes try to prevent attacks by anomaly detection, for example, by blocking small TCP segments. However, blocking small segments leads to false positives, so this kind of blocking strategy cannot be applied to real traffic without the false positive risk. We also found evasions that allowed the attack to succeed without any logs in the security box, even if all signatures were set to block. \n \n The Factoring Dead: Preparing for the Cryptopocalypse The last several years has seen an explosion of practical exploitation of widespread cryptographic weaknesses, such as BEAST, CRIME, Lucky 13 and the RC4 bias vulnerabilities. The invention of these techniques requires a lot of hard work, deep knowledge and the ability to generate a pithy acronym, but rarely involves the use of a completely unknown weakness. Cryptography researchers have known about the existence of compression oracles, RC4 biases and problems with CBC mode for years, but the general information security community has been unaware of these dangers until fully working exploits were demonstrated. In this talk, the speakers will explain the latest breakthroughs in the academic crypto community and look ahead at what practical issues could arise for popular cryptosystems. Specifically, we will focus on the latest breakthroughs in discrete mathematics and their potential ability to undermine our trust in the most basic asymmetric primitives, including RSA. We will explain the basic theories behind RSA and the state-of-the-art in large numbering factoring, and how several recent papers may point the way to massive improvements in this area. The talk will then switch to the practical aspects of the doomsday scenario, and will answer the question \"What happens the day after RSA is broken?\" We will point out the many obvious and hidden uses of RSA and related algorithms and outline how software engineers and security teams can operate in a post-RSA world. We will also discuss the results of our survey of popular products and software, and point out the ways in which individuals can prepare for the zombi^H^H^H crypto apocalypse. \n \n Fact and Fiction: Defending your Medical Devices In the past 18 months we have seen a dramatic increase in research and presentations on the security of medical devices. While this brought much needed attention to the issue, it has also uncovered a great deal of misinformation. This talk is going to tackle those confusing and controversial topics. What\u2019s the reality of patching a medical device? Is it safe to run anti-virus protection on them? You\u2019ll find out in this talk. This presentation will outline a framework on how vendors, buyers, and administrators of medical devices can bring substantive changes in the security of these devices. This talk will also have the unique element of discussing a medical device software bug that InGuardians uncovered. This bug will be discussed in detail and replicated live on stage. InGuardians has worked closely with the FDA on properly documenting and submitting this through their tracking system. This will be covered in full detail so other researchers will know how to properly disclose bugs and vulnerabilities. \n \n Presented by Jay Radcliffe \n \n Fully Arbitrary 802.3 Packet Injection: Maximizing the Ethernet Attack Surface It is generally assumed that crafting arbitrary, and sniffing, Fast Ethernet packets can be performed with standard Network Interface Cards (NIC) and generally available packet injection software. However, full control of frame values such as the Frame Check Sequence (FCS) or Start-of-Frame delimiter (SFD) have historically required the use of dedicated and costly hardware. Our presentation will dissect Fast Ethernet layer 1 & 2 presenting novel attack techniques supported by an affordable hardware setup with customized firmware which will be publicly released. This research expands the ability to test and analyse the full attack surface of networked embedded systems, with particular attention on automation, automotive and avionics industries. Application of attacks against NICs with hard and soft Media Access Control (MAC) on industrial embedded systems will be explored. We will illustrate how specific frame manipulations can trigger SFD parsing anomalies and Ethernet Packet-In-Packet injection. These results are analyzed in relation to their security relevance and scenarios of application. Finally, conditions for a successful remote Ethernet Packet-In-Packet injection will be discussed and demonstrated for what is believed to be the first time in public. \n \n Funderbolt: Adventures in Thunderbolt DMA Attacks Intel's Thunderbolt allows for high-speed data transfers for a variety of peripherals including high-resolution high-bandwidth graphics displays, all using the same physical connection. This convenience comes at a bit of a cost: an external port into your computer's bus and possibly memory! Thunderbolt ports appear on high-end laptops like the MacBook Pro, but also increasingly on PC hardware, and on newer desktop and server motherboards. This proprietary technology is undocumented but problems with it could potentially undermine the privacy and security of users. This talk chronicles process of exploring these risks through a practical exercise in reverse engineering. Experience the tribulations with reversing Thunderbolt chips, understand the attack strategies for exploiting DMA and see the pitfalls one encounters along the way, while gaining a deeper understanding of the risks of this new feature. \n \n Presented by Russ Sevinsky \n \n Hacking like in the Movies: Visualizing Page Tables for Local Exploitation A shiny and sparkling way to break user-space ASLR, kernel ASLR and even find driver bugs! Understanding how a specific Operating System organizes its Page Tables allow you to find your own ASLR bypasses and even driver vulnerabilities. We will drop one 0day Android ASLR bypass as an example; you can then break all your other expensive toys yourself. Page Tables are the data structures that map between the virtual address space your programs see to the actual physical addresses identifying locations on your physical RAM chips. We will visualize these data structures for: Windows 8 on x86_64 \n \n Windows 8 RT on ARMv7 \n \n Linux 3.8 on x86_64 \n \n Linux 3.4 on ARMv7 alias Android 4.2 \n \n XNU on x86_64 alias OS X \n \n XNU on ARMv7 alias iOS Besides showing pretty pictures, we will actually explain what they show and how to interpret commonalities and differences across the same kernel on different architectures. By comparing the page table state on the same architecture across different runs, we will identify static physical mappings created by drivers, which can be useful for DMA attacks (think FireWire or Thunderbolt forensics). Static virtual mappings are even more interesting and can be used for (K)ASLR bypasses. To make a final point, that this is not only nice to look at, we will show how we found a mitigated Android <= 4.0.x generic user-space ASLR bypass. For those interested in actually owning targets, we will show an Android 4.2.2 generic user-space ASLR bypass that also affects other latest Linux/ARM kernels. \n \n Hacking, Surveilling, and Deceiving victims on Smart TV Smart TVs sold over 80,000,000 units around the world in 2012. This next generation \"smart\" platform is becoming more and more popular. On the other hand, we hardly see security research on Smart TVs. This presentation will cover vulnerabilities we've found on the platform. You can imagine that Smart TVs have almost the exact same attack vectors that PC and Smart Phones have. Also, Smart TVs have interesting new attack surface such as the remote controller. We'll talk about attack points for Smart TV platform and cover security bugs we discovered. This talk will mostly focus on what attackers can do on a hacked Smart TV. For example, expensive Smart TVs have many hardware devices like a Camera or Mic which, if remotely controlled, means bad guys can spy remotely without you knowing. Even more, it is possible to make Smart TVs monitor you 24/7 even though users turn off their TV, meaning #1984 could be done. In addition, we'll point out a difference of viewpoint on leaked information type among PC, Smart Phone and Smart TV. Lastly, we'll give demo of live remote surveillance cam, which is sent to attacker's server at this talk. This talk is an extended version of one, which I gave at CANSECWEST. It will demonstrate a spoofed news story on a hacked Smart TV and possibly TVshing (Smart TV edition of phishing.) \n \n Presented by SeungJin 'Beist' Lee \n \n Hiding @ Depth - Exploring, Subverting and Breaking NAND Flash memory In the world of digital storage, gone are the days of spinning platters and magnetic residue. These technologies have been replaced with electron trapping, small voltage monitoring and a lot of magic. These NAND devices are ubiquitous across our culture; from smart phones to laptops to USB memory sticks to GPS navigation devices. We carry many of these devices in our pockets daily without considering the security implications. The NAND-Xplore project is an attempt to explain how NAND Flash storage functions and to expose logical weaknesses in the hardware and implementation architectures. The project also showcases how the vulnerable underpinnings of NAND hardware can be subverted to hide and persist files on mobile devices. The project will release two open source POC tools for Android, one to inject and hide files on raw NAND based devices and another to find those files. The tools will showcase how advanced malware or other offensive tools could be using NAND to hide peristent files on your devices and how you would go about discovering them. The project also considers how typical forensic software interacts with NAND devices and how those tools can be subverted. Lastly, the talk will cover how remote NAND manipulation can brick devices beyond repair, from Smartphones to SCADA, and how this vulnerability cannot realistically be patched or fixed (Hint: your current tools probably don't work as well as you would like to believe). \n \n Presented by Josh 'm0nk' Thomas \n \n Home Invasion v2.0 - Attacking Network-Controlled Hardware A growing trend in electronics is to have them integrate with your home network in order to provide potentially useful features like automatic updates or to extend the usefulness of existing technologies such as door locks you can open and close from anywhere in the world. What this means for us as security professionals or even just as people living in a world of network-connected devices is that being compromised poses greater risk than before. Once upon a time, a compromise only meant your data was out of your control. Today, it can enable control over the physical world resulting in discomfort, covert audio/video surveillance, physical access or even personal harm. If your door lock or space heater are compromised, you're going to have a very bad day. This talk will discuss the potential risks posed by network-attached devices and even demonstrate new attacks against products on the market today. \n \n Honey, I\u2019m home!! - Hacking Z-Wave Home Automation Systems Home automation systems provide a centralized control and monitoring function for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC), lighting and physical security systems. The central control panel and various household devices such as security sensors and alarm systems are connected with each other to form a mesh network over wireless or wired communication links and act as a \u201csmart home\u201d. As you arrive home, the system can automatically open the garage door, unlock the front door and disable the alarm, light the downstairs, and turn on the TV. According to a study by the consulting firm AMA Research, in 2011, the UK home automation market was worth around \u00a365 million with 12% increase on the previous year. The total number of home automation system installations in the UK is estimated to be 189000 by now. The home automation market in the US was worth approximately $3.2 billion in 2010 and is expected to exceed $5.5 billion in 2016. Zigbee and Z-wave wireless communication protocols are the most common used RF technology in home automation systems. Zigbee is based on an open specification (IEEE 802.15.4) and has been the subject of several academic and practical security researches. Z-wave is a proprietary wireless protocol that works in the Industrial, Scientific and Medical radio band (ISM). It transmits on the 868.42 MHz (Europe) and 908.42MHz (United States) frequencies designed for low-bandwidth data communications in embedded devices such as security sensors, alarms and home automation control panels. Unlike Zigbee, no public security research on Z-Wave protocol was available before our work. Z-wave protocol was only mentioned once during a DefCon 2011 talk when the presenter pointed the possibility of capturing the AES key exchange phase without a demonstration. The Z-Wave protocol is gaining momentum against the Zigbee protocol with regards to home automation. This is partly due to a faster, and somewhat simpler, development process. Another benefit is that it is less subjected to signal interference compared to the Zigbee protocol, which operates on the widely populated 2.4 GHz band shared by both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi devices. Z-wave chips have 128-bit AES crypto engines, which are used by access control systems, such as door locks, for authenticated packet encryption. An open source implementation of the Z-wave protocol stack, openzwave , is available but it does not support the encryption part as of yet. Our talk will show how the Z-Wave protocol can be subjected to attacks. \n \n Hot Knives Through Butter: Bypassing Automated Analysis Systems Diamonds are girl\u2019s best friend, prime numbers are mathematician\u2019s best friend and automated analysis systems (AAS) are AV researcher\u2019s best friend. Unfortunately, this fact is known by malware authors and hence techniques to evade automated analysis system are not only becoming an integral part of APT, but also many infamous malwares have resurrected and are using techniques to bypass the automated analysis system to stay under the radar. The infamous Khelios botnet was claimed to be dead in 2011 and got resurrected . To evade the automated analysis system one of the sample aka Trojan Nap found in 2013, was employing SleepEx() API with a 10 minutes time out. Since automated analysis systems are set to execute a sample within a given time frame ,which is in seconds, by employing an extended sleep call, it could prevent an AAS from capturing its behavior. The sample also made a call to the undocumented API NtDelayExecution() for performing an extended sleep calls. As per the report from Mandiant, infamous RAT Poison IVY has extensively been used in the targeted attacks and appeared to have been abandoned in 2008. Trojan UpClicker, reported in December 2012, a wrapper around Poison IVY, employs SetWindowsHookEX() API to hide its malicious activity. By sending 0EH as parameter to the function, the malicious code only gets activated when the left mouse button is clicked and released. Since in AAS there is no human interaction, the code remains dormant bypassing the AAS. PushDo, yet another infamous malware, checks the build number of windows OS. Once it has determined the build number of windows OS. It finds a pointer to PspCreateProcessNotify() API routine to deregister all the callbacks. Once the callbacks have been deregistered, the malware can create or delete processes, bypassing process monitoring module of AAS. Trojan Hastati was designed to wipe out all the hard drives of a computer in Korea. It used GetLocalTime() API to activate itself on March 20th 2013 at 2:00 P.M. If the sample is executed in an AAS before the 20th March 2013, it will not get executed and evades AAS. UpClicker, PushDo, Hastati, Nap are some of the resurrected advanced malware and/or APT which are using anti evasion techniques to evade detections from AAS. In first part of the presentation we provide an exhaustive list of techniques, API\u2019s and the code segments from the APT and active malware, which are being used to bypass the AAS. We will also have live demonstration of some of the anti-analysis techniques, which have emerged in the recent past. In the next part of the presentation we provide an in-depth, technical analysis of the Automated Analysis System technologies available today focusing on computer security aspect. It will provide a comparison framework for different technologies that is consistent, measurable, and understandable by both IT administrators and security specialists. In addition we also explore each of the major commercially available automated analysis system flavors and evaluate their ability to stand against these evasions. We will present an architectural decomposition of automated analysis systems to highlight its advantages and limitations, and historical view on how fast Anti-AAS techniques have been evolved so rapidly recently. This will kick start the conversation on how new vectors that are likely to be used by sophisticated malware to actively target AAS in the future. \n \n HOW CVSS is DOSsing YOUR PATCHING POLICY (and wasting your money) CVSS score is widely used as the standard-de-facto risk metric for vulnerabilities, to the point that the US Government itself encourages organizations in using it to prioritize vulnerability patching. We tackle this approach by testing the CVSS score in terms of its efficacy as a \"risk score\" and \"prioritization metric.\" We test the CVSS against real attack data and as a result, we show that the overall picture is not satisfactory: the (lower-bound) over-investment by using CVSS to choose what vulnerabilities to patch can as high as 300% of an optimal one. We extend the analysis making sure to obtain statistically significant results. However, we present our results at a practical level, focusing on the question: \"does it make sense for you to use CVSS to prioritize your vulnerabilities?\" \n \n How to Build a SpyPhone Learn how to build an Android SpyPhone service that can be injected into any application. The presentation will feature a live demonstration of how phones can be tracked and operated from a Web based command and control server and a demonstration of how to inject the SpyPhone service into any Android application. The presentation will also cover the APIs used to track the phone's location, intercept phone calls and SMS messages, extract e-mail and contact lists, and activate the camera and microphone without being detected. \n \n Presented by Kevin McNamee \n \n How to Grow a TREE (Taint-enabled Reverse Engineering Environment) From CBASS (Cross-platform Binary Automated Symbolic-execution System) Binary analysis techniques from academic research have been introduced into the reverse engineering community as well as research labs that are equipped with lots of computing power. Some program analyses using these techniques have even begun to show up in hacker conferences. But significant limitations remain: No practical toolset delivers analyses of binary programs across multiple platforms (like x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC etc.); \n \n No practical toolset scales to real-world large programs and automates all aspects of highly sophisticated tasks like vulnerability analysis and exploit generation; \n \n No practical toolset runs on a typical engineer\u2019s laptop or integrates seamlessly with any popular reverse engineering environment. Interested reverse engineers must switch back and forth between their familiar tool environment and some Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) environment (like PIN) or full system emulator (like QEMU). In this talk, we will present our solution to these limitations. We will explain the Cross-platform Binary Automated Symbolic-execution System (CBASS) that we developed and demonstrate one of its interactive applications: an IDA based Taint-enabled Reverse Engineering Environment (TREE). TREE can deliver program analysis techniques (taint analysis, dynamic slicing, symbolic execution and constraint solving) into the reverse engineer\u2019s hands now. Binary analysis and its security applications have been extensively researched, mainly in the context of a single instruction set architecture (predominantly x86) and popular desktop operating systems (Linux or Windows). CBASS performs its binary analysis on a common Intermediate Representation (IR) rather than on the native Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) of any program. This thin layer allows our powerful analysis tools to work on cross-platform binary applications. While CBASS supports both automated and interactive security applications, TREE supports a subset of these capabilities but from with an IDA Pro plug-in. TREE provides useful interactive visualizations of the results of on-demand binary analysis. Symbolic execution and concolic execution (concrete-symbolic execution) are fundamental techniques used in binary analysis; but they are plagued by the exponential path explosion problem. Solving this problem requires vigorous path pruning algorithms and highly parallel computing infrastructure (like clouds). Neither of these is typically available to a reverse engineer. TREE solves this problem by helping the reverse engineer prioritize path execution through an interactive and intuitive visual representation of the results of on-demand analysis of what inputs and instruction sequences led to the crash site or other suspicious path, leverage path constraints and SMT solver to negate tainted branch condition for a new, unexplored path. The details of the taint analysis, dynamic slicing and path constraint solving mechanisms are transparent to reverse engineer. Utilizing the existing IDA Pro debugging infrastructure, TREE can automate trace generation from diversified target platforms, including kernel mode tracing for Windows. To our surprise, despite the fact that IDA Pro debugging API has been around for a long time, there has been no serious effort to automate trace collection for extensible binary analysis, particularly for kernel mode tracing. Our work has directly contributed to two bug fixes in the latest IDA Pro patches (IDA 6.4.130206). Our presentation will feature several case studies of using TREE to analyze real world vulnerabilities. \n \n Hunting the Shadows: In Depth Analysis of Escalated APT Attacks APT attacks are a new emerging threat and have made headlines in recent years. However, we have yet to see full-scale assessment of targeted attack operations. Taiwan has been a long term target for these cyber-attacks due to its highly developed network infrastructure and sensitive political position. We had a unique chance to monitor, detect, investigate, and mitigate a large number of attacks on government and private sector companies. This presentation will introduce our results of a joint research between Xecure-Lab and Academia Sinica on targeted attack operations across the Taiwan Strait. We have developed a fully automated system, XecScan 2.0 (http://scan.xecure-lab.com) equipped with unique dynamic (sandbox) and static malicious software forensics technology to analyze nature and behavior of malicious binaries and document exploits. The system performs real-time APT classification and associates the analyzed content with existing knowledge base. In our experiments, the XecScan system has analyzed and successfully identified more than 12,000 APT emails, which include APT Malware and Document Exploits. With this presentation we will also analyze and group the samples from the recent Mandiant APT1(61398) Report and will compare the relationships between APT1 samples to the samples discovered in Taiwan and discuss the history behind APT1 Hacker activities. During this presentation we will release a free, publicly accessible portal to our collaborative APT classification platform and access to the XecScan 2.0 APIs. \n \n I Can Hear You Now: Traffic Interception and Remote Mobile Phone Cloning with a Compromised CDMA Femtocell I have a box on my desk that your CDMA cell phone will automatically connect to while you send and receive phone calls, text messages, emails, and browse the Internet. I own this box. I watch all the traffic that crosses it and you don't even know you're connected to me. Welcome to the New World, where I, not them, own the towers. Oh, and thanks for giving me the box... for free. This box is a femtocell, a low-power cellular base station given or sold to subscribers by mobile network operators. It works just like a small cell tower, using a home Internet connection to interface with the provider network. When in range, a mobile phone will connect to a femtocell as if it were a standard cell tower and send all its traffic through it without any indication to the user. The state-of-the-art authentication protecting cell phone networks can be an imposing target. However, with the rising popularity of femtocells there is more than one way to attack a cellular network. Inside, they run Linux, and they can be hacked. During this talk, we will demonstrate how we've used a femtocell for traffic interception of voice/SMS/data, active network attacks, and explain how we were able to clone a mobile device without physical access. \n \n Implantable Medical Devices: Hacking Humans In 2006 approximately 350,000 pacemakers and 173,000 ICD's (Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators) were implanted in the US alone. 2006 was an important year, as that's when the FDA began approving fully wireless based devices. Today there are well over 3 million pacemakers and over 1.7 million ICD's in use. This talk will focus on the security of wireless implantable medical devices. I will discuss how these devices operate and communicate and the security shortcomings of the current protocols. Our internal research software will be revealed that utilizes a common bedside transmitter to scan for, and interrogate individual medical implants. I will also discuss ideas manufacturers can implement to improve the security of these devices. \n \n Presented by Barnaby Jack \n \n Is that a government in your network or are you just happy to see me? Defense and military network operations center around the age-old game: establishing long-term footholds deep inside a network. In this talk, we will discuss specific techniques and tactics observed while providing defensive incident response services to organizations compromised by foreign intelligence and defense agencies. The discussion will also incorporate the release and open-sourcing of several private projects used to identify pass-the-hash/impersonation attacks, including: a set of network monitoring daemons known as breachbox, part of which was funded by DARPA's Cyber Fast Track program; and an open-source tool and blueprint to help trojanize your own network to monitor and detect adversarial activity. \n \n Presented by Eric Fiterman \n \n Java Every-Days: Exploiting Software Running on 3 Billion Devices Over the last three years, Oracle Java has become the exploit author's best friend, and why not? Java has a rich attack surface, broad install base, and runs on multiple platforms allowing attackers to maximize their return-on-investment. The increased focus on uncovering weaknesses in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) shifted research beyond classic memory corruption issues into abuses of the reflection API that allow for remote code execution. This talk focuses on the vulnerability trends in Java over the last three years and intersects public vulnerability data with Java vulnerabilities submitted to the Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) program. We begin by reviewing Java's architecture and patch statistics to identify a set of vulnerable Java components. We then highlight the top five vulnerability types seen in ZDI researcher submissions that impact these JRE components and emphasize their recent historical significance. The presentation continues with an in-depth look at specific weaknesses in several Java sub-components, including vulnerability details and examples of how the vulnerabilities manifest and what vulnerability researchers should look for when auditing the component. Finally, we discuss how attackers typically leverage weaknesses in Java. We focus on specific vulnerability types attackers and exploit kits authors are using and what they are doing beyond the vulnerability itself to compromise machines. We conclude with details on the vulnerabilities that were used in this year's Pwn2Own competition and review steps Oracle has taken to address recent issues uncovered in Java. \n \n Javascript Static Security Analysis made easy with JSPrime Today, more and more developers are switching to JavaScript as their first choice of language. The reason is simple JavaScript has now been started to be accepted as the mainstream programming for applications, be it on the web or on the mobile; be it on client-side, be it on the server side. JavaScript flexibility and its loose typing is friendly to developers to create rich applications at an unbelievable speed. Major advancements in the performance of JavaScript interpreters, in recent days, have almost eliminated the question of scalability and throughput from many organizations. So the point is JavaScript is now a really important and powerful language we have today and it's usage growing everyday. From client-side code in web applications it grew to server-side through Node.JS and it's now supported as proper language to write applications on major mobile operating system platforms like Windows 8 apps and the upcoming Firefox OS apps. But the problem is, many developers practice in-secure coding which leads to many clients side attacks, out of which DOM XSS is the most infamous. We tried to understand the root cause of this problem and figured out is that there are not enough practically usable tools that can solve real-world problems. Hence as our first attempt towards solving this problem, we want to talk about JSPrime: A javascript static analysis tool for the rest of us. It's a very light-weight and very easy to use point-and-click tool! The static analysis tool is based on the very popular Esprima ECMAScript parser by Aria Hidayat. I would like to highlight some of the interesting features of the tool below: JS Library Aware Source & Sinks \n \n Most dynamic or static analyzers are developed to support native/pure JavaScript which actually is a problem for most developers since the introductions and wide-adoption for JavaScript frameworks/libraries like jQuery, YUI etc. Since these scanners are designed to support pure JavaScript, they fail at understanding the context of the development due to the usage of libraries and produce many false-positives and false-negatives. To solve this we have identified the dangerous user input sources and code execution sink functions for jQuery and YUI, for the initial release and we shall talk about how users can easily extend it for other frameworks. \n \n Variable & Function Tracing \n \n This feature is a part of our code flow analysis algorithm \n \n Variable & Function Scope Aware analysis \n \n This feature is a part of our code flow analysis algorithm \n \n Known filter function aware \n \n OOP & Protoype Compliant \n \n Minimum False Positive alerts \n \n Supports minified javascript \n \n Blazing fast performance \n \n Point and Click :-) (my personal favorite) Upcoming features: Automatic code de-obfuscation & decompression through Hybrid Analysis (Ra.2 improvisation; http://code.google.com/ra2-dom-xss-scanner) \n \n ECMAScript family support (ActionScript 3, Node.JS, WinJS) \n \n Just-In-Time Code Reuse: The more things change, the more they stay the same Fine-grained address space layout randomization (ASLR) has recently been proposed as a method of efficiently mitigating runtime attacks. In this presentation, we introduce the design and implementation of a framework based on a novel attack strategy, dubbed just-in-time code reuse, which both undermines the benefits of fine-grained ASLR and greatly enhances the ease of exploit development on today's platforms that combine standard ASLR and DEP (e.g. Windows 8). Specifically, we derail the assumptions embodied in fine-grained ASLR by exploiting the ability to repeatedly abuse a memory disclosure to map an application's memory layout on-the-fly, dynamically discover API functions and gadgets, and JIT-compile a target program using those gadgets-- all within a script environment at the time an exploit is launched. We demonstrate the power of our framework by using it in conjunction with a real-world exploit against Internet Explorer, show its effectiveness in Windows 8, and also provide extensive evaluations that demonstrate the practicality of just-in-time code reuse attacks. Our findings suggest that fine-grained ASLR may not be as promising as first thought. \n \n KickaaS Defense with Cloud and Software Defined Security While everyone else is busy spreading uneducated FUD on the supposed insecurity of cloud computing, the reality is cloud computing, and it's foundational technologies, bring tools to the table security pros previously could only dream of. Virtualization, segregation, and isolation are now defaults, not hard-to-achieve end states. Security is decoupled and abstracted from infrastructure, enabling levels of granularity and control nearly impossible with traditional architectures. APIs bind it all together, powering insanely effective security automation and intelligence. This session will present practical techniques to leverage cloud computing and API-driven Software Defined Security to build stronger, more resilient, and more responsive defenses than aren't even close to possible with traditional infrastructure. We'll show what works today, including technical demonstrations, and tell you what to expect once security vendors wake up and really start riding the wave. \n \n Presented by Rich Mogull \n \n Lawful Access Panel Protecting yourself, your network and your users when the FBI or NSA knocks: When you get a National Security Letter, no one can hear you scream. Being served with a search warrant for a criminal investigation can be scary enough, but national security investigations can be downright Kafkaesque. You probably won't be allowed to tell anyone about it. And they may ask for more than just user data, such as for backdoor access or to install special monitoring hardware or software deep inside your network. This panel will bring together a range of expertise on the perils of secret \"lawful intercepts\" in today's networks. We'll discuss the technical risks of surveillance architectures, the legal and technical defenses against over-broad or invasive searches, and actual experiences fighting against secret surveillance orders. \n \n Legal Aspects of Full Spectrum Computer Network (Active) Defense Full spectrum computer network (active) defense mean more than simply \u201chacking back.\u201d We\u2019ve seen a lot of this issue lately. Orin Kerr and Stewart Baker had a lengthy debate about it online. New companies with some high visibility players claim they are providing \u201cactive defense\u201d services to their clients. But all-in-all, what does this really mean? And why is it that when you go to your attorneys, they say a flat out, \u201cNo.\u201d This presentation examines the entire legal regime surrounding full spectrum computer network (active) defense. It delves into those areas that are easily legal and looks at the controversial issues surrounding others. As such we will discuss technology and sensors (ECPA and the service provider exception); information control and management (DRM); and, \u201cactive defense\u201d focusing on \u2013 honeypot, beacons, deception (say hello to my little friend the Security and Exchange Commission); open source business intelligence gathering (CFAA, economic espionage; theft of trade secrets); trace back and retrieval of stolen data (CFAA). Past presentations have shown much of what is taken away is audience driven in response to their questions and the subsequent discussion. And, as always, I try to impress upon computer security professionals the importance of working closely with their legal counsel early and often, and of course \u201cClark\u2019s Law\u201d - explain the technical aspects of computer security to your attorneys at a third grade level so they can understand it and then turn around and explain it to a judge or jury at a first grade level. \n \n Presented by Robert Clark \n \n Legal Considerations for Cellular Research The security of mobile communications is becoming increasingly critical, prompting security researchers to focus their attention on vulnerabilities in cellular systems. Researchers need to fully understand the legal ramifications of interacting with specialized hardware, cellular communications, and the restrictions imposed by service providers. This briefing will provide a legal overview of what a researcher should keep in mind when investigating mobile communications, technologies, and networks. We will cover legal issues raised by end user license agreements, jailrooting or rooting devices, and intercepting communications. \n \n Lessons from Surviving a 300Gbps Denial of Service Attack On Saturday, March 23, 2013, a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against Spamhaus that had been growing for weeks culminated with over 300 Gigabits per second of attack traffic targeting the anti-spam organization's network. At that point it became the largest such attack ever reported in history \u2014 at least 4x the size of the attacks that crippled US banks just a few months earlier. The attackers launched the full range DDoS methods at Spamhaus \u2014 simultaneously targeting Layer 3, Layer 4, and Layer 7. Spamhaus has given us permission to tell the full, behind-the-scenes story of what happened, show how the attacks were launched, outline the techniques the attackers used, and detail how Spamhaus.com was able to stay online throughout. While the Spamhaus story has a happy ending, the massive DDoS exposed key vulnerabilities throughout the Internet that we will need address if the network is to survive the next, inevitably larger, attack. \n \n Presented by Matthew Prince \n \n Let's get physical: Breaking home security systems and bypassing buildings controls 36 million home & office security systems reside in the U.S., and they are all vulnerable. This is not your grandpa\u2019s talk on physical security; this talk is about bypassing home and office digital physical security systems, from simple door sensors to intercepting signals and even the keypad before it can alert the authorities. All the methods presented are for covert entry and leave no physical sign of entry or compromise. If you are interested in bettering your skills as a pen tester or just want to know how break into an office like a Hollywood spy this is the talk for you. Come join us to see live demos of what the security companies never want you to see. \n \n Mactans: Injecting Malware into iOS Devices via Malicious Chargers Apple iOS devices are considered by many to be more secure than other mobile offerings. In evaluating this belief, we investigated the extent to which security threats were considered when performing everyday activities such as charging a device. The results were alarming: despite the plethora of defense mechanisms in iOS, we successfully injected arbitrary software into current-generation Apple devices running the latest operating system (OS) software. All users are affected, as our approach requires neither a jailbroken device nor user interaction. In this presentation, we demonstrate how an iOS device can be compromised within one minute of being plugged into a malicious charger. We first examine Apple\u2019s existing security mechanisms to protect against arbitrary software installation, then describe how USB capabilities can be leveraged to bypass these defense mechanisms. To ensure persistence of the resulting infection, we show how an attacker can hide their software in the same way Apple hides its own built-in applications. To demonstrate practical application of these vulnerabilities, we built a proof of concept malicious charger, called Mactans, using a BeagleBoard. This hardware was selected to demonstrate the ease with which innocent-looking, malicious USB chargers can be constructed. While Mactans was built with limited amount of time and a small budget, we also briefly consider what more motivated, well-funded adversaries could accomplish. Finally, we recommend ways in which users can protect themselves and suggest security features Apple could implement to make the attacks we describe substantially more difficult to pull off. \n \n Mainframes: The Past Will Come Back to Haunt You From governments to military, airlines to banks, the mainframe is alive and well and touches you in everything you do. The security community that's tasked with reviewing the security on mainframes, though, actually knows very little about these beasts. Be it a lack of access by the security community or the false notion that mainframes are dead, there is a distinct gap between the IT security world and the mainframe world. Mainframes in the IT security community are talked about in whispered hushed tones in the back alleys. Neither knowing if they're as secure as IBM (and mainframers) claim or if they're ripe with configuration problems ready to be exploited. This talk will remove some of the mystery surrounding the mainframe, breaking down that 'legacy wall.' Discussing how security is implemented on the mainframe (including where to find configuration files), how to access it, simple networking and configuration commands, file structure etc. will be presented at this session. \n \n Presented by Philip Young \n \n Maltego Tungsten as a collaborative attack platform Maltego has always been a strong favorite for pre-attack intelligence gathering - be that for social engineering, doxing or for infrastructure mapping. Indeed it's earned its rightful place in the Kali Linux top 10 tools. For as long as we can remember we at Paterva were annoyed that Maltego lacked the ability to share intelligence effectively. Up to now the only way to share graphs was to send the actual files around. This is all about to change - with Maltego Tungsten. The Tungsten release (at BlackHat) allows multiple users to share graphs in real time. This creates interesting opportunities and new workflows - suddenly we can have a team of analysts and/or pen testers working together in real time and on the same goal. Be it profiling (or 'doxing') a human target or attacking a network - with real time graph sharing we now have a platform where information can be safely (and anonymously) shared as it happens. The other lacking aspect of Maltego was real bite. In the past we purposely stayed away from all out attack - concentrating rather on info gathering. In this talk we'll also show how to integrate Maltego with industry standard attack tools. This will range from infrastructure attacks, web platform attack and remote Trojans to social engineering as well as denial of service. Combine human intelligence, machines (introduced in Radium release) and real time collaboration with these powerful transforms and wait... oh noes...we've created a monster!! \n \n Million Browser Botnet Online advertising networks can be a web hacker\u2019s best friend. For mere pennies per thousand impressions (that means browsers) there are service providers who allow you to broadly distribute arbitrary javascript -- even malicious javascript! You are SUPPOSED to use this \u201cfeature\u201d to show ads, to track users, and get clicks, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to abide. Absolutely nothing prevents spending $10, $100, or more to create a massive javascript-driven browser botnet instantly. The real-world power is spooky cool. We know, because we tested it\u2026 in-the-wild. With a few lines of HTML5 and javascript code we\u2019ll demonstrate just how you can easily commandeer browsers to perform DDoS attacks, participate in email spam campaigns, crack hashes and even help brute-force passwords. Put simply, instruct browsers to make HTTP requests they didn\u2019t intend, even something as well-known as Cross-Site Request Forgery. With CSRF, no zero-days or malware is required. Oh, and there is no patch. The Web is supposed to work this way. Also nice, when the user leaves the page, our code vanishes. No traces. No tracks. Before leveraging advertising networks, the reason this attack scenario didn\u2019t worry many people is because it has always been difficult to scale up, which is to say, simultaneously control enough browsers (aka botnets) to reach critical mass. Previously, web hackers tried poisoning search engine results, phishing users via email, link spamming Facebook, Twitter and instant messages, Cross-Site Scripting attacks, publishing rigged open proxies, and malicious browser plugins. While all useful methods in certain scenarios, they lack simplicity, invisibility, and most importantly -- scale. That\u2019s what we want! At a moment\u2019s notice, we will show how it is possible to run javascript on an impressively large number of browsers all at once and no one will be the wiser. Today this is possible, and practical. \n \n Multiplexed Wired Attack Surfaces Manufacturers of mobile devices often multiplex several wired interfaces onto a single connector. Some of these interfaces, probably intended for test and development, are still enabled when the devices ship. We'll show you how you can get a shell on a popular mobile phone via its USB port without using a USB connection and we will release an open source tool for exploring multiplexed wired interfaces. \n \n OptiROP: hunting for ROP gadgets in style Return-Oriented-Programming (ROP) is the fundamental technique to bypass the widely-used DEP-based exploitation mitigation. Unfortunately, available tools that can help to find ROP gadgets mainly rely on syntactic searching. This method proves to be in inefficient, time-consuming and makes the process of developing ROP-based shellcode pretty frustrated for exploitation writers. This research attempts to solve the problem by introducing a tool named OptiROP that lets exploitation writers search for ROP gadgets with semantic queries. OptiROP supports input binary of all executable formats (PE/ELF/Mach-O) on x86 & x86_64 architectures. Combining sophisticated techniques such as code normalization, code optimization, code slicing, SMT solver, parallel processing and some heuristic searching methods, OptiROP is able to discover desired gadgets very quickly, with much less efforts. Our tool also provides the detail semantic meaning of each gadget found, so users can easily decide how to chain their gadgets for the final shellcode. In case where no suitable gadget is found, OptiROP tries to pick and chain available gadgets to create a sequence of gadgets satisfying the input requirements. This significantly eases the hard job of shellcode writers, so they can focus their time on other tedious parts of the exploitation process. Our talk will entertain the audience with some live demo, so they can see how OptiROP generates gadgets in reality. \n \n Presented by Nguyen Anh Quynh \n \n Out of Control: Demonstrating SCADA device exploitation America\u2019s next great oil and gas boom is here: the United States is on track to become the world\u2019s top oil producer by 2020. New wells require new pipelines to distribute their bounty. These oil and gas pipelines crisscross the country carrying volatile fluids through densely populated areas. What runs these pipelines? How are they controlled? What happens when the process goes out of control? \n \n The Outer Limits: Hacking the Samsung Smart TV There is nothing wrong with your television set. Do not attempt to adjust the picture. We are controlling the transmission. \"Smart\" TVs are becoming more and more common. Samsung and other vendors such as Sony and LG have sold more than a hundred million Smart TVs in the last few years. During this talk, Aaron Grattafiori and Josh Yavor will discuss the Samsung SmartTV design, attack surfaces and overall insecurity of the platform. A short discussion of the current application stack, TV operating system and other details will be provided to help set the stage for details of significant flaws found within the Samsung SmartTV application architecture, APIs and current applications. A number of vulnerabilities will be explored and demonstrated which allow malicious developers or remotely hijacked applications (such as the web browser or social media applications) to take complete control of the TV, steal accounts stored within it and install a userland rootkit. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities also provides the ability for an attacker to use the front-facing video camera or built-in microphone for spying and surveillance as well as facilitate access to local network for continued exploitation. This talk will also discuss methods to bypass what (meager) security protections exist and put forth several worst case scenarios (TV worm anyone?). Concluding this talk, Aaron and Josh will discuss what has been fixed by Samsung and discuss what overall weaknesses should be avoided by future \"Smart\" platforms. Video demos of exploits and userland rootkits will be provided. \n \n Owning the Routing Table - Part II The holy grail of routing attacks is owning the routing table of a router. In this work we present a powerful OSPF attack that exploit a newly discovered ambiguity of the OSPF protocol -- the most popular routing protocol inside autonomous systems (AS). The attack allows an attacker who gained control over just a single router in an AS to control the routing tables of all other routers in that AS. The attack may be utilized to induce black holes, network cuts or longer routes in order to facilitate DoS of the routing domain or to gain access to information flows which otherwise the attacker had no access to. The attack can also be used to easily DoS a victim router using a single packet. A multi-vendor effort is now under way to fix this vulnerability which currently inflict many of today's OSPF routers. This work is a sequel to the work \"Owning the Routing Table\" we presented at Black Hat USA 2011. This is a joint work with Eitan Menahem, Yuval Elovici and Ariel Waizel of Telekom Innovation Laboratories at Ben Gurion University. \n \n Presented by Gabi Nakibly \n \n Pass the Hash and Other Credential Theft and Reuse: Mitigating the risk of Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation Pass the Hash (PtH) has become one of the most widespread attacks affecting our customers and many of our customers have made it their top priority to address these attacks. In response, Microsoft has assembled a workgroup to investigate effective and practical mitigations that could be used now as well as future platform modifications. This presentation will cover the problem of credential theft and re-use, focusing on Pass-the-Hash attacks as an example, and discuss Microsoft\u2019s recommended mitigations. The presenters are members of the workgroup: Patrick Jungles of the Trustworthy Computing group and Mark Simos of the Cybersecurity Services team. \n \n Pass-The-Hash 2: The Admin's Revenge Some vulnerabilities just can't be patched. Pass-The-Hash attacks against Windows enterprises are still successful and are more popular than ever. Since the PTH-Suite was released at Black Hat last year, Microsoft published their guide for mitigating the attack. Skip and Chris will cover some of the shortcomings in their strategies and offer practical ways to detect and potentially prevent hashes from being passed on your network. Learn how to stop an attacker's lateral movement in your enterprise. \n \n Pixel Perfect Timing Attacks with HTML5 Maybe you\u2019ve heard it before - HTML 5 and related technologies bring a whole slew of new features to web browsers, some of which can be a threat to security and privacy. But subtle interactions between the less explored corners of new browser features can have some unexpected and dangerous side effects. In this presentation, I\u2019ll introduce a number of new techniques that use JavaScript-based timing attacks to extract sensitive data from your browser. In my talk I will demonstrate cross-browser vulnerabilities against Chrome, Internet Explorer and Firefox that can be used to access your browsing history and read data from websites you\u2019re logged into. I\u2019ll also take a look at the difficulties involved in fixing these types of vulnerabilities. \n \n Presented by Paul Stone \n \n Post Exploitation Operations with Cloud Synchronization Services Cloud backup solutions, such as Dropbox, provide a convenient way for users to synchronize files between user devices. These services are particularly attractive to users, who always want the most current version of critical files on every device. Many of these applications \u201cinstall\u201d into the user\u2019s profile directory and the synchronization processes are placed in the user\u2019s registry hive (HKCU). Users without administrative privileges can use these applications without so much as popping a UAC dialog. This freedom makes illicit installations of these applications all the more likely. Cloud backup providers are marketing directly to corporate executives offering services that will \u201cincrease employee productivity\u201d or \u201cprovide virtual teaming opportunities.\u201d Offers such as these make it more likely than ever that any given corporate environment has some cloud backup solutions installed. We released the DropSmack tool at Blackhat EU. This showed enterprise defenders the risks posed by cloud synchronization software and gave pen testers a new toy to play with (you can bet that pen testers weren\u2019t the only ones who noticed). In response to feedback from the original presentation, DropSmack has been improved to deal with some of the unique operational challenges posed by synchronization environments. In particular, we added the ability to work with more synchronization services automatically. In this talk, we\u2019ll demonstrate how DropSmack v2 works and explain how to deploy it in an operational environment. We\u2019ll look at some of the countermeasures to these attacks, including the encryption of synchronized files by third party software. Additionally, we\u2019ll investigate the potential of using so-called \u201cnext generation firewalls\u201d to defeat DropSmack. You\u2019ll also learn about the issues of credential storage in the context of cloud synchronization services. Several synchronization applications also use insecure authentication methods. We\u2019ll highlight these applications so you know what works, what doesn\u2019t, and what you should run (not walk) away from. You\u2019ll learn about post-exploitation activities you can accomplish when your freshly compromised target is running a cloud synchronization product. Finally, we\u2019ll demonstrate the steps you need to follow to steal credentials for the products that store them. Why would you want to steal stored credentials for a cloud synchronization service you ask? After all, any files that have been synchronized to the cloud must already on the machine you just compromised, right? Not necessarily. You\u2019ll learn a variety of nasty things you can do with the cloud synchronization service portals that you may never have considered.,/ If you\u2019re a network defender, you\u2019ll leave this talk with a new appreciation of the risks posed by cloud synchronization services (and a nauseous feeling if you have them in your environment). If you are a penetration tester, you\u2019ll leave with a new bag of tricks. Either way, a fun time is sure to be had by all. \n \n Presented by Jacob Williams \n \n Power Analysis Attacks for Cheapskates Power analysis attacks present a devious method of cracking cryptographic systems. But looking at papers published in this field show that often the equipment used is fairly expensive: the typical oscilloscope used often has at least a 1 GSPS sampling rate, and then various probes and amplifiers also add to this cost. What is a poor researcher to do without such tools? This presentation will give a detailed description of how to setup a power analysis lab for a few hundred dollars, one that provides sufficient performance to attack real devices. It's based on some open-source hardware & software I developed, and is small enough to fit in your pocket. This will be demonstrated live against a microcontroller implementing AES, with details provided so attendees can duplicate the demonstration. This includes an open-hardware design for the capture board, open-source Python tools for doing the capture, and open-source example attacks. Underlying theory behind side-channel attacks will be presented, giving attendees a complete picture of how such attacks work. \n \n Presented by Colin O'Flynn \n \n Predicting Susceptibility to Social Bots on Twitter Are some Twitter users more naturally predisposed to interacting with social bots and can social bot creators exploit this knowledge to increase the odds of getting a response? Social bots are growing more intelligent, moving beyond simple reposts of boilerplate ad content to attempt to engage with users and then exploit this trust to promote a product or agenda. While much research has focused on how to identify such bots in the process of spam detection, less research has looked at the other side of the question\u2014detecting users likely to be fooled by bots. This talk provides a summary of research and developments in the social bots arms race before sharing results of our experiment examining user susceptibility. We find that a users\u2019 Klout score, friends count, and followers count are most predictive of whether a user will interact with a bot, and that the Random Forest algorithm produces the best classifier, when used in conjunction with appropriate feature ranking algorithms. With this knowledge, social bot creators could significantly reduce the chance of targeting users who are unlikely to interact. Users displaying higher levels of extraversion were more likely to interact with our social bots. This may have implications for eLearning based awareness training as users higher in extraversion have been shown to perform better when they have great control of the learning environment. Overall, these results show promise for helping understand which users are most vulnerable to social bots. \n \n Press ROOT to continue: Detecting OSX and Windows bootkits with RDFU UEFI has recently become a very public target for rootkits and malware. Last year at Black Hat 2012, Snare\u2019s insightful talk highlighted the real and very significant potential for developing UEFI rootkits that are very difficult, if not impossible, to detect and/or eradicate. Since then, a couple of practical bootkits have appeared. To combat this new threat, we developed a Rootkit Detection Framework for UEFI (\u201cRDFU\u201d) that incorporates a unified set of tools that address this problem across a wide spectrum of UEFI implementations. We will demonstrate a sample bootkit for Apple OSX that was designed specifically for testing purposes. As a UEFI driver, it infects the OSX kernel utilizing a UEFI \u201crootkit\u201d technique. The entire infection process executes in memory (by the UEFI driver itself). Therefore, the bootkit does not need to install any OSX kernel extension modules. The bootkit demonstrates the following functionality: Sniffing FileVault passwords (sniffing keys while booting) \n \n Privilege escalation (to root) \n \n Hiding PIDs, files, and directories with selected patterns Rootkit Detection Framework for UEFI was developed under DARPA CFT. Following this talk, we will publicly release the RDFU open source code along with whitepapers that outline a possible use case for this technology. \n \n Revealing Embedded Fingerprints: Deriving intelligence from USB stack interactions Embedded systems are everywhere, from TVs to aircraft, printers to weapons control systems. As a security researcher when you are faced with one of these \u201cblack boxes\u201d to test, sometime in-situ, it is difficult to know where to start. However, if there is a USB port on the device there is useful information that can be gained. This talk is about using techniques to analyze USB stack interactions to provide information such as the OS running on the embedded device, the USB drivers installed and devices supported. The talk will also cover some of the more significant challenges faced by researchers attempting to exploit USB vulnerabilities using a Windows 8 USB bug recently discovered by the presenter (MS13-027) as an example. \n \n Presented by Andy Davis \n \n RFID Hacking: Live Free or RFID Hard Have you ever attended an RFID hacking presentation and walked away with more questions than answers? This talk will finally provide practical guidance on how RFID proximity badge systems work. We\u2019ll cover what you\u2019ll need to build out your own RFID physical penetration toolkit, and how to easily use an Arduino microcontroller to weaponize commercial RFID badge readers \u2013 turning them into custom, long range RFID hacking tools. This presentation will NOT weigh you down with theoretical details, discussions of radio frequencies and modulation schemes, or talk of inductive coupling. It WILL serve as a practical guide for penetration testers to understand the attack tools and techniques available to them for stealing and using RFID proximity badge information to gain unauthorized access to buildings and other secure areas. Schematics and Arduino code will be released, and 100 lucky audience members will receive a custom PCB they can insert into almost any commercial RFID reader to steal badge info and conveniently save it to a text file on a microSD card for later use (such as badge cloning). This solution will allow you to read cards from up to 3 feet away, a significant improvement over the few centimeter range of common RFID hacking tools. Some of the topics we will explore are: Overview of best RFID hacking tools available to get for your toolkit \n \n Stealing RFID proximity badge info from unsuspecting passers-by \n \n Replaying RFID badge info and creating fake cloned cards \n \n Brute-forcing higher privileged badge numbers to gain data center access \n \n Attacking badge readers and controllers directly \n \n Planting PwnPlugs, Raspberry Pis, and similar devices as physical backdoors to maintain internal network access \n \n Creating custom RFID hacking tools using the Arduino \n \n Defending yourself from RFID hacking threats This DEMO-rich presentation will benefit both newcomers and seasoned professionals of the physical penetration testing field. \n \n Presented by Fran Brown \n \n Rooting SIM cards SIM cards are among the most widely-deployed computing platforms with over 7 billion cards in active use. Little is known about their security beyond manufacturer claims. Besides SIM cards\u2019 main purpose of identifying subscribers, most of them provide programmable Java runtimes. Based on this flexibility, SIM cards are poised to become an easily extensible trust anchor for otherwise untrusted smartphones, embedded devices, and cars. The protection pretense of SIM cards is based on the understanding that they have never been exploited. This talk ends this myth of unbreakable SIM cards and illustrates that the cards -- like any other computing system -- are plagued by implementation and configuration bugs. \n \n Presented by Karsten Nohl \n \n The SCADA That Didn't Cry Wolf- Who's Really Attacking Your ICS Devices- Part Deux! These attackers had a plan, they acted upon their plan, and they were successful. In my first presentation, given at Black Hat EU in 2013, I covered a robust ICS honeynet that I developed, and who was really attacking them. In this talk, I cover many of the same concepts, but I go several steps further- profiling the attackers that exploited my ICS honeynet. This talk will profile, provide intelligence, and list actors that attacked my ICS honeypot environment. This talk will also feature a demo of the attackers in progress, exfiltrating perceived sensitive data. In addition, I will discuss in greater detail how I geo-located these individuals, and tracked their movements, operations, and attacks. Some of the findings are truly surprising and substantial, and my not be what you think they are. This talk will release brand new statistics and attack details seen nowhere else in the ICS community. \n \n Presented by Kyle Wilhoit \n \n Smashing The Font Scaler Engine in Windows Kernel The Font Scaler Engine is widely used to scale the outline font definition such as TrueType/OpenType font for a glyph to a specific point size and converts the outline into a bitmap at a particular resolution. The revolution of font in computer that is mainly used for stylist purposes had make many users ignored its security issues. In fact, the Font Scaler engine could cause many security impacts especially in Windows kernel mode. In this talk, the basic structure of the Font Scaler engine will be discussed. This includes the conversion of an outline into a bitmap, the mathematical description of each glyph in an outline font, a set of instruction in each glyph that instruct the Font Scaler Engine to modify the shape of the glyph, and the instruction interpreter etc. Next, we introduce our smart font fuzzing method for identifying the new vulnerabilities of the Font Scaler engine. The different of dumb fuzzing and vulnerable functions will be explained and we will prove that the dumb fuzzing technique is not a good option for Windows Font Fuzzing. Lastly, we focus on the attack vector that could be used to launch the attacks remotely and locally. A demonstration of the new TrueType font vulnerabilities and the attack vector on Windows 8 and Windows 7 will be shown. \n \n SPY-JACKING THE BOOTERS It's become commonplace for security reporters and providers of security technologies to find themselves targets of hackers' wrath, especially when they put criminal activity under the spotlight. Earlier this year, Brian Krebs had done some work to expose a \"booter\" service. Like other public security figures, he found himself the target of repeated DDoS attacks. In Brian's case, this culminated in a \"SWATting\" attack -- a surprise visit by dozens of heavily armed police at his front door. Research on \"booter\" services reveals a relatively unsophisticated, but high-profit criminal community of DDoS-for-hire web sites that are capable of considerable impact. They operate under legal auspices, leveraging legitimate DDoS protection services. Anyone with an axe to grind and a small amount of money can hire one of these services to have virtually any person or web site knocked off the Internet. As an indicator of how mainstream these services have become, most of them accept payment via Paypal. This talk will delve into the recent proliferation of these malicious commercial DDoS services, and reveal what's been learned about their surreptitious functioning, exposing the proprietors behind these illicit services, and what is known about their targets and their thousands of paying customers. Emphasis will be placed on detailing the vulnerabilities present in most booter sites, and the lessons we can draw about how targets of these attacks can defend themselves. \n \n SSL, gone in 30 seconds - a BREACH beyond CRIME In this hands-on talk, we will introduce new targeted techniques and research that allows an attacker to reliably retrieve encrypted secrets (session identifiers, CSRF tokens, OAuth tokens, email addresses, ViewState hidden fields, etc.) from an HTTPS channel. We will demonstrate this new browser vector is real and practical by executing a PoC against a major enterprise product in under 30 seconds. We will describe the algorithm behind the attack, how the usage of basic statistical analysis can be applied to extract data from dynamic pages, as well as practical mitigations you can implement today. We will also describe the posture of different SaaS vendors vis-\u00e0-vis this attack. Finally, to provide the community with ability to build on our research, determine levels of exposure, and deploy appropriate protection, we will release the BREACH tool. \n \n Stepping P3wns: Adventures in full-spectrum embedded exploitation (and defense!) Our presentation focuses on two live demonstrations of exploitation and defense of a wide array of ubiquitous networked embedded devices like printers, phones and routers. The first demonstration will feature a proof-of-concept embedded worm capable of stealthy, autonomous polyspecies propagation. This PoC worm will feature at least one* 0-day vulnerability on Cisco IP phones as well as several embedded device vulnerabilities previously disclosed by the authors. We will demonstrate how an attacker can gain stealthy and persistent access to the victim network via multiple remote initial attack vectors against routers and printers. Once inside, we will show how the attacker can use other embedded devices as stepping-stones to compromise significant portions of the victim network without ever needing to compromise the general-purpose computers residing on the network. Our PoC worm is capable of network reconnaissance, manual full-mesh propagation between IP phones, network printers and common networking equipment. Finally, we will demonstrate fully autonomous reconnaissance and exploitation of all embedded devices on the demo network. The second demonstration showcases host-based embedded defense techniques, called Symbiotes, developed by the authors at Columbia University under support from DARPA\u2019s Cyber Fast Track and CRASH programs, as well as IARPA\u2019s STONESOUP and DHS\u2019s S&T Research programs. The Symbiote, is an OS and vendor agnostic host-based defense designed specifically for proprietary embedded systems. We will demonstrate the automated injection of Software Symbiotes into each vulnerable embedded device presented during the first demonstration. We then repeat all attack scenarios presented in the first demo against Symbiote defended devices to demonstrate real-time detection, alerting and mitigation of all malicious embedded implants used by our PoC worm. Lastly, we demonstrate the scalability and integration of Symbiote detection and alerting mechanisms into existing enterprise endpoint protection systems like Symantec End Point. Over the past two years we have discovered vulnerabilities in and and developed exploits for several embedded system. 2011 had not only the version agnostic Cisco IOS rootkit (\u201cKilling the Myth of Cisco IOS Diversity\u201d, Black Hat USA), but also the HP RFU vulnerability (\u201cPrint Me if You Dare\u201d, 28C3). In 2012 we presented the Cisco IP phone kernel vulnerability (\u201cHacking Cisco Phones\u201d, 29C3) . While each exploit focused on one device, we posited polyspecies malware propagation in which a device of one type could be used to exploit a device of a completely different type. In this presentation, we demonstrate an HP printer being used to exploit two different Cisco IP phones (which includes a yet-to-be-disclosed privilege escalation exploit in the 8900/9900 series). We may throw in a fourth yet-to-be-named device just for good measure. We then take the same devices on the same network and install host-based defense to detect or prevent the same exploits. \n \n Teridian SoC Exploitation: Exploration of harvard architecture smart grid systems The Teridian 8051 based chips are found in a variety of places in daily life, from the smart energy grid to smart cards and pin-pads. While the most prominent placement in the US is currently the metrology and power measurement side of a smart meters, the 8051 core is ubiquitous in embedded devices. They are additionally found in power distribution automation (the backend power shoveling inside your utility) and home automation (monitoring energy usage and changing configuration of appliances and similar in the home). The Teridian System-on-a-Chip platform wraps a complete system around a modified 8051 core, with additional features for chip security to block debug functionality and external access to memory. Additionally, the Harvard architecture design sets relatively rigid barriers between code and data (as opposed to x86/64), which presents an unintentional security barrier, somewhat similar to robust hardware DEP on x86/64 platforms. In this talk, we will quickly cover architecture and system overviews, then dive into exploitation scenarios with techniques to attack Harvard architecture systems and code security implementations. End state results include pathways to gain coveted binary images of firmware and resident code execution. \n \n TLS 'secrets' SSL and TLS have become the de-facto standards for transport-layer encryption. In recent years, many vulnerabilities have been uncovered in both the standards, their implementation and the way people configure and use them. This talk is exploring in details a lesser-known and much less talked about part of the standard which breaks some of the security properties one would expect. A tool allowing for forensic recovery of plaintext (even when PFS ciphers are in use) will be released. \n \n Presented by Florent 'NextGen$' Daigniere \n \n Town Hall Meeting: CFAA Reform Strategy Aaron Swartz, a brilliant computer programmer and activist, committed suicide in January. At the time of his passing, Aaron was facing criminal charges carrying the possibility of decades in prison based on his use of the MIT campus network to download millions of journal articles from a database of academic scholarship. Aaron's death has prompted a vigorous public debate about the factors that contributed to his tragedy, including the many problems with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, including its vague language and harsh penalty scheme. The information security community has an important role to play in educating and persuading lawmakers to reform this dangerous law. In this town hall meeting, join activists involved in CFAA reform efforts to discuss how you can get involved in the public debate around CFAA reform and strategize about how to have the most impact. \n \n Presented by Kurt Opsahl \n \n UART THOU MAD? Despite the fact that UART has been around FOREVER and is actually frequently used by vulnerability researchers in the hardware space, it has not been discussed as a dedicated topic on its own. This talk is intended to fill that gap. We will provide an overview of what UART is, the tools that exist to work with it and provide examples of why a security researcher should care. We will also explore why UART is a powerful friend for anyone who likes to repurpose hardware. We will also provide BKMs for companies building products that include UART to decrease the likelihood it will be used against them. \n \n Universal DDoS Mitigation Bypass Today's commercial DDoS mitigation technologies employ many different techniques for identifying DDoS traffics and blocking these threats. Common techniques range from basic malformed traffic check, to traffic profiling and rate limiting, to traffic source verification and so on, with captive redirection utilizing Javascript- or CAPTCHA-based authentications being the most effective by far. However, in our research weaknesses were found in each and every such technique. We rolled all our exploits into a PoC attack tool, giving it near-perfect DDoS mitigation bypass capability against all existing commercial DDoS mitigation solutions. The ramification is huge because for vast majority of web sites, these mitigation solutions stand as their last line of defense, having this last line breached can expose these web sites' backend to devastating damages. We have surveyed extensively the entire range of DDoS mitigation technologies available on the market today, uncovering the countermeasure techniques they employ, how they work and how to defeat each of them. Essentially bypass is achieved through emulating legit traffic characteristics. Afterwards our attack tool is introduced to demonstrate how all these exploits can be brought together to execute a \"combo attack\" to bypass all layers of protection in order to gain access to the backend. To coincide with the publication of this talk, our highly effective _attack_tool_will_be_made_freely_available_. The effectiveness of this tool is illustrated via testing results against specific DDoS mitigation products and popular web sites known to be protected by specific technologies. To conclude our research, a next-gen mitigation technique is also proposed as a countermeasure against our attack methodology. \n \n USING ONLINE ACTIVITY AS DIGITAL FINGERPRINTS TO CREATE A BETTER SPEAR PHISHER Every day we produce tons of digital breadcrumbs through our activities in online services \u2013 from social networks, photo sharing, mailing lists, online forums and blogs to more specialized tools, such as commits to open source projects, music listening services and travel schedules. These have long been known to provide useful information when profiling a target for social engineering purposes, especially due to the frantic pace and often uncensored way at which we generate such content. Our talk takes a tool-oriented approach to these profiling activities. By using data mining techniques combined with natural language processing, we can determine patterns in the way a user interacts with other users, his usual choice of vocabulary and phrasing, the friends/colleagues he most frequently communicates with as well as the topics discussed with them. By consuming publicly available data, using both official APIs and scraping web pages, our profile can be used to validate how close forged content is to actual target-generated data. We will discuss the indexing of unstructured content, including issues such as the legal and technical implications of using official APIs versus scraping, how to build user relationship graphs and how to add temporal references to the collected data. We will also release a tool that automates the data mining and natural language processing (NLP) of unstructured information available on public data sources, as well as comparing user created content against a generated profile using various criteria, including: Network of friends/colleagues; \n \n Frequency of communication with friends/colleagues; \n \n Shared interests between target and friends/colleagues; \n \n Hobbies and personal activities; \n \n Upcoming and past trips; \n \n Frequency of use of verbs; \n \n Frequency of use of adjectives; \n \n Frequency of use of nouns; \n \n Average number of words per sentence or paragraph. \n \n \n \n Virtual Deobfuscator - a DARPA Cyber Fast Track funded effort While there has been a lot research done on automatically reverse engineering of virtualization obfuscators, there has been no approach that did not require a lot of man-hours identifying the bytecode (static approaches) or a complete recreation of the bytecode back to original source form (dynamic approaches). The tool I created, Virtual Deobfuscator, will require no static man-hours reversing for the bytecode location or how the VM interpreter works, and will recreate instructions nearly equivalent to the original instructions. \n \n Presented by Jason Raber \n \n What's on the Wire? Physical Layer Tapping with Project Daisho We believe that flaws in network protocols will not be discovered unless physical layer communication tapping solutions are made available to security researchers. In order to have confidence in our communication media we need the ability to monitor and modify the packets transferred on the wire. 802.11 network monitoring allowed the flaws in WEP and WPA to be exposed, Bluetooth Low Energy monitoring has shown problems in the key exchange protocol, but we are often more trusting of wired connections. Project Daisho is an attempt to fix that trust by allowing researchers to investigate wired protocols using existing software tools wherever possible. Daisho is an open source, extensible, modular network tap for wired communication media such as gigabit Ethernet, HDMI connections, and USB 3.0 connections. All aspects of the project are open source, including the hardware designs, software and FPGA cores. The project is producing the first open source USB 3.0 FPGA core. \n \n What Security Researchers Need to Know About Anti-Hacking Law The federal anti-hacking law, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, is infamous for its broad language and tough penalties, and has been used in recent years to bring heavy-handed charges against targets like Andrew Auernheimer (aka Weev) and Aaron Swartz. This presentation will explain why the CFAA is such a dangerous tool in the hands of overzealous prosecutors. I'll survey some of the legal precedents most relevant to the infosec community, including cases on port scanning, violating website terms of use, and designing tools capable of bypassing technical access controls. I'll also explain the prosecution against Weev in depth and discuss its greater implications for security researchers. Finally, I'll discuss what security professionals can learn from these cases to reduce the potential for legal trouble. \n \n Presented by Marcia Hofmann \n \n With BIGDATA comes BIG responsibility: Practical exploiting of MDX injections Let\u2019s take a look into the place where critical data is stored for further analytics afterwards. It\u2019s Business Warehouse (BW) and Big Data. Classic online transaction processing systems (OLTP) are not quite suitable to process big data, so they were replaced by OLAP with its multi-dimensional structures. This technology is present in almost all Business Intelligence applications including key vendors like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP. All the critical corporate data in one place, well\u2026 isn\u2019t it a sweet target for an attacker? The OLAP technology has brought a lot of new terms and concepts into the world: OLAP cube, measures, dimensions, XMLA, and the MDX language, which is used for requests to multi-dimensional data structures. In today\u2019s Business Intelligence (BI) marketplace, most OLAP servers and almost all BI clients talk in MDX. This talk will describe in detail all the entities of this technology and especially the MDX request language. The talk will also feature an overview of possible MDX-related attacks as well as an overview of code injection, data retrieval and update vectors. Moreover, I will show some examples of the systems that can be exploited by MDX-related vulnerabilities, their system-related differences, post-exploitation vectors, and a cheat-sheet with a tool for simplifying MDX Injections. \n \n ') UNION SELECT `This_Talk` AS ('New Optimization and Obfuscation Techniques\u2019)%00 This talk will present some of the newest and most advanced optimization and obfuscation techniques available in the field of SQL Injections. These techniques can be used to bypass web application firewalls and intrusion detection systems at an alarming speed. This talk will also demonstrate these techniques on both open-source and commercial firewalls and present the ALPHA version of a framework called Leapfrog which Roberto is developing; Leapfrog is designed to assist security professionals, IT administrators, firewall vendors and companies in testing their firewall rules and implementation to determine if they are an adequate enough defense measure to stop a real cyber-attack. Many of the techniques that will be presented were created by Roberto Salgado and are currently some of the fastest methods of extracting information from a database through SQL Injections. Roberto will demonstrate how to reduce the amount of time it takes to exploit a SQL Injection by over a third of the time it would normally take. He will also demonstrate why firewalls and intrusion detection systems are not the ultimate solution to security and why other measurements should also be implemented. \n \n Presented by Roberto Salgado \n \n Workshops \n \n Do-It-Yourself Cellular IDS For less than $500, you can build your own cellular intrusion detection system to detect malicious activity through your own local femtocell. Our team will show how we leveraged root access on a femtocell, reverse engineered the activation process, and turned it into a proof-of-concept cellular network intrusion monitoring system. We leveraged commercial Home Node-Bs (\"femtocells\") to create a 3G cellular network sniffer without needing to reimplement the UMTS or CDMA2000 protocol stacks. Inside a Faraday cage, we connected smartphones to modified femtocells running Linux distributions and redirected traffic to a Snort instance. Then we captured traffic from infected phones and showed how Snort was able to detect and alert upon malicious traffic. We also wrote our own CDMA protocol dissector in order to better analyze CDMA traffic. \n \n Embedded Devices Security and Firmware Reverse Engineering Embedded devices have become the \"usual presence\" in the network of (m)any household(s), SOHO, enterprise or critical infrastructure. The preached Internet of Things promises to \"gazillion\"uple their number and heterogeneity in the next few years. However, embedded devices are becoming lately the \"usual suspects\" in security breaches and security advisories and thus become the \"Achilles' heel\" of one's overall infrastructure security. An important aspect is that embedded devices run on what's commonly known as firmwares. To understand how to secure embedded devices, one needs to understand their firmware and how it works. This workshop aims at presenting a quick-start at how to inspect firmwares and a hands-on presentation with exercises on real firmwares from a security analysis standpoint. \n \n JTAGulator: Assisted discovery of on-chip debug interfaces On-chip debug (OCD) interfaces can provide chip-level control of a target device and are a primary vector used by hackers to extract program code or data, modify memory contents, or affect device operation on-the-fly. Depending on the complexity of the target device, manually locating available OCD connections can be a difficult and time consuming task, sometimes requiring physical destruction or modification of the device. In this session, Joe will introduce the JTAGulator, an open source hardware tool that assists in identifying OCD connections from test points, vias, or component pads. He will discuss traditional hardware reverse engineering methods and prior art in this field, how OCD interfaces work, and how JTAGulator can simplify the task of discovering such interfaces. \n \n Presented by Joe Grand \n \n Methodologies for Hacking Embedded Security Appliances Security appliances, for everything from firewalls to encrypted SAN devices are a dime a dozen these days. Vendors are throwing jargon into everything they possibly can to make the consumer believe they have the top-of-line device, with every possible feature a person could want. Everyone has heard the sales pitches, but does anyone really take the time to verify the claims, or understand how those devices function? We\u2019ll go in-depth on the methods we use in breaking down hardened security appliances for analysis, using real world examples where possible. We hope to point out possible failure points within the construction of a security device, so as to better educate purchasers and producers on why products fail. We\u2019ll analyze methods of key management, cryptographic implementation, system recovery, tamper detection, interfaces, and much more. \n \n Mo Malware Mo Problems - Cuckoo Sandbox to the rescue Cuckoo Sandbox is a widely used open-source project for automated dynamic malware analysis. It takes malicious documents or URLs as input and provides both high-level overview reports as well as detailed API call traces of the activities observed inside a virtual machine. The project was founded by Claudio Guarnieri and is mainly developed by four developers in their free time and during weekends. Cuckoo Sandbox distinguishes from other solutions thanks to its modular design and flexible customization features. Because of this unique emphasis several large IT corporations and security companies run Cuckoo Sandbox to analyze malware samples on a daily basis and it\u2019s often placed alongside with traditional perimeter security products as an added weapon to incident response and security teams\u2019 arsenals. Being open-source, it also empowers independent and academic security researchers to use a full-fledged malware analysis sandbox freely. For the latest available version we saw more than 8000 downloads and a few hundred constantly running deployments with enabled update-checks. This community also contributes to the project in various forms such as setup instructions, code contributions, behavioral signatures, feature requests and usability feedback and is actively engaged in conversations over mailing lists and IRC. The development team already presented about the project and conducted trainings on several occasions. However due to a wealth of new features and increased development effort, the project is growing and becoming more stable and capable in the recent times. For this reason we want to host a workshop that we designed from scratch with a completely new approach. It will showcase the tool, contain several challenging hands-on exercises with interesting malware samples and explain customization possibilities again with examples that attendees can try. Additionally in this presentation we cover our new VM-introspection based analysis module for the first time. We intend to release it as an alternative to our userland hooking based approach in order to evade malware trying to detect us. So in the future, users can use several analysis methods and compare results to pinpoint evasion techniques. The audience can interact and participate to the workshop with just a web browser and an SSH client. \n \n Network Forensics: Sudden Death Workshop Test your Network Forensics-fu in this deadly workshop. Participants will receive a brand new release of the Network Forensics workstation and packet captures containing VoIP, streaming video, IRC traffic, proprietary protocols, TLS-encrypted traffic, Android application traffic, and more. Wireshark won't save you in this battle royale! Competitors will have to: Reverse engineer a proprietary protocol to uncover a secret document \n \n Manually extract a streaming video from a VLC session \n \n Carve a telephone call out of SIP traffic \n \n Crack TLS-encrypted Facebook traffic from a mobile phone session to capture the suspect's location \n \n Beat every other network forensic expert to the solution The fastest network forensics expert wins! Rounds are timed, and the first person to solve each round wins a prize. Solutions will be reviewed during the workshop. You get to keep the evidence and Network Forensic workstation image. \n \n PDF Attack: A Journey from the Exploit Kit to the shellcode PDF Attack: A journey from the Exploit Kit to the shellcode is a workshop to show how to analyze obfuscated Javascript code from an Exploit Kit page, extract the exploits used, and analyze them. Nowadays it is possible to use automated tools to extract URLs and binaries but it is also important to know how to do it manually to not to miss a detail. We will focus on PDF documents mostly, starting from a simple Javascript Hello World document and ending with a real file used by a fresh Exploit Kit. This workshop will also include exercises to modify malicious PDF files and obfuscate them to try to bypass AV software; very useful in pentesting. The latest version of peepdf (included in REMnux, BackTrack and Kali Linux) will be used to accomplish these tasks, so this presentation covers the latest tricks used by cybercriminals like using new filters and encryption to make analysis more difficult. \n \n Presented by Jose Miguel Esparza \n \n Practical Pentesting of ERPs and Business Applications Today, the whole business of a company depends on enterprise business applications. They are big systems that store and process all the critical data of companies. Any information an attacker might want, be it a cybercriminal, industrial spy or competitor, is stored here. This information can include financial, customer or public relations, intellectual property, personally identifiable information, and more. Industrial espionage, sabotage and fraud or insider embezzlement may be very effective if targeted at the victim\u2019s business application and cause significant damage to the business. There are many types of those applications: ERPs, CRMs, SRMs, ESBs. Unfortunately, there is still very little information about the security of those systems, especially how to pentest them. During our work on OWASP-EAS subproject, we gathered top 10 critical areas (similar to most of the business applications), so we will present a solid approach for pentesting those types of systems. We will look at 3 different systems from top business application vendors: SAP, Oracle and Microsoft, and show how to pentest them using our cheatsheets that will be released for BlackHat as well as a free tool: ERPScan Pentesting Tool. \n \n Turbo Talks \n \n Abusing Web APIs Through Scripted Android Applications This will be a presentation focused on abusing web application APIs through the use of associated Android apps. We'll demonstrate using the JVM based scripting language JRuby to load, modify, and run code from targeted APKs in an easily scriptable way. We'll leverage this to demonstrate attacks against web APIs that have reduced their security requirements in order to allow for a more frictionless mobile experience, such as removing the need for captchas, email validation, and other usage restrictions. Building on that, we'll show code building on the existing testing framework of Burp suite and its Ruby interface Buby to make requests to APIs using the functionality we've exposed through the scripting to find differing responses to similar requests, and identifying potential weak points. We'll conclude with several case studies of popular apps demonstrating private key retrieval, arbitrary unlimited account creation on a social network, and locating and using custom cryptographic routines in our own scripts without the need to understand their implementation. \n \n Presented by Daniel Peck \n \n Beyond the Application: Cellular Privacy Regulation Space Aggressive data collection practices by cell providers have sparked new FCC interest in closing regulatory gaps in consumer privacy protection. Tensions exist between consumers and carriers, as well as between regulatory agencies. This talk will explore the current landscape from a technical as well as regulatory perspective and examine how it may change in the near future. \n \n Presented by Christie Dudley \n \n Big Data for Web Application Security The security posture of an application is directly proportional to the amount of information that is known about the application. Although the advantages of analytics from a data science perspective are well known and well documented, the advantages of analytics from a web application security perspective are neither well known nor well documented. How can we, as web application security practitioners, take advantage of big data stacks to improve the security posture of our applications? This talk will dive into the ways that big data analytics can be taken advantage of to create effective defenses for web applications today. We'll outline the fundamental problems that can and should be solved with big data and outline the classes of security mechanisms that simply, based on their nature, cannot be solved with big data. Once an understanding of the domain is established, we'll explore several specific examples that outline how one security team uses big data every day to solve hard, interesting problems and create a safer experience for its users. \n \n Clickjacking Revisited: A Perceptual View of UI Security We revisit UI security attacks (such as clickjacking) from a perceptual perspective and argue that limitations of human perception make UI security difficult to achieve. We develop five novel attacks that go beyond current UI security defenses. Our attacks are powerful with a 100% success rate in one case. However, they only scratch the surface of possible perceptual attacks on UI security. We discuss possible defenses against our perceptual attacks and find that possible defenses either have an unacceptable usability cost or do not provide a comprehensive defense. Finally, we posit that a number of attacks are possible with a more comprehensive study of human perception. \n \n Presented by Devdatta Akhawe \n \n CMX: IEEE Clean File Metadata Exchange False positives are a huge problem in the security space. Organizations can spend more time and engineering on reducing FPs than on detecting new malware. Whitelists can help, but there are difficulties with these. Many organizations will not permit the exchange of files for copyright reasons. 3rd party developers must deal with multiple security vendors to get their software whitelisted. CMX is a system being operated by IEEE. 3rd party software developers can submit metadata for their applications to a single portal. Security vendor subscribers can then pull -- in realtime -- all the metadata being pushed into the system. Since only metadata is being exchanged, there are no copyright problems. This system will greatly simplify the maintenance of global whitelists. \n \n CrowdSource: An Open Source, Crowd Trained Machine Learning Model for Malware Capability Detection Due to the exploding number of unique malware binaries on the Internet and the slow process required for manually analyzing these binaries, security practitioners today have only limited visibility into the functionality implemented by the global population of malware. To date little work has been focused explicitly on quickly and automatically detecting the broad range of high level malware functionality such as the ability of malware to take screenshots, communicate via IRC, or surreptitiously operate users\u2019 webcams. To address this gap, we debut CrowdSource, an open source machine learning based reverse engineering tool. CrowdSource approaches the problem of malware capability identification in a novel way, by training a malware capability detection engine on millions of technical documents from the web. Our intuition for this approach is that malware reverse engineers already rely heavily on the web \u201ccrowd\u201d (performing web searches to discover the purpose of obscure function calls and byte strings, for example), so automated approaches, using the tools of machine learning, should also take advantage of this rich and as of yet untapped data source. As a novel malware capability detection approach, CrowdSource does the following: Generates a list of detected software capabilities for novel malware samples (such as the ability of malware to communicate via a particular protocol, perform a given data exfiltration activity, or load a device driver); Provides traceable output for capability detections by including \u201ccitations\u201d to the web technical documents that detections are based on; Provides probabilistic malware capability detections when appropriate: e.g., system output may read, \u201cgiven the following web documents as evidence, it is 80% likely the sample uses IRC as a C2 channel, and 70% likely that it also encrypts this traffic.\u201d CrowdSource is funded under the DARPA Cyber Fast Track initiative, is being developed by the machine learning and malware analysis group at Invincea Labs and is scheduled for beta, open source release to the security community this October. In this presentation we will give complete details on our algorithm for CrowdSource as it stands, including compelling results that demonstrate that CrowdSource can already rapidly reverse engineer a variety of currently active malware variants. \n \n Presented by Joshua Saxe \n \n Denial of Service as a Service - asymmetrical warfare at its finest Imagine being DDOS'd repeatedly with up to 10Gbps of traffic on a daily basis. Your logs are useless (when your systems are even able to collect data). How do you stop the attacks? Crippling Distributed Denial of Service \u201cAs a Service\u201d or DDoSaaS (tm) attacks can be done with $200 lifetime memberships against the largest organizations around - and almost impossible to stop. Asymmetrical warfare at its finest. The presentation will focus on an investigation that was done in 2013 regarding a large DDOS attack against a regional ISP in Quebec, Canada. The DDOS attack affected tens of thousand of citizens including municipal 911 services (don't ask) to chicken farmers. We'll talk about the investigative techniques (including social engineering) that were used to track down the suspect and the eventual arrest. \n \n Presented by Robert Masse \n \n Denying service to DDOS protection services In this age of cheap and easy DDOS attacks, DDOS protection services promise to go between your server and the Internet to protect you from attackers. Cloud based DDOS protection suffers from several fundamental flaws that will be demonstrated in this talk. This was originally discovered in the process of investigating malicious websites protected by Cloudflare- but the issue also affects a number of other cloud based services including other cloud based anti-DDOS and WAF providers. We have developed a tool \u2013 called No Cloud Allowed \u2013 that will exploit this new cloud security bypass method and unmask a properly configured DDOS protected website. This talk will also discuss other unmasking methods and provide you with an arsenal to audit your cloud based DDOS or WAF protection. \n \n Presented by Allison Nixon \n \n Detecting Vulnerabilities in Virtual Devices Using Conformance Testing -- \"Turning Old Hardware into Gold\" Virtual devices are key building blocks of virtual machines. Any flaws or vulnerabilities in a virtual device directly threaten the security of the whole virtual machine. In this talk, we will present our experience detecting bugs in virtual devices by comparing a virtual device to its physical counterpart. Since the device drivers in a guest operating system assume the virtual devices behave the same as the physical devices, any diverging behavior could potentially cause problems for the device drivers and threaten the security of the guest operating system and the virtual machine platform. We compared the QEMU/KVM virtual implementations of the e1000 and eepro100 to their physical counterparts and found multiple bugs in each, one of which was confirmed to affect guest OS security, leading to CVE-2012-6075. Our talk will cover the basic idea of using virtual and physical device comparison for fuzzing virtual devices, and additionally describe the observability of each device type, methods for capturing device events and states, and methods for comparing between them with only partial state information. We will explain each of these steps using the real examples that led to our discovery of bugs in the e1000 and eepro100 virtual devices. We expect this talk to attract a traditional OS security audience as well as people interested in new testing methods for cloud environments. \n \n Malicious File for Exploiting Forensic Software Commercial forensic software such as EnCase, FTK and X-Ways Forensics adopts the same library component for viewing file content. If the library component is exploitable, lots of forensic investigators are exposed to risks like malware infection and freeze of the software by checking crafted malicious files. This presentation introduces anti-forensic techniques exploiting vulnerabilities of the component embedded in forensic software. Specifically, I show one malicious file can trigger arbitrary code execution on multiple forensic software products. The exploitation has great impact on forensic investigation because most forensic software includes it. The presentation is made up as follows. First, I explain the file viewer component in forensic software and how to fuzz it with a custom script of forensic software, MiniFuzz and a kernel driver for anti-debugging. Next, I describe two vulnerabilities (heap overflow and infinite loop DoS) detected by the fuzzer then demonstrate arbitrary code execution and hang-up of forensic software process using malicious files. I also fill in the gaps on some tricks for exploiting heap overflow (e.g., overwriting function pointers, finding the condition of heap spraying with bitmap images). Finally, I refer to countermeasures. \n \n Mobile Malware: Why the traditional AV paradigm is doomed and how to use physics to detect undesirable routines The traditional Anti-Virus paradigm focuses on signature-based and behavioral detection. These require substantial processing, which hurts the limited power resources of handsets. Also, carriers are reluctant and slow to deliver Firmware Over The Air (FOTA) patches, due to the rigorous testing they need to subject updates to, and the costs of over-the-air updates. A move to cloud-based screening fails to recognize that not all threats will be propagated over the backbone, may obfuscate themselves in transit; or fight back (as rootkits do) to evade reporting or use of techniques such as the \"Google kill switch\". Hardware vendors are evaluating security solutions with hardware support, such as TrustZone, but while this reduces the vulnerabilities, it still exposes an attack surface. Software-based attestation has been proposed by several research groups, based on various techniques that rely on the physics of the device (such as the speed of the bus, etc) to detect undesirable routines. These techniques typically require some hardware support on the devices, though, such as a trustworthy authentication (of the device to an external verifier) and a timer that cannot be manipulated by malware. \n \n New Trends in FastFlux Networks Fast-flux networks has been adopted by attackers for many years. Existing works only focus on characteristics such as the fast changing rate of the IP addresses (e.g. A record) and the name server addresses (NS records); the single flux/double flux structure etc. In this work, we track and analyze over 200 fast-flux domains and we discovered that the features of the fast-flux networks have shifted. More specifically, we discovered that the change rate of the IP addresses and name server addresses are slower than before, in some cases even slower than some benign applications that leverage fast-flux alike techniques. We also discovered that IP addresses and name servers are shared among different families of fast-flux domains indicating that there is a well-established under-ground economic model for the use of fast-flux network. Moreover, we also noticed that instead of single or double flux, current fast-flux domains exhibits \u201cn-levels\u201d of flux behavior, i.e., there appears to be \u201cn\u201d levels of name servers in the DNS system for fast-flux domains. Finally, we also studied the benign applications that look alike fast-flux domains but not. In light of these new characteristics, we proposed several new detection approaches that capture the discoveries about the new features of fast-flux domains. \n \n OPSEC failures of spies The CIA is no more technologically sophisticated than your average American, and as a result, has suffered serious and embarrassing operational failures. This is a rare peek inside the CIA's intelligence gathering operations and the stunning lack of expertise they can bring to the job. In 2005, news organizations around the world reported that an Italian court had signed arrest warrants for 26 Americans in connection with an extraordinary rendition of a Muslim cleric. At the heart of the case was the stunning lack of OPSEC the team of spies used while they surveilled and then snatched their target off the streets of Milan. The incident, known as the Italian Job inside the CIA, became an international scandal and caused global outrage. What very few people ever understood was that the CIA's top spies were laughably uneducated about cell phone technology and ignorant of the electronic fingerprints left behind. The story would be startling, though old, if not for the fact that eight years after the debacle in Milan, history repeated itself. In 2011, an entire CIA network of Lebanese informants was busted by Hezbollah. The reason: cell phone OPSEC failures. After receiving a warning from Mossad, who had lost their network a year earlier the same way, the CIA dismissed Hezbollah's ability to run analytic software on raw cell phone traffic. But they did. And with a little effort, the CIA's network of spies, as well as their own officers, were identified one by one. This is the true story of American Intelligence's Keystone Kops. \n \n Presented by Matthew Cole \n \n Password Hashing: the Future is Now Passwords are hashed everywhere: operating systems, smartphones, web services, disk encryption tools, SSH private keys, etc. Hashing passwords mitigates the impact of a compromised database by forcing attackers to bruteforce passwords. Bruteforce is easier when the hash function is not \"salted\", fast to evaluate, and easy to implement as multiple parallel instances on GPUs or multi-core systems. However existing solutions are not satisfactory, and the huge majority of systems rely on weak hashes (eg. leaks from Sony, LinkedIn, or more recently Evernote). After a brief introduction of the problem and previous solution attempts, this talk presents a roadmap towards new improved hashing methods, as desired by a number of parties (from industry and standardization organizations). First, we'll enumerate the technical challenges for software and security engineers as well as cryptographers and attackers, discussion questions like: why, counter-intuitively, parallelism is desirable? How can complexity theory benefit password hashing? How to define a metric that encompasses performance on GPUs and ASICs? Should hashing be performed by the client, server, or both? What about DoS induced by slow hashing? etc. Then we'll describe the initiative that motivated this talk: the Password Hashing Competition (PHC), a project similar to the pure-cryptography competitions AES, eSTREAM, or SHA-3, but focused on the password hashing problem: the PHC gathers the leading experts from the password cracking scene as well as cryptographers and software engineers from academia, industry, as well as NIST, to develop the hashing methods of the future. \n \n Presented by Jean-Philippe Aumasson \n \n Shattering Illusions in Lock-Free Worlds: Compiler/Hardware Behaviors in OSes and VMs Memory access operations in OSes, VMs or traditional applications from different threads and processes can lead to various security issues depending on the compiler/hardware - especially in non-blocking code. Compilers/hardware pretend to provide sequential order execution, and this illusion does hold for single-threaded code. However, they are not aware of which memory locations are shared and developers oftentimes make the wrong assumptions about memory models. It can be subtle to protect these memory sections from aggressive read/write re-ordering and various optimizations depending on the compiler on x86, x86-64 or the loosely ordered IA64, ARM CPUs as well as GPUs - and it can easily lead to \"losing the illusion\" of sequential consistency. I will discuss common issues depending on the hardware and compiler used, mostly related to loosely ordered hardware and the C/C++11 memory models, but will also compare how they hold in higher level languages. Developers will better understand how these issues can be mitigated and researchers will be able to find them more easily. \n \n Presented by Marc Blanchou \n \n TOR... ALL-THE-THINGS! The global Tor network and its routing protocols provide an excellent framework for online anonymity. However, the selection of Tor-friendly software for Windows currently sucks. Want to anonymously browse the web? You\u2019re stuck with Firefox, and don\u2019t even think about trying to anonymously use Flash. Want to dynamically analyze malware without letting the C2 server know your home IP address? You\u2019re outta luck. Want to anonymously use any program that doesn\u2019t natively support SOCKS or HTTP proxying? Not gonna happen. While some solutions currently exist for generically rerouting traffic through Tor, these solutions either don\u2019t support Windows or require an additional network gateway device. This talk presents a new tool to securely, anonymously, and transparently route all TCP/IP and DNS traffic through Tor, regardless of the client software, and without relying on VPNs or additional hardware or virtual machines. Black Hat 2013 will mark the release of this new Tor tool -- Tortilla! \n \n Presented by Jason Geffner \n \n Truncating TLS Connections to Violate Beliefs in Web Applications We identify logical web application flaws which can be exploited by TLS truncation attacks to desynchronize the user- and server-perspective of an application's state. It follows immediately that servers may make false assumptions about users, hence, the flaw constitutes a security vulnerability. Moreover, in the context of authentication systems, we exploit the vulnerability to launch the following practical attacks: we exploit the Helios electronic voting system to cast votes on behalf of honest voters, take full control of Microsoft Live accounts, and gain temporary access to Google accounts. \n \n Untwining Twine Over 14 years ago, Kevin Ashton was the first to coin the term \"internet of things,\" and pointed out that data on the Internet is mostly created by humans. Things have changed considerably since 1999 - Lou Bega's Mambo No. 5 is no longer on the radio, many appliances ship with embedded systems that can be remotely monitored, and the smart home is something we're all excited for and terrified of. Twine is a consumer device that provides remote environmental monitoring through a variety of sensors, such as moisture, temperature, vibration, etc... We will discuss our analysis of Twine, and will lead you through the steps taken to understand what's going on under the hood of a \"black box\" device. The audience will be introduced to the challenges faced, and to the different approaches that can be leveraged to understand (and exploit!) embedded devices (the fridge that tweets and similar devices). Topics include: capturing traffic on a non-proxy aware device, obtaining and reverse engineering the firmware, analyzing opaque binary traffic, emulating a Twine device and gaining console access via the debug serial port. ||||| Security researcher Barnaby Jack on Wednesday showed how easy it can be to trigger a waterfall of cash from a standard bank ATM using readily-available software applications. \n \n In a presentation at the Black Hat USA 2010 conference in Las Vegas, Jack, director of research at IOActive, a Seattle-based security consulting company, used software to trick two standard ATMs into spitting out wads of cash while displaying \"jackpot\" on the screens. \n \n According to a Wednesday report from Venturebeat, Jack was able to hack two ATMs built around the Windows CE operating system and either ARM or XScale processors. \n \n He did so by using a common universal key and a USB stick to load a rootkit software application, along with another program to take over the ATMs. Jack claims to have hacked at least four different ATM machines, a couple of which have since been patched, VentureBeat said. \n \n Jack also disclosed a couple of easy countermeasures to his hack, including physical locks with unique keys on the ATMs to stop thieves from easily accessing the machines. Vendors should also use a trusted software environment to prevent software hacks, VentureBeat said. \n \n In Jack's description of his presentation on the Black Hat 2010 Website, he says he was originally scheduled to give his ATM hacking demo last year, but the talk was pulled at the last minute \"due to circumstances beyond my control.\" \n \n Jack also notes that most ATM attacks depend on external devices to skim data from customers' ATM cards, or on physically removing the ATMs to steal the cash, and that attacking the ATM software is rare. \n \n However, Jack noted that this scenario was featured in one of Hollywood's most famous films. \n \n \"I've always liked the scene in Terminator 2 where John Connor walks up to an ATM, interfaces his Atari to the card reader and retrieves cash from the machine. I think I've got that kid beat,\" he wrote. ||||| BOSTON Barnaby Jack, a celebrated computer hacker who forced bank ATMs to spit out cash and sparked safety improvements in medical devices, died in San Francisco, a week before he was due to make a high-profile presentation at a hacking conference. \n \n The New Zealand-born Jack, 35, was found dead on Thursday evening by \"a loved one\" at an apartment in San Francisco's Nob Hill neighborhood, according to a police spokesman. He would not say what caused Jack's death but said police had ruled out foul play. \n \n The San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said it was conducting an autopsy, although it could be a month before the cause of death is determined. \n \n Jack was one of the world's most prominent \"white hat\" hackers - those who use their technical skills to find security holes before criminals can exploit them. \n \n His genius was finding bugs in the tiny computers embedded in equipment, such as medical devices and cash machines. He often received standing ovations at conferences for his creativity and showmanship while his research forced equipment makers to fix bugs in their software. \n \n Jack had planned to demonstrate his techniques to hack into pacemakers and implanted defibrillators at the Black Hat hackers convention in Las Vegas next Thursday. He told Reuters last week that he could kill a man from 30 feet away by attacking an implanted heart device. \n \n \"He was passionate about finding security bugs before the bad guys,\" said long-time security industry executive Stuart McClure, who gave Jack one of his first jobs and also had worked with him at Intel Inc's McAfee, the computer security company. \n \n \"He was one of those people who was put on this earth to find vulnerabilities that can be exploited in a malicious way to hurt people,\" McClure said. \n \n Jack became one of the world's most famous hackers after a 2010 demonstration of \"Jackpotting\" - getting ATMs to spew out bills. (reut.rs/gIGXVq) A clip of his presentation has been viewed more than 2.6 million times on YouTube. \n \n Two years ago, Jack turned his attention to medical devices, while working on a team at McAfee that engineered methods for attacking insulin pumps. Their research prompted medical device maker Medtronic Inc to revamp the way it designs its products. (reut.rs/sM9mTE) \n \n The U.S. government also noticed Jack's work. \n \n \"The work that Barnaby Jack and others have done to highlight some of these vulnerabilities has contributed importantly to progress in the field,\" said William Maisel, deputy director for science at the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. \n \n Jack's passion for hacking sometimes got him into trouble. \n \n In 2012, he connected his laptop to a gold bullion dispensing machine at a casino in Abu Dhabi, according to fellow hacker Tiffany Strauchs Rad. She said Jack had permission from a hotel manager to hack the machine but security intervened. \n \n It turned out the hotel did not actually own the gold machine and the American Embassy had to be called in to help resolve the misunderstanding, Rad said. \n \n \"He would hack everything he touched, she said. \n \n \"BELOVED PIRATE\" \n \n Jack's most recent employer, the cyber security consulting firm IOActive Inc, said on its Twitter account: \"Lost but never forgotten our beloved pirate, Barnaby Jack has passed.\" \n \n Jack had been scheduled to present his research on heart devices at Black Hat on August 1. Last week, Jack told Reuters he had devised a way to hack into a wireless communications system that linked implanted pacemakers and defibrillators with bedside monitors that gather information about their operations. \n \n \"I'm sure there could be lethal consequences,\" Jack said in a phone interview. \n \n He declined to name the manufacturer of the device but said he was working with that company to figure out how to prevent malicious attacks on heart patients. \n \n Jack's sudden death drew responses from the hacking community reminiscent of those that followed the suicide of hacker activist Aaron Swartz in January. \n \n Dan Kaminsky, a well-known hacker, described the death as a tragedy. \"Barnaby was one of the most creative, energetic, diverse researchers in our field,\" he said. \n \n \"You'll be missed, bro,\" tweeted another well-known hacker Dino Dai Zovi. \n \n Jack's sister, Amberleigh Jack, who lives in New Zealand, told Reuters her brother was 35 years old. She declined to comment further, saying she needed time to grieve. \n \n Black Hat said that it will not replace Jack's session at the conference, saying the hour would be left vacant for conference attendees to commemorate his life and work. \n \n (Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Tiffany Wu, Vicki Allen and Bill Trott) ||||| Well-known hacker Barnaby Jack has died in San Francisco, a week before he was due to show off techniques for attacking implanted heart devices that he said could kill a man from 30 feet away. \n \n The San Francisco Medical Examiner's office said he died in the city on Thursday. It gave no details. \n \n Jack, a security expert, became one of the most famous hackers on the planet after a 2010 demonstration in which he forced ATMs to spit out cash, dubbed \"Jackpotting.\" \n \n According to the Black Hat website, Jack was to present Aug. 3-4 on \"Hacking Humans.\" \n \n \"I will discuss how these devices operate and communicate and the security shortcomings of the current protocols. Our internal research software will be revealed that utilizes a common bedside transmitter to scan for, and interrogate individual medical implants,\" according to promotional material for the event. \n \n The hacking community expressed shock as the news of his death spread via Twitter early on Friday. \n \n \"Wow ... Speechless,\" Tweeted mobile phone hacker Tyler Shields. \n \n Jack's most recent employer, the cyber security consulting firm IOActive Inc, said in a Tweet: \"Lost but never forgotten our beloved pirate, Barnaby Jack has passed.\" \n \n Jack's genius was finding bugs in the tiny computers that are embedded in equipment such as medical devices and banking machines. He received standing ovations at hacking conventions for his creativity and showmanship. \n \n \"You grimy bastard. I was just talking up about your awesome work last night,\" Tweeted Dino Dai Zovi, a hacker known for his skill at finding bugs in Apple products. \"You'll be missed, bro.\" \n \n Friends and fans alike Tweeted memorials to Jack's Twitter handle, @barnaby_jack. \n \n Dan Kaminsky, an expert in Internet security, Tweeted that he had hoped the news of Jack's death was a prank: \"God, the stories. Nobody caused such hilarious trouble like @barnaby_jack.\" \n \n While Jack's attacks on ATMs brought him the most attention, his work on medical devices may have a much broader impact. \n \n Two years ago, while working at McAfee, he engineered methods for attacking insulin pumps that prompted medical device maker Medtronic Inc to bring in outside security firms and revamp the way it designs its products. \n \n He followed that up with the work on heart devices that he was due to present at Black Hat next week -- his first presentation at the annual convention since 2010. This year's Black Hat conference starts tomorrow in Las Vegas. \n \n Jack told Reuters in an interview last week that he had devised a way to attack heart patients by hacking into a wireless communications system that links implanted pacemakers and defibrillators with bedside monitors that gather information about their operations. \n \n \"I'm sure there could be lethal consequences,\" he said. \n \n Reuters ||||| Barnaby Jack, a prominent white hat hacker and embedded systems expert with a penchant for pulling off spectacular hacks of devices at conferences globally, has died just days before a scheduled presentation at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas. \n \n Jack most recently was the director of embedded security research at IOActive. He had worked in the security industry for more than a decade, serving in various roles at McAfee, Juniper Networks, eEye digital Security and FoundStone. \n \n Reached by phone, IOActive's Gunter Ollmann said he was unprepared to speak publicly about the researcher. A message on Twitter from IOActive praised Jack for his research over the last decade. \n \n [Related: Black Hat 2013: 5 Cool Hacking Tools To Check Out] \n \n \"Lost but never forgotten our beloved pirate, Barnaby Jack has passed. He was a master hacker and dear friend. Here's to you Barnes!,\" the IOActive message read. \n \n Jack was scheduled to give a presentation on the security of wireless implantable medical devices at Black Hat 2013. The demonstration was to show how a bedside transmitter could scan and disrupt the processes of implanted heart devices. Reuters reported that the San Francisco Medical Examiner's office confirmed his death in the city Thursday. It did not elaborate on the cause of death. \n \n The embedded systems expert took the stage at Black Hat in 2010, providing a stunning performance when he exploited weaknesses in widely used models of ATMs, causing them to spit out money on stage at the hacking conference. He also exposed a bogus ATM machine a year earlier at a Las Vegas hotel hosting the DefCon 17 conference. \n \n Jack later turned his focus to hacking automobile systems and electronic medical devices, showing how small systems and components that run critical processes can be used by an attacker to cause serious damage or death. \n \n At Hacker Halted conference in Miami in 2011, Jack showed how he could use a transmitter to interrupt medical insulin pumps. The tiny transmitter had a 300-foot radius and could control just about any embedded medical device, Jack said. \n \n HD Moore, chief research officer at Rapid7 and chief architect of the Metasploit penetration testing framework, said Jack's work had a significant impact, forcing manufacturers to take action. \n \n \"He was one of those rare folks who does a great job with research and working with vendors to get weaknesses fixed,\" Moore said. \"He was willing to go all out on his research the way other folks weren't.\" \n \n Joshua Drake, a senior research scientist at Accuvant, said he remembers spending a lot of time with Jack at Black Hat Abu Dhabi in 2010. \"He's a really fun-loving guy and liked to have a good time and a really sweet guy all around,\" Drake said. \n \n Drake called Jack's research \"noble,\" saying that he chose to go after difficult projects because the outcome could have a major impact on security and safety. Working with embedded systems can be difficult because it's about pulling apart the firmware and digging into closed systems where there isn't much documentation or publicly available source code, Drake said. \n \n \"He realized that medical devices could be an area where he could help improve the situation because people's lives are at stake,\" Drake said. \n \n PUBLISHED JULY 26, 2013",

(Associated Press) \n \n NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) \u2014 After decades of raising alarms about global warming, former Vice President Al Gore is now raising hopes. \n \n As a top-level international climate summit starts later this month in Paris, Gore \u2014 who helped negotiate the 1997 climate treaty that didn't control the problem \u2014 is sure this time will be different. \n \n \"I'm optimistic,\" Gore said in a sit-down interview this week with The Associated Press. \"We're going to win this. We need to win it faster because a lot of damage is being done day by day. We continue to put 110 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere every 24 hours as if it's an open sewer.\" \n \n In 35 minutes, Gore \u2014 portrayed by critics as a preacher of doom and gloom \u2014 uses versions of the words \"optimistic\" or \"hopeful\" or \"positive\" at least 16 times. \n \n Even when he ticks off the alarming impacts of global warming, he finishes with a note of confidence. \n \n \"The number of extremely hot days has multiplied dramatically,\" Gore said. \"The large downpours, floods, mudslides, the deeper and longer droughts, rising sea levels from the melting ice, forest fires, there's a long list of events that people can see and feel viscerally now. Every night on the television news is like a nature hike through the Book of Revelation. \" \n \n But he added: \"Increasingly people are connecting those dots. And even if they don't use the phrase climate crisis or global warming, more and more people are feeling that this is going to have to be addressed.\" \n \n On Friday, Gore will take his mixed message of alarm and hope to Paris, a bit ahead of world leaders. He will host a 24-hour-telethon of sorts from the Eiffel Tower to raise awareness about global warming, featuring Elton John, French President Francois Hollande, actor Jared Leto, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, former United Nations chief Kofi Annan, actor Ryan Reynolds and California Gov. Jerry Brown. \n \n But he said it's no longer just about convincing people to act \u2014 it now makes sense economically, too. He says solar and wind energy is dirt cheap \u2014 even free in Texas at certain hours. Businesses and developing countries are taking climate change seriously, he said. \n \n \"There really is a wave in corporate America moving rapidly toward a low carbon economy,\" Gore said. \n \n Unlike the Kyoto treaty in 1997, which mandated emission cuts for rich nations but not poor, what's likely out of Paris won't require ratification by the U.S. Senate and is based on countries setting their own goals. And that, Gore insisted, is \"more productive.\" \n \n But is Gore, himself? \n \n Dana Fisher, director of the Program for Society and the Environment at the University of Maryland, said Gore's \"role is limited at this point. There was a moment in time when he was pushing a wave of attention.\" But now, she says, she didn't even know that Gore was organizing his Paris telethon. \n \n \"I never thought of him as central person in the climate movement,\" Fisher said. \n \n Gore insists that he is. He said he's trained \"many thousands\" of activists and still consults with leaders in the U.S. and other governments at all levels. He plans to be at the Paris climate talks \"until the last dog dies.\" \n \n Some experts suggest Gore's stint as the public face of climate change activism \u2014 especially with his 2006 documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\" \u2014 may have turned off some people because the messenger was so associated with Democratic politics. \n \n \"Climate change science is demonized because of Al Gore,\" said Erik Conway, a NASA historian who co-wrote the book \"Merchants of Doubt.\" Conway doesn't fault Gore, but said, \"If John McCain had become the titular leader of the climate change movement instead of Al Gore, we might have a different world.\" \n \n But Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard historian who is a co-author of the book with Conway, disagrees. \"He's become demonized because he is effective,\" she said. \n \n For his part, Gore said, \"Whoever becomes highly visible as a spokesman for change gets the slings and arrows and all of the anger directed at the messenger to try to get at the message.\" \n \n In addition to his Climate Reality Project, his main advocacy group (which is co-producing the telethon), Gore is chairman of Generation Investment Management, a boutique investment managing firm. He is on Apple's board of directors and is a senior partner at a Kleiner Parkins Caufield & Byers, a major Silicon Valley venture capital fund. \n \n Fifteen years later, the 67-year-old Gore claims he doesn't dwell on 2000 election, when he won the popular vote but lost the Electoral College: \"I started moving forward the day after the Supreme Court decision and I'm excited about the future.\" \n \n So was losing the presidency was all for the best? \n \n \"No, I wouldn't say that,\" Gore said, laughing. \"I don't think there's any position with as much potential to create positive change as much as president of the U.S., but that was not to be. I feel very fortunate other ways to make a positive difference.\" \n \n Then he returned to the subject of his telethon. Hozier will be among the performers; Gore whips out his iPhone to play the singer's 2014 hit, \"Take Me To Church.\" \n \n He closed his eyes and listened. The song's final verse: \"In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene, only then I am human, only then I am clean.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Online: \n \n Al Gore's Live Earth: 24 Hours of Reality: https://www.climaterealityproject.org/24hoursofreality \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Seth Borenstein at http://twitter.com/borenbears and his work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/content/seth-borenstein ||||| Second round of Live Earth music concerts promised by former US vice-president and Pharrell Williams were due to be broadcasted to billions around the world \n \n Pharrell Williams and Al Gore\u2019s promise of a second round of Live Earth concerts on seven continents that would be broadcast to an audience of billions has been downgraded to a webcast in Paris, organisers have confirmed. \n \n Everything you need to know about the Paris climate summit and UN talks Read more \n \n In January, the duo and producer Kevin Wall used the World Economic Forum in Davos to announce a global event that would reach 2 billion people across 193 television networks, with promotional materials promising 100 artists in seven shows. \n \n In May organisers delayed the event from a scheduled date of 18 June and said a free, public concert would be held in Paris in the autumn instead. \n \n But this week organisers told the Guardian that Live Earth had been reduced to an event on the 13 and 14 November at the Champ de Mars in Paris that will be closed to the public and streamed online instead. \n \n \u201cIt is taking a different form this year than the open concert of years past but some great musical talent has signed on to the 24 Hours event,\u201d said a spokeswoman, referring to an annual 24-hour event held by Gore\u2019s NGO, Climate Reality.

That threshold is estimated as a temperature rise of 2C above pre-industrial levels, and on current emissions trajectories we are heading for a rise of about 5C. That may not sound like much, but the temperature difference between today\u2019s world and the last ice age was about 5C, so seemingly small changes in temperature can mean big differences for the Earth. \n \n Why has nobody thought of getting a global agreement on this before now? \n \n They have: global negotiations on climate change have been carrying on for more than 20 years. The history of climate change goes back much further: in the 19th century, physicists theorised about the role of greenhouse gases, chiefly carbon dioxide, in the atmosphere, and several suggested that the warming effect would increase alongside the levels of these gases in the atmosphere. But this was all theoretical. \n \n Only in the past few decades have scientists begun the measurements necessary to establish a relationship between current carbon levels and temperatures, and the science conducted since then has consistently pointed in one direction: that rising greenhouse gas emissions, arising from our use of fossil fuels and our industries, lead to higher temperatures. \n \n The hottest year ever around the world \u2013 in pictures Read more \n \n Hasn\u2019t global warming stopped? \n \n No. Global temperatures have been on a clear upward path. There was a spike in 1998, after which temperatures were lower \u2013 but still warmer than previous decades \u2013 that led some climate sceptics to claim that the world was cooling. \n \n During the period since 1998, global temperatures have risen at a slower pace than they did in the previous 30 years. That, too, has been seized upon by sceptics as evidence that global warming has \u201cpaused\u201d. \n \n But it is important to note that temperatures have not fallen, or stalled \u2013 they have continued to rise. Given the variations that characterise our weather systems, a period in which the rate of warming slowed is not unexpected. \n \n For the past two years, the rate of warming seems to have accelerated again, but little can be construed from that. \n \n What progress have we seen on a global agreement? \n \n In 1992, governments met in Rio de Janeiro and forged the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That agreement, still in force, bound governments to take action to avoid dangerous climate change, but did not specify what actions. Over the following five years, governments wrangled over what each should do, and what should be the role of developed countries versus poorer nations. \n \n Those years of argument produced, in 1997, the Kyoto protocol. That pact required worldwide cuts in emissions of about 5%, compared with 1990 levels, by 2012, and each developed country was allotted a target on emissions reductions. But developing countries, including China, South Korea, Mexico and other rapidly emerging economies, were given no targets and allowed to increase their emissions at will. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest People sign the Earth pledge made at the the UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in June 1992. Photograph: UN Photo \n \n Al Gore, then US vice-president, signed up to the protocol, but it was quickly apparent that it would never be ratified by the US Congress. Legally, the protocol could not come into force until countries representing 55% of global emissions had ratified it. With the US \u2013 then the world\u2019s biggest emitter \u2013 on the outside, that was not going to happen. \n \n \n \n So for most of the following decade, the Kyoto protocol remained in abeyance and global climate change negotiations ground to a near-halt. But in late 2004, Russia decided to pass the treaty \u2013 unexpectedly, and as part of a move to have its application for World Trade Organisation membership accepted by the European Union. That made up the weight needed, and the protocol finally came into force. \n \n So we had a global agreement? \n \n Not quite. The US, under George W Bush, remained firmly outside Kyoto, so although the UN negotiations carried on year after year, the US negotiators were often in different rooms from the rest of the world. It was clear a new approach was needed that could bring the US in, and encourage the major developing economies \u2013 especially China, now the world\u2019s biggest emitter \u2013 to take on limits to their emissions. \n \n What followed was, agreed at Bali in 2007 after much drama, an action plan that set the world on the course to a new agreement that would take over from Kyoto. \n \n This is taking a long time. What happened next? \n \n It did take a long time. But getting agreement from 196 countries was never going to be easy. The next act of this long-running drama fully demonstrated that: the Copenhagen conference of 2009. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest US president Barack Obama along with European leaders including German chancellor Angela Merkel, centre, attend negotiations on the final night of the Copenhagen UN Climate Change summit in Denmark on 18 December 2009. Photograph: Pool/Getty Images \n \n What happened at Copenhagen? \n \n Everything but the treaty. All of the world\u2019s developed countries and the biggest developing countries agreed \u2013 for the first time \u2013 to limits on their greenhouse gas emissions. This was a landmark, as it meant the world\u2019s biggest emitters were united towards a single goal. \n \n The emissions reductions agreed on were still not enough to meet scientific advice, but they were a big advance on reducing emissions compared with \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. \n \n But what didn\u2019t happen turned out to be the point that NGOs and many in the press seized on. What didn\u2019t happen was a fully articulated and legally binding treaty. \n \n Is that important? \n \n It depends on your viewpoint. The Kyoto protocol was a beautifully written, watertight, fully legally binding international treaty, a sub-treaty of the similarly binding UNFCCC. But it never met its objectives, because it wasn\u2019t ratified by the US, and not by Russia until it was too late. And none of the countries that failed to meet their commitments under Kyoto have been sanctioned. \n \n The Copenhagen agreement, on the other hand, was not fully adopted by the UN in 2009 because of last-minute chaos at the conference, though it was ratified the following year in the form of the Cancun agreements. For this reason, the Copenhagen agreement was derided as a failure by green groups. \n \n But the targets agreed at Copenhagen, in the form of a document signed by world leaders, still stand. \n \n Representatives of governments from more than 190 nations will try to reach an agreement on carbon emissions at the COP 21 Paris climate talks in December. Photograph: COP21 \n \n What is likely to be agreed in Paris? \n \n We know already what the biggest emitters have committed to. The EU will cut its emissions by 40%, compared with 1990 levels, by 2030. The US will cut its emissions by 26% to 28%, compared with 2005 levels, by 2025. China will agree that its emissions will peak by 2030. \n \n Nations responsible for more than 90% of global emissions have now come up with their targets \u2013 known in the UN jargon as Indended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDCs . These include all of the major developed and developing countries, though their contributions vary: in the case of developed countries, actual cuts in emissions, but for developing countries a range of targets including limits on emissions compared to \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d, and pledges to increase low-carbon energy or preserve forests. \n \n Analysis of the INDCS, endorsed by the UN, has suggested that these pledges are enough to hold the world to about 2.7C or 3C of warming. That is not quite enough to meet the scientific advice. However, that is not the end of the story. One of the key components of any Paris agreement would be to institute a system of review of the emissions targets every five years, with a view to ratcheting them upwards. \n \n Another, and complementary, approach is to make more effort to bring down emissions outside the UN process, for instance by engaging \u201cnon-state actors\u201d such as cities, local governments and businesses to do more. \n \n If the commitments from the major countries are in the bag, does that mean the Paris agreement is settled? \n \n Not at all \u2013 the other key question, apart from emissions reductions, is finance. Poorer countries want the rich world to provide them with financial help that will enable them to invest in clean technology to cut their greenhouse gas emissions, and to adapt their infrastructure to the likely damage from climate change. \n \n This is a hugely contentious issue. At Copenhagen, where the finance part of the deal was only sorted out at the very last minute, rich countries agreed to supply $30bn ($20bn) of \u201cfast-start\u201d financial assistance to the poor nations, and they said that by 2020, financial flows of at least $100bn a year would be provided. \n \n As a cornerstone of any Paris agreement, poor countries want assurances that this pledge will be met. That has now been given, in several forms: the OECD issued a report in October showing that two thirds of the finance required is already being supplied; and a report by the World Resources Institute showed that the remainder can be made up by increased finance from the World Bank and other development banks, and from the private sector. The World Bank and several governments have already committed to upping their financial assistance, meaning that a clear path towards the 2020 target can now be discerned. \n \n There is more, however. Poor nations also want a similar provision in place beyond 2020, but there is strong disagreement over how this should be done. Some want all the money to come from rich country governments, but those governments are adamant that they will not provide such funding solely from the public purse. They want international development banks, such as the World Bank, to play a role, and they want most of the funding to come from the private sector. \n \n An agreement on this is still possible, but it will be one of the main obstacles to a Paris deal. \n \n Low targets, goals dropped: Copenhagen ends in failure Read more \n \n Will world leaders go to Paris to agree on this? \n \n Yes. The heads of state or government of more than 130 countries have already said they will come. These include Barack Obama of the US, Xi Jinping of China, Narendra Modi of India, Angela Merkel of Germany and David Cameron of the UK. None have as yet pulled out as a result of the terrorist attacks on Paris, and security has been stepped up as an assurance. Unlike the Copenhagen talks, however, at which world leaders turned up at the last minute of the two weeks of talks to find their negotiating teams in chaos and without a clear agreement for them to sign, this time the leaders will arrive at the beginning of the conference, give their negotiating teams clear instructions, and expect a fully formed agreement at the end of it. \n \n On behalf of the French government, the conference will be led by foreign minister Laurent Fabius, and environment minister Segolene Royal, but the French president Francois Hollande will also play a key role. They are all confident that a deal can be made. \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest French president Francois Hollande. Photograph: Philippe Wojazer /Pool/EPA \n \n What else can we expect before Paris? \n \n The key question now is over security. With the French capital under recent attack, and reports of fresh assaults averted by the armed forces, the atmosphere in Paris will be unlike any city that has hosted major international talks before. Security will be paramount - the French police and army will be on the streets, and the venue will be patrolled by uniformed UN guards - but the atrocities of 13 November will hang heavily on all delegates. This may mean that when world leaders attend private meetings, terrorism is discussed before climate change. But it may also mean that delegates are under more pressure than ever to come up with a deal, given the tragic circumstances surrounding them. \n \n If nations can meet and agree equitable goals on the climate, in these circumstances, it will be a triumph for international cooperation, for our wellbeing and security, and for faith in the future, in the face of forces who wish to destroy all three. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

    "input": "Forces loyal to Col. Moammar Gadhafi pressed their offensive into eastern Libya on Sunday, as an unraveling and demoralized rebel force fled the coastal oil town of Brega and began to lose its grip on power in its de facto capital city of Benghazi. \n \n The battlefield developments lent urgency to an Arab League request Saturday to the United Nations Security Council to enforce a no-fly zone over Libyan airspace that is likely to be taken up this week. \n \n The League's decision was an unprecedented endorsement of military action aimed at an Arab country, but European diplomats said it wouldn't likely suffice to ensure the measure is enacted. \n \n The opposition's armed ragtag volunteer corps continued to lose ground. Rebel officials on Sunday said they have begun rounding up Gadhafi supporters in Benghazi following a string of mysterious explosions, armed robberies and the assassination on Saturday night of a journalist from al-Jazeera, the Arab satellite channel. \n \n In a sign of spreading panic, several international humanitarian groups and news organizations pulled their staff from Benghazi to the city of Tobruq near the Egyptian border, citing concerns that, after taking Brega, government forces might head straight to the frontier. If Mr. Gadhafi's troops succeeded in capturing Tobruq, they would cut off rebels' supply lines from Egypt and any hopes of an unimpeded retreat. \n \n \"There was a lot of speculation: will he try to seal everybody in?\" said Cassandra Nelson of Mercy Corps, one of the aid groups that retreated to Tobruq. \n \n In Tripoli, the spokesman for the Libyan armed forces made a rare appearance, telling foreign journalists the government's forces have routed rebels from areas as far east as the coastal town of Brega. \"The areas have been cleansed,\" the spokesman, Col. Milad Hussein, said. \n \n Col. Hussein said the government had full control of the town of Zawiya, about 30 miles west of Tripoli and the strategic eastern oil-facilities towns of Ras Lanuf and Brega. \n \n Speaking in Benghazi on Sunday, Abdel Fattah Younis, the former Minister of Interior who defected early in the uprising to the rebels' side and is now the rebel military's chief of staff, countered that rebel defeats at Ras Lanuf and Brega were merely tactical withdrawals. \n \n \"Even if our forces have withdrawn a few kilometers, that doesn't mean much in military terms, especially if they are fighting in a semi-desert with little strategic value,\" he said. \n \n Rebel forces are hoping to make a stand against Col. Gadhafi in more built up areas where the government's air and artillery advantage would matter less. In recent weeks the rebels have put up tough fights in urban areas of western Libya, but have proven less effective fighting in open terrain, where they are exposed to airstrikes. \n \n European diplomats said the Arab League decision would turn the international focus back to U.N. deliberations this week. But they said the weight of the message would be softened somewhat by the fact that Libya's neighbors, Algeria and Syria, didn't back the no-fly zone. \n \n Also tempering momentum is the reluctance of most, if not all, Arab countries to go beyond rhetorical, and perhaps some financial, support for United Nation's enforced no-fly zone. \n \n Despite favoring the recommendation that the Security Council enforce a no-fly zone, the Egyptian military, the Arab world's largest, is unlikely to participate in such an operation or to offer strategic support, said analysts. \n \n After assuming power in the wake of President Hosni Mubarak's departure, the armed forces are now more focused on internal affairs of state and will want to avoid the popular stigma of colluding with Western powers to attack a fellow Arab country, observers say. \n \n \"I don't think that the Egyptian armed forces have time now to engage in such outside problems. They are very busy here in Egypt,\" said Mohammed Kadry Said, a retired major general in Egypt's Air Defense Command and the head of security studies at the government-funded Al Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies. \n \n When European Union leaders met Friday to discuss Libya, many, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, showed reluctance to support no-fly-zone proposals being pushed particularly by French President Nicolas Sarkozy. \n \n They agreed to such action only if there was a demonstrable need, a clear legal basis for it and regional Arab support. \n \n At the Security Council, China is still seen as the big stumbling block; its reluctance to give a stamp of approval to any international intervention in a developing nation remains strong. Any move will be further complicated by the fact that China this month holds the rotating seat of Security Council president. \n \n \u2014Yaroslav Trofimov \n \n in Benghazi, \n \n Sam Dagher in Tripoli \n \n and Gerald F.

David said he found something rather surprising on the streets of the Libyan capital: a celebration. \n \n David spoke to one man, who was a Gadhafi supporter. Here's a bit of audio from their exchange; note that we'll add David's whole piece later: \n \n David Greene From Tripoli \n \n David said his movements have been heavily controlled by the government. In fact, he says, on two occasions, Libyan officials showed him Libyan state news and emphasized that the uprising was being led by Al-Qaida. David says that every once in a while he'll hear a PA announcement at his hotel calling on all journalists to get on the bus, because there's a story they want them to cover. \n \n David told Robert that it's been hard to get a real handle on what the mood is really like in the capital city. \n \n Elsewhere in Libya, however, the violence has continued. The New York Times reports that Pro-Gadhafi forces launched fresh air attacks on Benghazi, which has become a home base for rebels. The government also offered amnesty to rebels who gave up their weapons. \n \n The paper talks to a resident of Zawarah, which has been overtaken by the Gadhafi regime: \n \n \"We know what happened in Zawiyah, and we think that the same thing is going to happen here soon,\" one resident said, speaking anonymously to protect himself and his family from retribution. \"They say that if you take down the flag, we will let you live,\" he added. \"Maybe we will fight, but we will have a lot of casualties.\" \n \n All of this is happening as the international community weighs its options. British Prime Minister David Cameron issued his strongest statements yet. Speaking to the British House of Commons, this afternoon, he said he wanted Britain to be involved in military action in Libya. \n \n The Guardian reports: \n \n He said that setting up a no-fly zone was \"perfectly practical and deliverable\" and that action would have to take place soon. \"Time could be relatively short,\" he said. \"To those who say it is nothing to do with us, I would simply respond: Do we want a situation where a failed pariah state festers on Europe's southern border, potentially threatening our security, pushing people across the Mediterranean and creating a more dangerous and uncertain world for Britain and for all our allies as well as for the people of Libya?\" \n \n The United Nations Security Council met today about establishing a no-fly zone over Libya, but nothing was decided. Russian envoy Vitaly Churkin expressed strong reservations. The AFP reports: \n \n As far as we are concerned there are some fundamental questions that need to be answered,\" Churkin told reporters as he left the Security Council talks. \"If there is a no-fly zone, who is going to implement the no-fly zone? How the no-fly zone is going to be implemented?\" he asked. \"We have not had enough information. To say 'we need to act quickly,' 'as fast as possible' but not to provide the fundamental answers to those fundamental questions, to us is not really helping. It is just beating the air.\" \n \n The French ambassador said the no-fly zone was still on the table and a decision could come later this week. \n \n Update at 6:08 p.m. ET: As Korva reported earlier, the Group of Eight leading economies was also meeting in Paris tonight. \n \n Quoting Italy's foreign minister, the AP reports that the group came to no agreement about a no-fly zone over Libya. Franco Frattini told reporters that France and Britain favor a no-fly zone but Russia and Germany are \"reluctant to approve\" one. \n \n Secretary of State Hilary Clinton was also there for the two-day meeting. \n \n Update at 7:26 p.m. ET: NPR's David Welna reports that the Senate passed a non-binding resolution calling for the U.S. to recognize the provisional revolutionary government in Eastern Libya and establishing a no-fly zone over the country. \n \n The Hill reports that Sen.

At the same time, loyalist forces gained ground militarily, pushing rebels out of the coastal oil town of Brega, according to the Wall Street Journal. There were also a series of mysterious explosions in Benghazi, along with some robberies and the murder of an al-Jazeera journalist, prompting rebel authorities to round up Gadhafi supporters."

Another person said the president was primarily focused on the Homeland Security Department because he viewed Ms. Nielsen as primarily responsible for keeping illegal immigrants out of the country. \n \n During the meeting, Mr. Trump yelled about the United States\u2019 porous border and said more needed to be done to fix it. When members of his cabinet pointed out that the country relies on day laborers who cross the border each day, Mr. Trump said that was fine, but continued to complain, one person said. \n \n The president also complained about the continued failure of his administration to find a way to build a wall along the southern border with Mexico, two people familiar with the episode said. \n \n Ms. Nielsen viewed the president\u2019s rant as directed mostly at her, and she told associates after the meeting that she should not continue in the job if he did not view her as effective. One person close to Ms. Nielsen said she was miserable in her job. \n \n Mr. Trump has clashed with Ms. Nielsen for weeks about his belief that more should be done to secure the border. In early April, the president repeatedly expressed frustration with Ms. Nielsen that her department was not doing enough to close loopholes that were allowing illegal immigrants into the country, according to one official familiar with those discussions. \n \n During those discussions, officials had presented Mr. Trump with a list of proposals that would help border agents crack down on those trying to cross the border illegally and send them back more quickly. The president urged Ms. Nielsen to be more aggressive, the official said. \n \n One persistent issue has been Mr. Trump\u2019s belief that Ms. Nielsen and other officials in the department were resisting his direction that parents be separated from their children when families cross illegally into the United States, several officials said. The president and his aides in the White House had been pushing a family separation policy for weeks as a way of deterring families from trying to cross the border illegally. ||||| The @ nytimes article alleging that the Secretary drafted a resignation letter yesterday and was close to resigning is false.

(here) \n \n \"All of the effort is to speed your way through the checkout so that we can reduce costs and improve the shopping experience,\" said Paul Weitzel, managing partner at retail consulting firm Willard Bishop, who said he had not seen Walmart's test. \"With smartphones and improved technology we're only going to see more of this.\" \n \n The test comes months after Walmart said that it would add more self-checkout lanes at its Walmart and Sam's Club stores as it continues to look for ways to lower costs and prices for its shoppers. \n \n Pushing more shoppers to scan their own items and make payments without the help of a cashier could save Walmart millions of dollars, Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said on March 7. The company spends about $12 million in cashier wages every second at its Walmart U.S. stores. \n \n Shoppers often complain on Twitter and in other forums that it takes too long to pay at Walmart, where sometimes only a few of the several checkout lanes are open and staffed with cashiers. While some retailers employ baggers to speed up the checkout process, at Walmart one employee scans and bags items. \n \n \"We're continually testing new and innovative ways to serve customers and enhance the shopping experience in our stores,\" said Walmart spokesman David Tovar. \n \n Walmart's iPhone app already includes functions such as letting shoppers create lists and seeing which items are in stock. \n \n The test comes as retailers and restaurants are trying to figure out ways to speed up the checkout process by letting customers pay with a tap of their smartphones. \n \n In the Walmart iPhone scanning test, shoppers can scan products with their phone and put them in bags while they shop, and then pay at a self-checkout counter. \n \n The test does not allow users to pay on their phone. The app transfers the scanned items to the self-checkout kiosk and then shoppers complete the transaction using the normal self-checkout process. \n \n Walmart declined to give details on where the test might lead, but it could conceivably allow for scanning on other smart phones and be paired with mobile payment. \n \n Walmart earlier this month said it was joining with other retailers to develop a mobile payment network, a retailer-led initiative that would match similar services by Google Inc and eBay Inc, among others. \n \n While self-checkout aisles are common at many stores, the ability to scan items with one's mobile phone while shopping is not a typical process. Among other tests, Supervalu Inc's Jewel-Osco chain once let shoppers use handheld scanners and then enter that information at the checkout to pay, but that test ended years ago. \n \n \"This is probably the fourth technology that we've tried between shopping carts, RFID chips, the handheld scanners and now we've got smartphones,\" Weitzel said of the retail industry. \"We're looking for ways to improve that experience as an industry.\" \n \n Walmart's test appears to be limited to one store, but it appears that the company sought out participants beyond its staff for its study. The company asked employees to reach out to friends and family in its search for participants, according to a copy of an email sent by the company's @WalmartLabs team and obtained by Reuters. A company spokesman would not verify this on Friday afternoon. \n \n Walmart offered participants in one-hour sessions $100 for their time and a $25 gift card to use in the store for purchases, according to the form on the Survey Monkey website. \n \n Walmart shares closed up 35 cents at $72.60 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. \n \n (Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago; editing by Matthew Lewis and Kenneth Barry)",

The system is being tried by employees with iPhones at one store in Arkansas, and there's no word yet when it might be ready for prime time. Walmart has been working for some time to reduce cashier costs. Already 1,600 of Walmart's 4,500 US stores have self-checkout lines.

    "input": "Northwestern football players win pivotal union case. \n \n Northwestern University football players on scholarship are employees of the school and therefore entitled to hold an election to decide whether to unionize, an official of the National Labor Relations Board ruled Wednesday. \n \n The stunning decision, coming after a push by former quarterback Kain Colter backed by organized labor, has the potential to shake up the world of big-time college sports. \n \n The National Collegiate Athletic Association and universities set the rules and cut the lucrative deals with TV networks and sponsors, exerting near total control over the activities of players known as \"student athletes.\" But now those football players, at least at Northwestern, are employees too and may seek collective bargaining status, according to the 24-page ruling by Peter Sung Ohr, the regional director of the NLRB. \n \n Ohr's decision is \"revolutionary for college sports,\" said Robert McCormick, a professor emeritus at the Michigan State University College of Law who focuses on sports and labor law. \n \n Experts said the ruling could have wide impact beyond Northwestern's locker room, potentially influencing other players, schools, and state and federal agencies. For example, McCormick said that if college players demand compensation for injuries suffered during training or a game, Ohr's opinion could raise the question of whether they should be treated as employees under the state Workers' Compensation Act. \n \n The decision also opens the door for athletes with scholarships at public universities to move more quickly to unionize because state labor boards, which govern public universities, usually follow labor law interpretations issued by the NLRB. \n \n There were many questions left unanswered, including whether a union vote among Northwestern players would succeed, but Ohr's decision is preliminary. Northwestern immediately said it will appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and experts anticipate the case ultimately could be heard by the Supreme Court. \n \n \"Northwestern believes strongly that our student-athletes are not employees, but students,\" Northwestern said in a statement. \"Unionization and collective bargaining are not the appropriate methods to address the concerns raised by student-athletes.\" \n \n Northwestern's football players are the first in college sports to seek union representation. Behind the effort is the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, a union funded by Ramogi Huma, a former UCLA linebacker who has become an advocate for players' rights. CAPA is backed by the United Steelworkers, which is covering the group's legal expenses. \n \n \"This is a huge step toward justice for college athletes,\" Huma said. \n \n He said the NCAA invented the term \"student-athletes\" 60 years ago in an attempt to prevent students from unionizing. Wednesday's decision, he said, asserts the rights of college athletes under labor law. \n \n The union has said it would seek to negotiate over health and safety issues and does not intend to push for \"pay-for-play\" wages, which are not allowed under regulations issued by the NCAA. \n \n Among its demands, CAPA is seeking financial coverage for former players with sports-related medical expenses, independent concussion experts to be placed on the sidelines during games and the creation of an educational trust fund to help former players graduate. \n \n It also wants players to receive compensation for commercial sponsorships, which it says is consistent with \"evolving\" NCAA regulations. \n \n In siding with the union, Ohr said the football players primarily have an economic relationship with the university, which controls and directs their daily activities and compensates them in the form of scholarships, which are worth about $76,000 per academic year if the player enrolls in summer classes. \n \n \"The record makes clear that the employer's scholarship players are identified and recruited in the first instance because of their football prowess and not because of their academic achievement in high school,\" Ohr wrote. \n \n Football players with scholarships, he said, \"fall squarely\" within in the labor law's definition of an employee. Ohr said those players spend many more hours on their football duties than on their studies. Furthermore, he said, the players are subject to special rules and policies that do not govern the general student population. \n \n For example, he said, freshmen and sophomore students on scholarships are required to live on campus. Upperclassmen, he added, can live off campus but are required to submit their lease for approval to their coach, Pat Fitzgerald. \n \n \"Even the players' academic lives are controlled as evidenced by the fact that they are required to attend study hall if they fail to maintain a certain grade-point average (GPA) in their classes,\" Ohr wrote. \n \n Northwestern argued that the term \"student athlete\" is still appropriate. \"We believe that participation in athletic events is part of the overall educational experience for those students, not a separate activity.\" ||||| Northwestern football players qualify under federal law as employees of the university and, therefore, can legally form the nation's first college athletes' union, the National Labor Relations Board announced Wednesday. \n \n \u201cWe had both the facts and the law on our side,\u201d Gary Kohlman, the attorney representing the players, said in a telephone interview with Bloomberg News. \n \n It's a stunning ruling, but hardly the final one on the matter. Northwestern has already announced plans to appeal the ruling by National Labor Relations Board regional director Peter Ohr to the full NLRB in Washington, D.C. After that, it probably will go through appellate courts and even the Supreme Court if necessary. \n \n Outgoing Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter was the driving force behind forming the College Athletes Players Assn., which would take the lead of organizing the players if a union is formed. The legal bills have been paid by the United Steelworkers union. \n \n CAPA attorneys have argued college football generates enormous amounts of profit on players' labor, which makes the players employees of the schools. CAPA said scholarships are the equivalent of payment, but not nearly enough. \n \n Northwestern attorneys countered student-athletes shouldn't be categorized with unionized workers such as truck drivers or factory employees. It said scholarships aren't payments, they are grants. \n \n The NCAA is facing increasing pressure, including multiple lawsuits, challenging its classification of athletes as amateurs. The focus of this particular case is for athletes to unionize at private schools because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities. \n \n ALSO: \n \n Severe weather halts Monday practice at Masters \n \n Dogs or 'Cats? NCAA tournament offers surprise finalists \n \n Richard Sherman autographs photo of end zone tip 'Sorry Crabtree' \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| CHICAGO (AP) \u2014 In a stunning ruling that could revolutionize college sports, a federal agency said Wednesday that football players at Northwestern University can create the nation's first union of college athletes. \n \n FILE - In this Jan. 28, 2014, file photo, Northwestern quarterback Kain Colter, right, speaks while College Athletes Players Association President Ramogi Huma listens during a news conference in Chicago.... (Associated Press) \n \n The decision by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board means it agrees football players at the Big Ten school qualify as employees under federal law and therefore can legally unionize. \n \n \"Based on the entire record in this case, I find that the Employer's football players who receive scholarships fall squarely within (federal labor law's) broad definition of 'employee,\" Peter Sung Ohr, the NLRB regional director, said in his 24-page decision. \n \n An employee is generally regarded by law as someone who receives compensation for a service and is under the direct control of managers. Players argued that their scholarships are compensation and coaches are their managers. \n \n The Evanston, Ill-based university argued college athletes, as students, don't fit in the same category as factory workers, truck drivers and other unionized workers. Immediately after the ruling, the school announced it plans to appeal to labor authorities in Washington, D.C. \n \n Alan Cubbage, Northwestern's vice president for university relations, said in a statement that while the school respects \"the NLRB process and the regional director's opinion, we disagree with it.\" \n \n The specific goals of the College Athletes Players Association, or CAPA, which would take the lead in organizing the players, include guaranteeing coverage of sports-related medical expenses for current and former players, ensuring better procedures to reduce head injuries and potentially letting players pursue commercial sponsorships. \n \n But critics have argued that giving college athletes employee status and allowing them to unionize could hurt college sports in numerous ways, including by raising the prospects of strikes by disgruntled players or lockouts by athletic departments. \n \n For now, the push is to unionize athletes at private schools, such as Northwestern, because the federal labor agency does not have jurisdiction over public universities. \n \n Outgoing Wildcats quarterback Kain Colter took a leading role in establishing CAPA. The United Steelworkers union has been footing the legal bills. \n \n Colter, whose eligibility has been exhausted and who has entered the NFL draft, said nearly all of the 85 scholarship players on the Wildcats roster backed the union bid, though only he expressed his support publicly. \n \n CAPA attorneys argued that college football is, for all practical purposes, a commercial enterprise that relies on players' labor to generate billions of dollars in profits. That, they contend, makes the relationship of schools to players one of employers to employees. \n \n In its endeavor to have college football players be recognized as essential workers, CAPA likened scholarships to employment pay \u2014 too little pay from its point of view. Northwestern balked at that claim, describing scholarship as grants. \n \n The NCAA has been under increasing scrutiny over its amateurism rules and is fighting a class-action federal lawsuit by former players seeking a cut of the billions of dollars earned from live broadcasts, memorabilia sales and video games. Other lawsuits allege the NCAA failed to protect players from debilitating head injuries. \n \n NCAA President Mark Emmert has pushed for a $2,000-per-player stipend to help athletes defray some of expenses. Critics say that isn't nearly enough, considering players help bring in millions of dollars to their schools and conferences. \n \n During the NLRB's five days of hearings in February, Wildcats coach Pat Fitzgerald took the stand for union opponents, and his testimony sometimes was at odds with Colter's. \n \n Colter told the hearing that players' performance on the field was more important to Northwestern than their in-class performance, saying, \"You fulfill the football requirement and, if you can, you fit in academics.\" Asked why Northwestern gave him a scholarship of $75,000 a year, he responded: \"To play football. To perform an athletic service.\" \n \n But Fitzgerald said he tells players academics come first, saying, \"We want them to be the best they can be ... to be a champion in life.\" \n \n An attorney representing the university, Alex Barbour, noted Northwestern has one of the highest graduation rates for college football players in the nation, around 97 percent. Barbour insisted, \"Northwestern is not a football factory.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Michael Tarm at https://twitter.com/mtarm",

How big of a deal is today's ruling by a regional director of the National Labor Relations Board? \"The stunning decision has the potential to alter dramatically the world of big-time college sports,\" writes Alejandra Cancino in the Chicago Tribune. The AP's Michael Tarm uses similar language, calling it a \"stunning ruling that could revolutionize college sports.\" But first things first: The school plans to appeal to the NLRB in Washington, and nothing is expected to change until that decision comes down. Even then, the case could wind up in the Supreme Court. Northwestern's team is the first to seek permission to unionize, and it''s getting help from a players' rights group called the College Athletes Players Association. CAPA, in turn, is getting support from the United Steelworkers union. CAPA's attorneys say that players generate so much money for schools that they are clearly employees, and that they're already getting paid, though not enough, in the form of scholarships. Northwestern's attorneys argued that there's a big distinction between college players and, say, truck drivers, and it called those scholarships not pay but \"grants,\" reports the LA Times. If the NLRB sanctions such unions, expect teams all over to follow suit. Among other things, the unions would likely demand better coverage of medical expenses for current and former players, along with the right to pursue commercial sponsorships."

Even so, many fear the president won't keep his word given his reversals in the past, notably on immigration and healthcare. \n \n The difficulties the administration has had in forging and communicating a policy to respond to the shooting deaths of 17 students and staff members at a Florida high school two weeks ago highlight how, more than a year into his tenure, Trump has been unable to translate his impulses into actual legislative proposals, or stick to positions long enough to do so. ||||| CLOSE Police say a man shot himself in front of the White House.

She will move her production company ShondaLand from its current base at Walt Disney Co.\u2019s ABC Studios to... ||||| Netflix has signed Shonda Rhimes to a multi-year production deal, ending a 15-year relationship with ABC Studios that yielded hits from \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d to \u201cScandal.\u201d \n \n Her shingle, Shondaland, will begin producing new series for Netflix while she continues to stay involved in her current broadcast series. Executive producer Betsy Beers will also come to Netflix with Rhimes, one of the most successful TV producers of the past decade. \n \n \u201cShonda Rhimes is one of the greatest storytellers in the history of television,\u201d said Ted Sarandos, chief content officer, Netflix, in a statement. \u201cHer work is gripping, inventive, pulse-pounding, heart-stopping, taboo-breaking television at its best. I\u2019ve gotten the chance to know Shonda and she\u2019s a true Netflixer at heart \u2014 she loves TV and films, she cares passionately about her work, and she delivers for her audience. We\u2019re so excited to welcome her to Netflix.\u201d \n \n Rhimes has been a consistent supplier of successful dramas for ABC, including most recently \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d and \u201cScandal.\u201d Her first series for ABC, medical drama \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d was a home run out of the gate and is heading in to its 14th season this fall. A \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d spinoff is also in the works. \n \n Netflix is familiar with the Shondaland milieu. The streaming service has long carried older episodes of \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHTGAWM\u201d in the U.S., and in select markets around the world. \n \n The Rhimes pact reflects Netflix\u2019s increasing interest in producing original series the company can own, as well as the arms race continuing to escalate between not only the streaming service and TV networks, but other subscriber VOD options like Amazon Prime and Hulu. Earlier this week, Amazon signed on another proven hitmaker, Robert Kirkman, creator of AMC\u2019s megahit \u201cThe Walking Dead.\u201d \n \n Netflix has been a whirlwind of activity as of late, signing filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen to a deal for a series, \u201cThe Ballad of Buster Scruggs.\u201d The company also just made its first acquisition, Millarworld, which will yield intellectual property from a roster of comics that have yielded movies in the past from \u201cKickass\u201d to the \u201cKingsman\u201d franchise. \n \n The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed Rhimes was earning an estimated $10 million a year under her previous ABC Studios pact. Netflix undoubtedly is paying a premium to Rhimes and in overhead for Shondaland to bring her into the fold under the exclusive deal. The complicated deal is believed to include innovative backend profit definitions for Rhimes to accommodate for the lack of syndication opportunities for programs produced for Netflix\u2019s global platform. The deal was hammered out by Rhimes\u2019 longtime reps at ICM Partners and attorney Michael Gendler. \n \n The deal has been in the works for months. Rhimes\u2019 existing pact with ABC Studios had been set to expire in June 2018. It\u2019s understood that Rhimes let the studio know some time ago that she intended to move on after the deal ended \u2014 not to a direct broadcast competitor but to a new chapter of her career. At that point, discussions ensued to allow Rhimes an early exit from the deal. \n \n The Shondaland operation is expected to remain based out of Sunset Gower Studios in Hollywood, where \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d are shot. \n \n \u201cShondaland\u2019s move to Netflix is the result of a shared plan Ted Sarandos and I built based on my vision for myself as a storyteller and for the evolution of my company,\u201d said Rhimes in a statement. \u201cTed provides a clear, fearless space for creators at Netflix.\u201d \n \n \u201cI am a huge fan of the talented team and amazing programming at Netflix,\u201d said Beers. \u201cThe ability to create content for our new partners is an exciting challenge. I am grateful to everyone at ABC for their continued support and I look forward to beginning this next chapter at Netflix.\u201d \n \n The network and studio arms of ABC issued statements thanking Rhimes for her work for the Disney-owned TV properties, and assuring that the \u201cTGIT\u201d lineup is to continue airing. \u201d I\u2019m proud to have given a home to what have become some of the most celebrated and talked about shows on television,\u201d said ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey. \u201cWith the launch of a new season upon us, fans can rest assured that TGIT remains intact and will be as buzzed about as ever.\u201d \n \n A good deal of Rhimes-related series are still in the pipeline at ABC Studios, which also has numerous overall deals with showrunners associated with her shows. Another Shondaland series, \u201cFor the People,\u201d is expected to bow in the midseason. Rhimes is committed to maintaining her involvement in the \u201cTGIT\u201d series. She\u2019s taking a hands-on role in the final season of \u201cScandal.\u201d She hammered out the roadmap for the Washington, D.C.-based sudser and is said to be penning multiple episodes. \n \n But for Rhimes, the move to Netflix offers a chance to work in a variety of genres and formats that are beyond the scope of broadcast TV. In Netflix\u2019s subscription environment, there\u2019s more creative freedom to produce limited and recurring series of various episode lengths, and there\u2019s flexibility even in the length of each episode. That is attractive to Rhimes. The producer has already proved herself in the broadcast arena, breaking ground with \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHTGAWM\u201d in fielding series with African-American female leads. \n \n The Netflix deal comes just days after ABC\u2019s parent company seemed to have done the streaming service the disservice of opting not to renew Disney and Pixar movies when their licenses expire in 2019. The conglomerate also just announced plans to launch a pair of new streaming services, one from ESPN and another with a mix of Disney-related content that could provide a challenger to Netflix. \n \n But Disney CEO Bob Iger played down the notion of any rivalry between the two companies, noting a range of other pacts that are still in place. Disney and Netflix are also negotiating over the future of films currently on the streaming service from Lucasfilm and Marvel. \n \n Cynthia Littleton contributed to this report.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Netflix has scored a major coup by landing one of the top producers in television. Shonda Rhimes, the force behind such hit series as Grey's Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get Away With Murder, will jump ship from ABC Studios, reports the Wall Street Journal. Under the multi-year deal, Rhimes' production company, ShondaLand, will produce original content for Netflix, though Rhimes will continue to shepherd her ABC series still in production. The deal follows another in which Netflix lured filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen and is another sign that the streaming company thinks its future is in original content, notes Variety. The financial terms weren't disclosed, but Rhimes is believed to have gotten a healthy bump from her current salary of about $10 million a year from ABC."

Web.com locked the domain, and Frydman even roped in the Berkman Klein Center at Harvard Law School to intervene on his behalf. \n \n By September 2017, the Paris Court of Appeals ruled that France.com was violating French trademark law. Armed with this ruling, lawyers representing the French state wrote to Web.com demanding that the domain be handed over. \n \n Finally, on March 12, 2018, Web.com abruptly transferred ownership of the domain to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The company did so without any formal notification to Frydman and no compensation. \n \n \"I'm probably [one of Web.com's] oldest customers,\" Frydman told Ars. \"I've been with them for 24 years... There's never been any cases against France.com, and they just did that without any notice. I've never been treated like that by any company anywhere in the world.

The suit names the French Republic, Atout France (a government tourism agency), the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the minister himself (Jean-Yves Le Drian), and VeriSign as defendants. \n \n None of the defendants has yet made a formal appearance in the Alexandria, Virginia, courtroom. \n \n Web.com, the original registrar, is not a party to the lawsuit. However, the company seems to have taken it upon itself to heed the French legal ruling and give up the France.com domain name without a fight. \n \n As Frydman's civil complaint states: \n \n Prior to the incidents complained of in this lawsuit, Defendants did not object to nor challenge Plaintiff's ownership or use of <France.com>. To the contrary, and as previously demonstrated in Exhibit A, Defendants publicly recognized Plaintiff as a leader in the tourism industry. In 2015, Defendants began expressing an interest in owning the <France.com> domain name and exploiting it for Defendants' own use. Defendants did not approach Plaintiff to purchase or license the domain, the trademark, or Plaintiff's underlying business and goodwill. Instead, in 2015, Defendants misused the French judicial system to seize the domain from Plaintiff without compensation, under the erroneous theory that Defendants were inherently entitled to take the domain because it included the word \"France.\" Defendants knew that they did not, and do not, have a right to the word \"France,\" as evidenced by Defendant Atout France's US Trademark Registration No. 4027580, filed in 2009, in which Defendant expressly disclaimed the exclusive right to the word \"France.\" \n \n The lawsuit accuses France of cybersquatting France.com and \"reverse domain-name hijacking,\" among other allegations. \n \n Web.com's chief legal officer, Matt McClure, did not respond to Ars' request for comment. \n \n \"They claim to be a company that's good for small businesses,\" Frydman said. \"What a joke. They've been absolutely horrible, not even answering our emails.\" ||||| Back in 1994, the year the World Wide Web was actually born, a man by the name of Jean-No\u00ebl Frydman was smart enough to buy a domain that would soon become one of the Internet's most sought-after. \n \n The French expat snapped up France.com from Web.com and set up a \u201cdigital kiosk\u201d website for French speakers in the US. \n \n As the world became increasingly dependent on all things digital, business grew for Frydman, who would regularly be approached by French government institutions to collaborate on campaigns on his coveted website. \n \n However, the relationship had soured by 2015, with France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs launching a lawsuit to expropriate the domain from its owner. \n \n Web.com blocked the transfer but French authorities did not desist. In 2017, Paris's Court of Appeals ruled that France.com was violating French trademark law and by March 2018, Web.com had caved in and abruptly handed over ownership of France.com to the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \n \n \"I've been with them Web.com for 24 years,\u201d Miami-based Frydman told tech news site Ars Technica. \n \n \u201cThere's never been any cases against France.com, and they just did that without any notice. \u201c \n \n On April 19th 2018, Frydman filed a federal lawsuit in Virginia against the French Republic itself, government tourism agency Atout France and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, as well as its head Jean-Yves Le Drian. \n \n He's accusing them of \"abusing the French judicial system to seize the plaintiff's estate without compensation, under the erroneous theory that the Defendants inherently had the right to take the estate because it included the word \"France\"\". \n \n \"The defendants knew that they did not have, and do not have, a right to the word \"France\", as evidenced by the registration of the American brand Atout France under the number 4027580, filed in 2009, in which the defendant expressly waived the exclusive right to the word \"France\". \n \n According to French tech site Siecle Digital, Frydman has a chance of winning the case, in part because at no point before the expropriation did French authorities put in a bid to legitimately buy the domain from him. \n \n Frydman will be using VeriSign as defendants, an Internet company that has full licensing control over .com and .net domains. \n \n None of the defendants has yet made a formal appearance at the US courtroom. \n \n Currently if users type in France.com into their search browser they are redirected to France.fr, France's official brand website. \n \n According to Frydman's LinkedIn profile, \"France.com was a pioneer in the use of the Internet for publication. \n \n \"It was the first company to distribute a daily French national newspaper on the Internet (Le Monde); the first to publish an online travel guide to France; the first to create an online hotel booking engine. \n \n \"Its other early innovations include the first viral success of the French-speaking Internet (Les Webs d'Or), and the world's first hotel comments platform (\u00e0 la TripAdvisor).\" \n \n As a final word of warning Frydman has said: I've never been treated like that by any company anywhere in the world.

But it's an intriguing development.\" \n \n Writing on his blog, Mr Tytelman said that the photos of the wreckage had aroused significant interest on the AvGeek website \u2013 a closed forum for pilots. \n \n He said that there was much discussion over a code part of the wreckage: BB670. \n \n \"The code is not that of a plane number plate, nor that or a serial number on machinery,\" he wrote. \n \n \"But if the flaperon does indeed belong to MH370, it's clear that the reference will be swiftly identified. In a few days we will have a definitive answer.\" ||||| (CNN) Debris found in the western Indian Ocean on Wednesday appears to be part of a Boeing 777, the same model as Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 that disappeared in 2014, according to a source close to the investigation. \n \n The source said there is a unique element to the Boeing 777's flaperon, a wing component, that Boeing observers believe they are seeing in photos. \n \n The debris was found Wednesday off the coast of Reunion Island, a French department in the western Indian Ocean. It is being examined to determine whether it is connected to flight MH370 , a member of the French air force in Reunion said Wednesday. \n \n The debris was found off the coast of St. Andre, a community on the island, according to Adjutant Christian Retournat. \n \n Boeing officials conducted an initial assessment of the debris using photographs. The source stressed the observations are preliminary. \n \n Police carry a piece of debris from an unidentified aircraft found off the coast of Reunion island. \n \n K.S. Narendran, whose wife was on the plane, said he was reticent to call the discovery a major development. \n \n \"I think this is very early days yet. All we know is that a small part has been found. It is still a little early to suggest it does belong to MH370,\" he told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront\" from India. \"I think it is premature to feel that it is all coming to a close or that we are even closer to the truth.\" \n \n Sarah Bajc, whose partner, Philip Wood, was on MH370, said her \"heart has been in my throat for most of the day.\" \n \n During the initial days of the search for the plane, there were several reports of possible debris sightings in the waters closer to where authorities believe the plane went down, but none of those was actual wreckage. Bajc said as an emotional safety mechanism she disbelieves any reports like Wednesday's discovery. \n \n She wants verification, she told \"Anderson Cooper 360\u02da.\" \n \n \"If ultimately this is the piece of the wing, then that little thread of hope that I have been holding on to will, will have to break. And reality will have to take over,\" she said holding back tears. \"But, yeah, up until now, I and most of the family members have continued to believe that until we have a body ... we can't give up hoping they will still come back.\" \n \n If this turns out to be a piece of MH370, it would be the first piece of physical evidence that the plane crashed. \n \n Malaysian team en route \n \n Earlier, Retournat said the debris appeared to be a wing flap and had been taken to the island, about 380 nautical miles off the coast of Madagascar. \n \n The Malaysian government has dispatched a team to Reunion Island to investigate the debris, Malaysian Minister of Transportation Liow Tiong Lai said in New York. \n \n \"We need to verify. We have wreckage found that needs to be further verified before we can further confirm if it belongs to MH370. So we have dispatched a team to investigate on these issues and we hope that we can identify it as soon as possible,\" the minister said. \n \n Malaysia Airlines said it was working with authorities to determine where the part came from. \n \n \"At the moment, it would be too premature for the airline to speculate on the origin of the flaperon,\" the carrier said. \n \n CNN analysts said there are indications the airplane part could be from a Boeing 777, and if that's the case, it's likely from MH370. \n \n Making the determination should be \"very simple\" because the serial numbers riveted to numerous parts of the plane can be linked to not only the plane's model, but also the exact aircraft, said CNN aviation analyst Les Abend, who flew 777s during his 30 years as a pilot. \n \n This means crash investigators may be able to figure it out from photographs of the part, which could be an aileron, a flap or a flaperon, even before arriving on the island, he said. \n \n Several clues \n \n Airplane debris is being examined to see if it's connected to MH370. \n \n There are at least three elements of the discovery that are consistent with MH370, said CNN safety analyst David Soucie. The first is that the part appears to have been torn off the aircraft. \n \n \"This is from a sudden impact, it looks like to me,\" Soucie said. \n \n There also is a seal on the top of the part that \"is consistent with what I would see on an inside flap on a triple 7,\" he said, and the barnacles on the part are consistent with the \"parasitic activity\" that would take place from being underwater so long. \n \n However, the part appears to be coated in white paint, which would run counter to Soucie's other observations in that the 777's parts would be coated in zinc chromate, not paint. Soucie acknowledged, however, that the part could be coated in something from the ocean. \n \n \"If it is a part from a triple 7, we can be fairly confident it is from 370 because there just haven't been that many triple 7 crashes and there haven't been any in this area,\" said CNN aviation analyst Mary Schiavo. \n \n Antoine Forestier, a journalist on the island where the debris was found, said people who were on shore gardening saw the plane part drifting in the ocean. \n \n Reporters from Antenne Reunion looked at the debris, which Forestier said was about 2 meters by 1 meter (6.5 feet by 3 feet). \n \n There was a marking \"BB670\" on the part. \n \n Soucie said he believes the number is a part number, though it might be from a subcontractor. \n \n Drift possibilities \n \n The head of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau, the agency tasked by Malaysia with leading the search for MH370, said the piece of debris is \"not inconsistent\" with drift modeling done by Australian authorities. \n \n \"If there was something from MH370 it could have reached Reunion Island from the area we're covering,\" said ATSB Chief Commissioner Martin Dolan. \"It's not inconsistent with the drift modeling we've done. It's not inconsistent with the search area we're covering.\" \n \n Dolan would not say how likely it was that any debris would move in a westerly direction. \n \n \"There's a range of possibilities,\" he said. \"It's not an exact science.\" Dolan said surface currents, wind direction and how high an object was floating in the water might all play a role. \n \n Photos: The search for MH370 Two years after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 went missing, a relative of one of the passengers burns incense in Beijing on March 8, 2016.

Search teams have been combing a vast area of the seafloor in the southern Indian Ocean, hunting for traces of the passenger jet, about 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometers) from where the debris was found. \n \n Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss told Nine Network Australia that if the debris discovered off Reunion is determined to be from Flight 370, it's \"not really going to be all that helpful in pinpointing precisely where the aircraft is.\" \n \n But he said Thursday that it would provide \"further evidence that we're searching in roughly the right place.\"",
    "reference": "\u2013 Debris has washed up on an island in the Indian Ocean and is raising hopes that the fate of the Malaysian passenger jet that vanished last year might finally be known\u2014though it wouldn't be the first false alarm.

MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, after taking off from Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia with 239 people aboard. It was bound for Beijing, and its disappearance has baffled aviation officials."

    "input": "Published 31 January 2011 \n \n Researchers show how the judicious choice of fluid filler can suppress the turbulent flow that severely hinders the \u201ctop-kill\u201d plugging of a blown-out oil well. \n \n See more in Physics ||||| Could Cornstarch Have Plugged BP's Oil Well? \n \n toggle caption Jonathan Makiri/NPR \n \n While you were thumbing through your Feb. 4 issue of Physical Review Letters, perhaps you noticed the article titled \"Viscoelastic Suppression of Gravity-Driven Counterflow Instability.\" \n \n OK, maybe not. But it was actually worth a look. It turns out the article describes how engineers might have been able to stop the BP blowout in the Gulf of Mexico last year using a child's plaything: oobleck. It's a weird mixture of cornstarch and water. When it moves slowly, it flows like a liquid. Move it fast, and it freezes into a solid. \n \n The idea of using oobleck came to Jonathan Katz, a physics professor at Washington University in St. Louis, last May. He was on a small group of experts that U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu pulled together to advise him about the catastrophe. \n \n So Katz was on hand when BP tried to stop the well by pumping a dense fluid called drilling mud down it \u2014 the so-called top-kill approach. It failed. \n \n \"We'd predicted that [would fail], so we were disappointed like everybody else was, but not enormously surprised,\" Katz says. \"And so I was scratching my head and saying, 'Is there some solution to this problem?' \" \n \n Make Your Own Oobleck Oobleck is remarkably easy to make: Just combine 2 parts cornstarch to 1 part water. Slowly stir in the cornstarch into the water. Mix slowly \u2014 you'll find that the more aggressive the stirring, the harder it is. Add a few drops of food coloring if you wish. \n \n Oobleck Vs. Oil \n \n The problem, as Katz saw it, was that oil and gas blasting up the well tended to break up the drilling mud into fine particles, and a light mist like that ends up getting shot up the pipe and dumped onto the seafloor. \n \n Katz wondered whether there was some kind of fluid that wouldn't immediately be dispersed into tiny particles when it encountered the rapidly flowing oil. \n \n \"I realized after a while that cornstarch suspension \u2014 oobleck, the kids call it \u2014 has this wonderful property that if it's not flowing rapidly, it's a liquid that flows pretty well,\" Katz says. \"But if you try to make it flow rapidly, it suddenly turns stiff and it doesn't flow at all.\" \n \n Oobleck versus a stream of bubbling hot oil? Really? Yep. \n \n \"I made some rough estimates; it looked like it was going to work,\" Katz says. \n \n And Katz had an inside track here \u2014 being on the energy secretary's advisory panel, he participated in daily telephone briefings and frequent e-mail exchanges. He had about as much access as you could hope. \n \n \"So I certainly sent it to everybody on the lists. I don't know who read it \u2014 you can never tell,\" he says. \n \n But Katz was dismissed from the panel shortly thereafter because of some controversial social opinions on his website. Even so, Katz says he still dreamed that his solution could solve the problem and end in triumph. Of course it didn't work out that way. \n \n \"I don't fault the pros,\" he says. \"They have a toolbox; they use the tools in their toolbox. This isn't the place to do physics experiments, especially one that would cost quite a bit of money.\" \n \n Cornstarch is cheap, but the rest of the operation would not be. \n \n \"And of course the drilling mud industry isn't used to mixing cornstarch into their stuff, so it was completely new for them,\" he says. \"It wasn't something they had available in their tanks ready to go. They would have had to prepare a custom solution and take it out to the well.\" \n \n A Pumping Problem \n \n And that was not going to happen. Instead, after BP stopped the well through more conventional means, Katz and some associates at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory did a small-scale experiment with the cornstarch mixture and mineral oil. \n \n They report in that Physical Review Letters article that it performed as Katz had predicted under these highly idealized circumstances. Whether it would have worked in the real world is an open question. Prof. Steve Wereley, who teaches fluid dynamics at Purdue University, says the concept is clever. \n \n \"The problem with using something like cornstarch and water is getting it where it needs to be,\" Wereley says. \n \n You'd have to pump a lot of it, fast, into the well if it's going to work. And there might be trouble pumping it \u2014 remember, oobleck gets stiff when it's put under pressure. \n \n \"It would tend to create that same reaction when you're trying to pump it down the hole.\" \n \n Wereley calculates that you'd have to pump it so slowly that you couldn't get it down the hole faster than the oil was rushing up. And that's a big problem. \n \n A BP spokeswoman told NPR their engineers reviewed the idea and decided it wouldn't work. But Katz still figures it's a good idea worth exploring for the next time an oil well is running completely out of control.",
    "reference": "\u2013 From a month-old copy of Physical Review Letters, NPR stumbled on an article bearing the somewhat impenetrable title, \"Viscoelastic Suppression of Gravity-Driven Counterflow Instability.\" Behind the mouthful was an interesting premise: That the calamitous BP well could have been plugged using oobleck. The combination of two parts cornstarch to one part water, which takes its name from Dr. Seuss's Bartholomew and the Oobleck, is a bizarre substance that flows like a liquid at slow speeds, and turns solid at fast. The idea is the brainchild of physics professor Jonathan Katz, who noted that in the failed top-kill approach, the oil and gas rocketing up the well broke the drilling mud into fine particles. That made him wonder whether there was a fluid that wouldn't share the same fate\u2014and then he thought of oobleck. Katz, who was on the energy secretary's advisory panel, sent out his idea; but he was cut from the panel a short time later due to some controversial social opinions on his website. The report in Physical Review Letters notes that when Katz experimented with the mixture and mineral oil under highly idealized circumstances, it did indeed work. A BP spokeswoman told NPR its engineers decided the idea wouldn't fly, and one professor of fluid dynamics points out another issue: Because oobleck turns into a solid at fast speeds, he calculated that you'd have to pump it so slowly that you couldn't get it down the hole faster than the oil was coming up."

The case highlighted the limits to free expression inside Iran and efforts by authorities to enforce strict interpretations of Islamic norms despite a policy of greater openness being pursued by moderate President Hassan Rouhani. \n \n The 25-year-old woman's brother, Iman Ghavami, said the family had been hoping she would be set free based on time already served since her June arrest. They are still trying to get official details of the verdict, he said. \n \n \"We're disappointed and kind of shocked. We really hoped she'd be released,\" he told The Associated Press. \n \n Ghavami's lawyer, Mahmoud Alizadeh Tabatabaei, said in an interview that a court found her guilty of \"propagating against the ruling system.\" Tabatabaei said he was shown the text of the verdict but is still waiting to receive it officially. \n \n \"I was told at the court today that my client's case has been referred back to the prosecutor because Ghavami is facing new charges. So, the verdict was not given to me,\" he said. \n \n Tabatabaei didn't elaborate what the new charges are or why fresh charges have been raised against his client now. \n \n Ghavami was detained in June at Tehran's Freedom Stadium after trying to attend a men's volleyball match between Iran and Italy. \n \n She is a graduate of the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies and had been volunteering to help street kids in Iran for a few months, her brother said. \n \n Women are banned from attending male-only matches in Iran. Ghavami tried to enter the stadium with other women to protest the ban, according to Amnesty International. Female photographers inside the complex were also ordered to leave, though none was arrested. \n \n Ghavami was held along with the other protesters for a few hours before being released. She was detained again a few days later and stood trial last month. Her brother said she had no access to her lawyer until it came time for her court hearing. \n \n \"This whole case has been full of abnormalities,\" Iman Ghavami said. \n \n Ghavami has been held in solitary confinement for much of her time at Tehran's Evin prison, according to Amnesty. She went on hunger strike at one point last month to protest her detention. \n \n The rights group sharply criticized Sunday's verdict and called Ghavami a prisoner of conscience. \n \n \"It's an outrage that a young woman is being locked up simply for peacefully having her say about how women are discriminated against in Iran,\" Amnesty International UK Director Kate Allen said. \n \n Iman Ghavami said he believes authorities singled out his sister from the other female protesters because she holds both British and Iranian citizenship. Iranian authorities do not recognize dual nationalities for its citizens and treats them as Iranians under law. \n \n The British Foreign Office expressed doubts about the sentence Sunday. \n \n \"We have concerns about the grounds for this prosecution, due process during the trial and Miss Ghavami's treatment whilst in custody,\" it said in a statement. \n \n Iran's moderate President Rouhani has faced resistance from hard-liners who feel he is too soft on those who challenge strict interpretations of Islam. \n \n In one case earlier this year, six young Iranian men and women who shot a video of themselves dancing together and unveiled to Pharrell Williams' \"Happy\" were arrested along with the film's director for allegedly breeching Islamic norms. They received suspended sentences of jail terms and lashes in September. \n \n Iran's judiciary spokesman, Gholam Hossein Mohseni Ejehi, has criticized reports linking Ghavami's arrest to volleyball, saying last month: \"Her case has nothing to do with sports.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers Ali Akbar Dareini in Tehran, Iran, and Danica Kirka in London contributed reporting. \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Adam Schreck on Twitter at www.twitter.com/adamschreck ||||| Since June 2014 my younger sister is in solitary confinement in Tehran. She was arrested for going to a men's volleyball match. \n \n Ghoncheh is a British Iranian dual citizen. She was there to watch a game.

She tried to enter the stadium with other women to protest Iran's ban on women attending male-only matches, and her brother believes she was singled out for harsh treatment because she holds both Iranian and British citizenship. Iran extended a long-standing ban on women attending men's soccer matches to volleyball in 2012, arguing that women needed protection from unruly fans.

    "input": "Sen. Mark Kirk's reference Thursday to an unmarried Senate colleague and presidential candidate as a \"bro with no ho\" is the latest in a string of controversial remarks that figure to make an already challenging 2016 re-election bid even more difficult. \n \n While most of Kirk's verbal gaffes have been made in speeches or interviews, his remark Thursday about South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham was off-the-cuff and presumably meant to be private. Kirk was chatting during a Senate committee vote when his words were picked up by a live microphone. \n \n \"He's a bro with no ho,\" Kirk said, apparently talking to a colleague. \"That's what we'd say on the South Side.\" \n \n The audio was quickly circulated by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and Kirk found himself facing a barrage of criticism over a quip that insulted both women and African-Americans. Kirk's comment is even more politically troublesome because all of his potential Democratic opponents who have either announced or are considering bids are women, and two of them are African-American. \n \n Politico reported that Kirk said he regretted the statement when asked about it. His press secretary, Danielle Varallo, said in an email that \"Senator Kirk was joking with his colleague and immediately apologized to anyone offended by his remark.\" \n \n \"Sen. Kirk said he regrets the comments,\" Graham said in a statement. \" I believe that is the appropriate response.\" \n \n Two announced Democratic candidates for Kirk's Senate seat were less forgiving. \n \n U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth seized on Kirk's comment as a fundraising opportunity in an email sent to supporters by Rep. Jan Schakowsky, who said under Duckworth's letterhead: \"It's beyond inappropriate for a U.S. Senator to make a joke referring to women as 'Hos' \u2014 and it's also reflective of Mark Kirk's broader anti-woman legislative record.\" \n \n Andrea Zopp, a former prosecutor with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, said in a statement that, \"No woman, let alone a woman like me, an African-American and mother of two daughters ... who has spent much of her career overcoming sexist and racist stereotypes would think his remark either appropriate or funny.\" \n \n \"Clueless or reckless?\" Zopp asked. \n \n A third potential opponent is Democratic Rep. Robin Kelly of Matteson, who also is African-American. \n \n Kirk, 55, a North Shore Republican elected to the Senate in 2010, suffered a massive stroke in 2012 and spent almost a year in rehabilitation. \n \n As he tries for a second six-year term in the Senate, Kirk has linked himself to Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner as a financial and political protector. But that relationship can only go so far. Kirk already faced strong head winds in Democratic-dominated Illinois, including the coattails that could be provided if home state favorite Hillary Clinton wins her party's presidential nomination. \n \n Kirk's comment also belie his attempts to sell himself to voters as a socially moderate Republican. \n \n Tim Schneider, Illinois Republican Party chairman, described Kirk's comments as \"unfortunate,\" but said \"you have to consider the context.\" \n \n \"It was meant as an off-the-cuff remark between two colleagues, but \u2026 it was a hot mic,\" Schneider said. \"We know the senator is a great, hardworking advocate for the state of Illinois, and I think we all say something we regret. He regrets it and has apologized.\" \n \n Schneider reaffirmed the state's Republican Party support of Kirk's re-election bid. \n \n In making the \"bro with no ho\" remark, Kirk was playing off recent comments from the South Carolina Republican about how his White House might look. Graham, 59, recently said publicly that his sister could be his first lady, or that one of his many friends could fill in. \"We'll have a rotating first lady,\" Graham said. \n \n Kirk has been dogged by misstatements, exaggerations and controversial comments through much of his public life. Some of the questionable comments came after his 2012 stroke, but not all. \n \n Kirk served in the House for nearly 10 years before beating Democrat Alexi Giannoulias in the contest for the Senate seat in 2010. Leading up to that victory, Kirk exaggerated his military record, his private-sector resume and his political accomplishments, claiming credit for the demise of the so-called Bridge to Nowhere planned for Alaska. \n \n During the Senate campaign, Kirk apologized for inaccurate claims that he had come under enemy fire in Iraq, that he ran the Pentagon war room and that he was the Navy's intelligence officer of the year. It was Kirk's unit that won an award, not him individually. \n \n Kirk retired from the Navy Reserve in May 2013. A 23-year veteran, he served as a naval intelligence officer and attained the rank of commander. \n \n Kirk was criticized in 2013 for his call for the mass arrest of what he called the 18,000-strong Gangster Disciples. He later said he still supported mass arrests of gang members but that he used the 18,000 figure to shock Illinoisans into seeing the full extent of the state's gang issue. \n \n Several months after his Gangster Disciples roundup idea, Kirk described a ride-along with Chicago police Superintendent Garry McCarthy in the Auburn Gresham neighborhood. Kirk said a \"guy got popped\" while they were on patrol. McCarthy later explained that it was a nonfatal, gang-related shooting in which the victim did not cooperate with police. \n \n In another eyebrow-raising remark last December, Kirk reacted to a Senate committee report on harsh CIA interrogations by condemning Democratic committee staffers as \"little zombies\" reaching up from their \"political graves.\" \n \n In an interview this year with the Peoria Journal Star, Kirk said people drive faster through black neighborhoods. \n \n \"With this state and all of its resources, we could sponsor a whole new class of potential innovators like George Washington Carver and eventually have a class of African-American billionaires,\" he told the newspaper. \"That would really adjust income differentials and make the diversity and outcome of the state much better so that the black community is not the one we drive faster through.\" \n \n His office later defended his commitment to African-Americans and said he was combating gang violence, trying to keep assault weapons off the street and working within the black community to find aspiring entrepreneurs. \n \n Kirk also had to clarify his view on climate change after complaining that \"political correctness\" had taken over climate science and misidentifying Leif Eriksson as the discoverer of Greenland. Eriksson's father, Erik Thorvaldsson, founded the first European settlement on Greenland. ||||| Sen. Lindsey Graham says he\u2019s not \u201cdefective\u201d because he\u2019s single. While he\u2019s \u201cbeen close once\u201d to marrying a woman, he\u2019s unsure why he never did so. And he said that if voters want a John F. Kennedy-esque clan in the White House, they should look elsewhere. \n \n \u201cIf you are looking for Camelot, I\u2019m not your guy,\u201d Graham said in an interview. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for glitz and glamour, I\u2019m probably the worst choice in the bunch. If you are looking for a determined person to be president, I think I can fill that bill.\u201d \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Since entering the race for the GOP nomination last week, the 59-year-old Graham has received his share of media coverage over his status as a bachelor, a rarity for a president. His personal life also has been the cause of quips in the back-slapping Senate, with the likes of Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk caught on mic Thursday, referring to Graham as a \u201cbro with no ho.\u201d Graham himself generated a flood of headlines this week when he suggested he would have a \u201crotating first lady\u201d to fill the spot if he became president. \n \n \u201cWell, I\u2019ve got a sister. She could play that role if necessary,\u201d Graham said in an interview with Daily Mail Online published earlier this week. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of friends. We\u2019ll have a rotating first lady.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt was a joke,\u201d Graham told POLITICO. \n \n A single president would be rare but not unprecedented. James Buchanan was a lifelong bachelor and the only president who never married, while Grover Cleveland and Woodrow Wilson married while in office. \n \n Graham\u2019s single status has much to do with his complicated family life, his friends say. As a college student at the University of South Carolina, both of his parents died within 15 months when his sister, Darline, was barely a teenager. He returned home from school on the weekends to take care of her, later becoming his sister\u2019s legal guardian as he entered the Air Force in 1982 so she could receive medical benefits. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve been close once early on, [as I was] taking care of my sister,\u201d Graham said when asked why he never married. \u201cIt\u2019s something I really don\u2019t know the answer to, other than I think it\u2019s OK. At the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing wrong about not being married. Having a marriage and a good family and children is a blessing. But I don\u2019t think I\u2019m a defective person by any means.\u201d \n \n He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in the Constitution that says single people need not apply for president. And if it bothers some people, then they won\u2019t vote for me. I offer what I offer.\u201d \n \n Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Graham\u2019s best friend in the Senate, offered this assessment: \u201cI know he\u2019s dated some attractive women from time to time, but I\u2019ve never seen him get real serious.\u201d \n \n McCain added with a big laugh: \u201cI\u2019ve often told Lindsey that he couldn\u2019t find anybody that loves him as much as he does.\u201d \n \n Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) hugs is sister Darline Graham Nordone on stage as he announces his candidacy for United States President during an outdoor event for supporters on June 1, 2015 in Central, South Carolina. \n \n How voters view a bachelor as a candidate is uncertain. Over the years, polls have shown that fewer U.S. adults are married, a trend that presidential historian Julian Zelizer said could mean \u201cmuch less resistance\u201d these days to a non-traditional candidate. \n \n Not having a wife by his side could also rob Graham of a valuable surrogate on the campaign trail, as his rivals \u2014 like Rand Paul and Hillary Clinton \u2014 dispatch their spouses to rally supporters. But Graham said his sister, Darline Graham Nordone, who works in vocational rehabilitation in South Carolina and has two daughters, would fill that void. \n \n \u201cShe\u2019s played a big role in my life,\u201d Graham said, growing emotional. \u201cYes, she\u2019ll play a big role in the campaign. She\u2019s my No. 1 fan. Of all the things I\u2019m proud of, how she turned out I\u2019m proud of the most.\u201d \n \n Even though he\u2019s single and has no children, Graham says he has close family, including an aunt and uncle who took care of him and his sister after his parents died in the mid-1970s. \n \n \u201cYou can be single and still have family,\u201d Graham said. \u201cI very much have family \u2014 my aunt and uncle, I try to take care of because they took care of me.\u201d \n \n \u201cThere are millions of people who are single. I don\u2019t think they need to answer, \u2018Why are you single?\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cWhat they need to be able to prove is, \u2018Can you do the job?\u2019 \u2026 Again, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything disqualifying about being single. But that will be up to the American people.\u201d ||||| WASHINGTON -- Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) is a \u201cbro with no ho,\u201d according to his colleague, Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.). \n \n The assessment of Graham\u2019s love life was made during a Senate Appropriations Committee markup on Thursday and caught on a live microphone. \n \n Listen to Kirk's comments, which come around 0:26 in the below audio clip: \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve been joking with Lindsey,\u201d Kirk can be heard saying. \u201cDid you see that? He\u2019s going to have a rotating first lady. He\u2019s a bro with no ho.\" \n \n Graham\u2019s bachelorhood has been much-discussed since the launch of his presidential campaign. The senator is single with no children, which has raised questions about whether voters might find him unrelatable. Graham has laughed it off and even joked recently that he\u2019ll have more than one first lady once he gets to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \n \n \"I feel real comfortable with who I am and the life I've lived,\u201d Graham recently told The Huffington Post. \u201cThe last time I checked, I didn't see a sign on the White House that said 'single people need not apply.\u2019\u201d \n \n But while he may lack a \u201cho,\u201d it\u2019s unclear whether Graham would describe himself as a \u201cbro.\u201d \n \n Moreover, Kirk\u2019s comment raises a number of questions: Are congressional bros different from everyday bros? Do they pop the collar on their pinstripe suits as they stroll through Dirksen in boat shoes? Do they hit the Senate gym each morning and play beer pong at Chuck Schumer\u2019s apartment at night? Do they bring red plastic cups onto the Senate floor to sip on vodka-Red Bulls while they wait on roll call votes? \n \n In a comment to HuffPost, Kirk\u2019s office would only say that the senator was \u201cjoking around with his colleagues.\u201d \n \n But even before the publication of this piece, critics were pouncing. \n \n \"I'm outraged,\" said HuffPost\u2019s Laura Bassett, a self-described \"ho with no bro.\" \n \n Want more updates from Sam?

    "input": "Avatar SCIENCE FICTION: United States, 2009 U.S. Release Date: 2009-12-18 Running Length: 2:41 MPAA Classification: PG-13 (Violence, Nudity) Theatrical Aspect Ratio: 1.85:1 Cast: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi, Joel David Moore Director: James Cameron Screenplay: James Cameron Cinematography: Mauro Fiore Music: James Horner U.S. Distributor: 20th Century Fox Subtitles: none \n \n Screened in standard (non-IMAX) digital 3D. \n \n Avatar has been described as a \"game-changer,\" and perhaps it is. I'll leave that for future historians to determine. What I can say with some assuredness is this is the most technically amazing motion picture to have arrived on screens in many years - perhaps since Peter Jackson's The Return of the King. It's also among the most anticipated openings of the decade. Expectations can be a double-edged sword; ask George Lucas. But when a filmmaker meets or exceeds them, the results are tremendous, and that's the case with Avatar. James Cameron has a lot riding on this film, his long-delayed follow-up to Titanic (which came out an even dozen years ago), the all-time box office champion in unadjusted dollars. Under \"normal\" circumstances, at stake would have been only Cameron's reputation and future autonomy with astronomical budgets. But Cameron has hitched his wagon to 3D and declared this to be the wave of the future. Watching Avatar, I can almost believe it. If every filmmaker could do with 3D what Cameron achieves, I'd gladly wear the uncomfortable glasses to every screening. \n \n Avatar is entertainment of the highest order. It's the best movie of 2009. In 3D, it's immersive (that's the buzzword everyone uses for the 3D experience), but the traditional film elements - story, character, editing, theme, emotional resonance, etc. - are presented with sufficient expertise to make even the 2D version an engrossing 2 1/2-hour experience. Despite expending an extraordinary amount of time, money, and effort perfecting the 3D elements, Cameron never lost sight of what's important. His narrative could almost be considered a science fiction version of Dances with Wolves (by way of Surrogates), and it works for many of the reasons Dances worked. Cameron also borrows from his own catalog. The space/military culture is reminiscent of that in Aliens and the cross-cultural romance recalls Titanic. Avatar doesn't have Leonardo DiCaprio but its love story is in some ways more potent than the one told in Titanic because the stakes are higher. From a purely visual perspective, Cameron gives us one of the most amazing presentations ever of an alien world and builds toward an epic clash that may only have been matched twice previously in movie theaters (both times by Peter Jackson). \n \n Avatar takes us to the planet Pandora in the year 2154. Pandora is a jungle world at which Earthmen have arrived with the intention of performing some strip-mining. Although corporations run the show, the military, led by Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), is on hand to provide protection and lend support. The humans' engagements with the indigenous humanoid population, the 10-foot high, blue-skinned Na'vi, have been contentious, bordering on hostile. For a while, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) had some success interacting with the natives by using \"avatars\"(synthetic Na'vi remotely controlled by humans) to provide education and technological advancement, but progress slowed and Grace was closed out of Na'vi society. Now, she and her group of avatars are trying to find a way back in. \n \n That portal comes in the unlikely person of Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paraplegic ex-marine. Sam's journey to Pandora is a fluke. His twin brother, who had trained for years to inhabit an avatar and whose genetic identity was imprinted upon one, died unexpectedly and Jake was the only one who could take his place. He is caught between two masters: Colonel Quartich, who wants the soldier to form a bond with the Na'vi so he can pass back valuable tactical information, and Grace, who wants to rebuild the lines of communication. A series of events in the jungle separate Jake from the other avatars and place him in mortal danger. His life is saved by Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), who distrusts him but believes he is touched by the Na'vi god. She takes him to the \"home tree\" where he must not only plead for his life but for the opportunity to learn their ways. Neytiri becomes his mentor and he soon finds himself more in sympathy with his blue-skinned \"brothers\" than with Colonel Quartich, who is planning a massive operation to relocate the Na'vi away from a rich load of ore. \n \n Most 3D films use the technology as a gimmick - a means to prompt younger audience members to \"ooh\" and \"aah.\" That's not the case here. Cameron's film is immersive because the 3D was ingrained in its cinematic DNA. He has compensated for the pervasive dimness caused by polarized lenses by increasing the brightness (the images look too bright when viewed without the glasses). He has avoided 3D \"tricks\" (throwing things at the audience) that might take the viewer out of the experience. Avatar's visuals are so sumptuous that, perhaps as little as ten minutes into the movie, I forgot I was wearing the glasses. I'm still not as bullish as Cameron about the future of 3D, but I see potential where I had not previously perceived it. \n \n Cameron understands how the pieces of the puzzle need to come together to form a complete motion picture, and he assembles them as only a master can. The story, although simple, resonates deeply at a time when media battles rage about whether or not humanity is destroying itself and its planet. As with Dances with Wolves and The Last Samurai, this is about a military man who finds himself transformed by the culture he adopts and ends up opposing his own people in an impossible battle. Jake's love affair with Neytiri confirms Cameron as being a romantic at heart. The Pandora menagerie is like something out of a dungeon master's wet dream: dinosaur-like creatures that are impervious to bullets, vicious carnivores that make T-Rexes look tame, scavengers that roam and attack in packs, dragon-like flying creatures that populate the skies, and vegetation that's just as alive as the animals. The blue-skinned Na'vi, clearly modeled after the Native Americans, are among the most \"ordinary\" of Pandora's inhabitants. \n \n All movies like this must have a villain; Avatar provides two. The first is the bureaucrat, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), who is devoted to the profit margin above all else. Any resemblance to the Paul Reiser character in Aliens is intentional. Maybe Cameron was thinking of the studio bosses controlling his budget when he created Selfridge. Then there's Colonel Quartich, who is brought brilliantly to life by the scene-stealing performance of Stephen Lang. This man's a real sonofabitch, but it's impossible not to admire him on one level. Like Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now, he loves the smell of napalm in the morning\u2026 at noon, and during the night. Quartich is never CGI animated but he always seems bigger than life. If there's a human star of Avatar, it's Lang. \n \n Lang may have the showiest role but he's not the only actor to do a creditable job. Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver are both solid, even though a good portion of their characters' screen time is animated. Zoe Saldana is even more challenged, since she never appears \"in the flesh.\" Like Andy Serkis' Gollum, she is entirely CGI-rendered, but she accomplished her own motion capture work and provided the voice. Michelle Rodriquez, like Stephen Lang, is never required to become blue. Her role is secondary but unambiguously heroic. Weaver's presence affirms that, as bad as Cameron's reputation as a taskmaster may be, there are actors who appreciate his perfectionist approach. (Others in this group include Michael Biehn, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bill Paxton, and Linda Hamilton.) \n \n After the late summer 20-minute preview of Avatar, there was some unease about the look of the Na'vi. Such concerns are baseless. They can appear opposite humans without the special effects being called into question; we never view them as anything less than three-dimensional. Like Gollum, they transcend their pixel-based conception. We believe them. We accept them. We care about them. That's the key to Avatar being more than a hollow spectacle. In Transformers 2, everything (including the humans) is soulless. Here, there's heart and soul to spare. \n \n Any criticisms I have of Avatar are in the nature of nit-picks, but I will mention them for completeness' sake. At worst, they are ephemeral distractions, easily dismissed. At best, they will not be noticed at all. Sam Worthington's performance is solid but his American accent is not. As was evident in Terminator: Salvation, Worthington's \"American\" sometimes comes with an Aussie twang. Visually, Avatar is almost flawless, but there are some instances when the camera moves so fast that the 3D effect doesn't track well, resulting in a brief moment of disorientation. Finally, although James Horner's score is predominantly effective, there are instances in which he again engages in self-cannibalization. Material sounding a lot like it originated in his often-used Star Trek II and Aliens scores pops up from time-to-time. \n \n Avatar is the most engaging and enthralling motion picture I have experienced this year - and \"experience\" is the appropriate word. There's a rush associated with coming to Pandora; this feels more like an interactive endeavor than a passive one. In addition to being emotionally satisfying and one hell of a wild ride, Avatar boasts a smart script, reminding us that would-be blockbusters don't have to be defined by the imbecility of a Transformers 2 or a 2012. James Cameron has been entertaining movie-goers for more than a quarter century and he is in an elite category of filmmakers who has yet to spawn a dog. For quality like this, I'm willing to wait, although hopefully his next movie will come a little more quickly than the 12 years of Avatar's gestation. \n \n Discuss this topic in the ReelViews Forums. ||||| 20th Century Fox / WETA / Reuters Actors Sam Worthington, left, and Zoe Saldana as Jake and Neytiri in Avatar \n \n In the last shot of Avatar, someone's closed eyes snap open. That's the climax and the message of James Cameron's first fiction feature since 1997's Titanic: Look around! Embrace the movie \u0097 surely the most vivid and convincing creation of a fantasy world ever seen in the history of moving pictures \u0097 as a total sensory, sensuous, sensual experience. The planet Pandora that Cameron and his army of artist-technicians have created \u0097 at a budget believed to be in excess of $300 million \u0097 is a wonder world of flora and fauna: a rain forest (where it hardly ever rains) of gigantic trees and phosphorescent plants, of six-legged flying horses, panther dogs and hammerhead dinosaurs. Living among these creatures is Pandora's humanish tribe, the Na'vi, a lean, 10-ft.-tall, blue-striped people with yellow eyes, or what mankind might have been if it had evolved in harmony with, and not in opposition to, the Edenic environment that gave rise to its birth. (See 10 things you need to know for Avatar's opening day.) \n \n It's the year 2154, and Pandora, a moon of the Alpha Centauri star, is the reluctant host to an expedition of Americans seeking to mine an incredibly valuable rock called unobtainium \u0097 a joke term that was coined in the 1950s and refers to any kind of material that's unavailable or impractical to use, which Cameron employs to locate his movie among science-fiction adventures of the period. The expedition, headed by sleazy entrepreneur Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), includes scientists working for Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver) and a Blackwater-type security force led by the malevolently macho Colonel Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). The scientists have hatched avatars (known as \"dreamwalkers\") that look like Na'vi but blend their DNA with that of humans, who will steer them by remote control. Augustine is entranced by the Na'vi's aristocratic gentility, but to Selfridge and Quaritch they are \"blue monkeys,\" \"savages,\" \"an aboriginal horde.\" Or for want of a better word: disposable. (See the top 10 movies of 2009.) \n \n The new guy in this program is Jake Sully (Sam Worthington, last seen going up against machinery in Terminator Salvation), a paraplegic ex-Marine whose dead identical twin brother had been in the project. Since Sully has the same DNA, he's chosen to man his late brother's avatar. Augustine wants Sully to befriend the Na'vi and help her unearth precious biological samples; Quaritch orders him to become a secret spy, as part of the company's plan to drive the tribe away from a sacred tree, under which can be found vast reserves of unobtainium. In this double role, Sully meets Neyfiri (Zoe Saldana), daughter of the tribal chief. At first suspicious of his motives and contemptuous of his clumsiness \u0097 \"Ignorant, like a child,\" is the way she puts it \u0097 Neyfiri is nevertheless impressed by Sully's adaptability. Somehow he has an affinity for this place, for the Na'vi and for her. Someday he will be their savior. \n \n For me to say that Avatar is better than Titanic is not the highest possible praise. I was no ardent fan of Cameron's grafting of a poor-boy/rich-girl love story onto the true saga of that doomed ship, which set sail from Southampton in 1912. But it was a night to remember for enough moviegoers, becoming the all-time top-grossing film, with a take of just over $1.8 billion (though it ranks sixth in real dollars, after Gone With the Wind, Star Wars, The Sound of Music, E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial and the 1956 version of The Ten Commandments). What Cameron earned from Titanic's enormous success was the cachet (11 Oscars, tying the record with Ben-Hur and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) and cash to make Avatar, which has been called the most expensive picture ever made (though, again in real dollars, that record is probably held by 1963's Cleopatra). That shouldn't matter to viewers. The democratizing principle of the box office is that moviegoers pay the same amount to see Avatar, in its 2-D form, as they do for Paranormal Activity, with its $11,000 budget. The only question they need have is: Is the movie worth it? (See TIME's 2009 holiday movie preview.) \n \n I say yes, for Avatar is a state-of-the-art experience that for years to come will define what movies can achieve, not in duplicating our existence but in confecting new ones. The story may be familiar from countless old movies, from those made out of Hollywood like Dances With Wolves (an American grows sympathetic to the tribes he was meant to annihilate) and Apocalypse Now (and any number of anti-imperialist war epics) to those made abroad, like this year's District 9 (set in South Africa, where a human becomes part-alien and is hunted down by his old own kind). Some of the dialogue in Avatar's opening sequences may be on the starchy side \u0097 Cameron has never been a great director of actors nor sympathetic to their sensitive needs \u0097 but objections shrink to quibbles and then simply disappear in the face of the picture's unprecedented visual flourishes. (Read an interview with Avatar director James Cameron.) \n \n Cameron has devised a romance similar to Titanic's \u0097 a grunt falls in love with a princess \u0097 but this time with far more emotive power. Instead of embracing on a ship's prow, Sully and Neyfiri ride their banshee steeds in ecstatic communion across the Pandoran sky. Think of them as the prince and princess of the world. Worthington \u0097 an Australian actor who had the second lead in the recent Terminator movie \u0097 has little of Titanic lead Leonardo DiCaprio's star power, but the resolve and good nature he radiates make Sully one of those ordinary heroes who rise to extraordinary heights. Saldana, though encased in CGI blue throughout the movie, manages to be the driving force: yet again in a Cameron film, we find a strong woman seeking a man whose strength she can tap. But unlike the tryst between DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, this love affair has consequences. It is not a footnote to history; it makes history, as two species merge to save a planet. (Read \"King of the [Blue] World.\") \n \n And by a planet, Cameron clearly means our planet. Among his activities in the dozen years since Titanic, the director made two underwater documentaries (Ghosts of the Abyss and Aliens of the Deep) that marked him as both an explorer and a conservationist. Avatar brings his social concerns to the surface. This is not only the most elaborate public-service commercial for those of the tree-hugger persuasion; it's also a call to save what we've got, environmentally, and leave indigenous people as they are \u0097 an argument applicable to the attempt of any nation (say, the U.S.) to colonize another land (say, Iraq or Afghanistan). The rooting interest in Avatar is for the Na'vi and against the American ex-soldiers whose job it is to police the planet. When some of them die in the battle that consumes the final third of this 2-hr. 42-min. extravaganza, you're meant to cheer. And you will. (Read about Avatar on Techland.) \n \n That climactic face-off is stage-managed for maximum thrills, as the creatures we met in the first part of the film join the Na'vi in opposing the rotten humans. But the supreme joy of Avatar is in its long central portion: a safari through the luscious landscape of Pandora. After all those years on the water (with Titanic) and underwater (with The Abyss and his two documentaries), Cameron has surfaced to put his vision of Pandora on screen. It's an impossible but completely plausible and seductive world that invites your total immersion. Don't resist it; sink in and fly with it. All Cameron asks is that you open your eyes. \n \n See the Top 10 James Cameron Moments. ||||| Two alternate titles come to mind when watching Avatar, the modest little indie by way of James \"King of the World\" Cameron: How about Runs With Na'vis, or Flies With Banshees? \n \n The filmmaker's epic adventure - which cost upward of $230 million and, actually, happens to be great fun - is the gamer generation's answer to Dances With Wolves. It's a trippy sci-fi tale about an ex-Marine, trained to fight an indigenous people, who comes to understand the tribal culture in ways that make him terribly conflicted about annihilating them. \n \n He falls in love, discovers their spiritual connection to nature, and finds himself at odds with his gung-ho superiors. \n \n In Dances With Wolves (1990), it's Kevin Costner's U.S. Cavalry officer who insinuates himself into the world of the Lakota Sioux. In Avatar, it's Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a member of the \"Jarhead Clan,\" who learns the ways of the Na'vi - a blue-skinned, NBA-tall race of humanoids living in paradise on the planet Pandora. The Na'vi, who resemble buff, pointy-eared runway models, live in a lush rain forest teeming with exotic beasts, including those aforementioned banshees - flying reptile-like creatures that Na'vi warriors must bond with in a rite of passage. \n \n And it's at that point in Cameron's two-hour, 41-minute marvel - when Sully's Na'vi avatar and his female friend Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) take to the air, astride winged banshees - that Cameron's long-borning baby really kicks in. It's like a runner hitting the Zone: All of a sudden, the movie, with its elaborate motion-capture technology (real actors' movements and gestures turned into computer-generated images), breaks into a new dimension - even if you're not watching in 3-D. (Avatar is being released in multiple formats: 3-D, Real-D, IMAX, and lowly, old-fashioned 2-D.) \n \n Set in 2154, Avatar begins with Sully, who is paralyzed from the waist down (there have been military conflagrations in Nigeria and Venezuela, if you're keeping track), set to replace his dead twin brother in an avatar program on faraway Pandora. Climb into a pod, hook up the circuitry, and let your mind and body enter a Na'vi alter ego. \n \n It's a last-ditch effort led by Dr. Grace Augustine (a butt-smokin' Sigourney Weaver) and her group of science nerds to befriend \"the indigenous\" with these human/Na'vi hybrids. If they fail, the private military force led by Col. Miles Quaritch (a cartoonish Stephen Lang), will start killing the Na'vi and defoliating their Eden. \n \n Why? Because they're sitting on mounds of Unobtainium (sounds like something from Rocky and Bullwinkle!) - a mineral vital to Earth's energy needs. Giovanni Ribisi is the squirrelly industrialist overseeing the rape and pillage. \n \n Avatar isn't deep: It has an obvious antiwar, tree-hugging message, and its characters are literally and figuratively archetypes. But Worthington, in both his human and Na'vi incarnations, makes the transition from warmonger to peacenik more than believable. One of Avatar's many brilliant strokes is to have its hero in a wheelchair: When his avatar-self starts running barefoot through the jungles, as agile as a cat, it's exhilarating and liberating - for both Sully and the audience. \n \n (Early on in Dances With Wolves, Costner's Lt. Dunbar is in danger of having his leg amputated - go figure.) \n \n Cameron is not a filmmaker to shy away from spectacle and the gizmos to deliver it. The first two Terminators, Aliens (with Weaver), The Abyss, and, of course, Titanic, all cost plenty, but with the exception of The Abyss, they sold more than enough tickets to make up for the expenditure. Whether Avatar recoups its outsize production and marketing outlays is a topic for the business wags to mull. \n \n For the folks who plunk down their dollars (and pick up the plastic 3-D glasses), Avatar delivers. Combining beyond-state-of-the-art moviemaking with a tried-and-true storyline and a gamer-geek sensibility - not to mention a love angle, an otherworldly bestiary, and an arsenal of 22d-century weaponry - the movie quite simply rocks. \n \n Contact movie critic Steven Rea at 215-854-5629 or srea@phillynews.com.

Parent's guide: PG-13 (for intense epic battle sequences and warfare, sensuality, language and some smoking). ||||| Movie Review \n \n With \u201cAvatar\u201d James Cameron has turned one man\u2019s dream of the movies into a trippy joy ride about the end of life \u2014 our moviegoing life included \u2014 as we know it. Several decades in the dreaming and more than four years in the actual making, the movie is a song to the natural world that was largely produced with software, an Emersonian exploration of the invisible world of the spirit filled with Cameronian rock \u2019em, sock \u2019em pulpy action. Created to conquer hearts, minds, history books and box-office records, the movie \u2014 one of the most expensive in history, the jungle drums thump \u2014 is glorious and goofy and blissfully deranged. \n \n The story behind the story, including a production budget estimated to top $230 million, and Mr. Cameron\u2019s future-shock ambitions for the medium have already begun to settle into myth (a process partly driven by the publicity, certainly). Every filmmaker is something of a visionary, just by virtue of the medium. But Mr. Cameron, who directed the megamelodrama \u201cTitanic\u201d and, more notably, several of the most influential science-fiction films of the past few decades (\u201cThe Terminator,\u201d \u201cAliens\u201d and \u201cThe Abyss\u201d), is a filmmaker whose ambitions transcend a single movie or mere stories to embrace cinema as an art, as a social experience and a shamanistic ritual, one still capable of producing the big WOW. \n \n The scale of his new movie, which brings you into a meticulous and brilliantly colored alien world for a fast 2 hours 46 minutes, factors into that wow. Its scope is evident in an early scene on a spaceship (the year is 2154), where the passengers, including a paraplegic ex-Marine, Jake (Sam Worthington, a gruffly sensitive heartthrob), are being roused from a yearslong sleep before landing on a distant inhabited moon, Pandora. Jake is woken by an attendant floating in zero gravity, one of many such aides. As Jake himself glides through the bright cavernous space, you know you\u2019re not in Kansas anymore, as someone soon quips (a nod to \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d Mr. Cameron\u2019s favorite film). You also know you\u2019re not in the gloom of \u201cThe Matrix.\u201d \n \n Though it\u2019s easy to pigeonhole Mr. Cameron as a gear head who\u2019s more interested in cool tools (which here include 3-D), he is, with \u201cAvatar,\u201d also making a credible attempt to create a paradigm shift in science-fiction cinema. Since it was first released in 1999, \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d which owes a large debt to Mr. Cameron\u2019s own science-fiction films as well as the literary subgenre of cyberpunk, has hung heavily over both SF and action filmmaking. Most films that crib from \u201cThe Matrix\u201d tend to borrow only its slo-mo death waltzes and leather fetishism, keeping its nihilism while ditching the intellectual inquiries. Although \u201cAvatar\u201d delivers a late kick to the gut that might be seen as nihilistic (and how!), it is strangely utopian. \n \n It doesn\u2019t take Jake long to feel the good vibes. Like Neo, the savior-hero of the \u201cMatrix\u201d series played by Keanu Reeves, Jake is himself an avatar because he\u2019s both a special being and an embodiment of an idea, namely that of the hero\u2019s journey. What initially makes Jake unusual is that he has been tapped to inhabit a part-alien, part-human body that he controls, like a puppeteer, from its head to its prehensile tail. Like the rest of the human visitors who\u2019ve made camp on Pandora, he has signed on with a corporation that\u2019s intent on extracting a valuable if mysterious substance from the moon called unobtainium, a great whatsit that is an emblem of humanity\u2019s greed and folly. With his avatar, Jake will look just like one of the natives, the Na\u2019vi, a new identity that gives the movie its plot turns and politics. \n \n The first part of Jake\u2019s voyage \u2014 for this is, above all, a boy\u2019s rocking adventure, if one populated by the usual tough Cameron chicks \u2014 takes him from a wheelchair into a 10-foot, blue-skinned Na\u2019vi body. At once familiar and pleasingly exotic, the humanoid Na\u2019vi come with supermodel dimensions (slender hips, a miniature-apple rear); long articulated digits, the better to grip with; and the slanted eyes and twitchy ears of a cat. (The gently curved stripes that line their blue skin, the color of twilight, bring to mind the markings on mackerel tabby cats.) For Jake his avatar, which he hooks into through sensors while lying in a remote pod in a semiconscious state, is at first a giddy novelty and then a means to liberation. \n \n Plugging into the avatar gives Jake an instant high, allowing him to run, leap and sift dirt through his toes, and freeing him from the constraints of his body. Although physically emancipated, he remains bound, contractually and existentially, to the base camp, where he works for the corporation\u2019s top scientist, Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver, amused and amusing), even while taking orders from its head of security, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a military man turned warrior for hire. A cartoon of masculinity, Quaritch strides around barking orders like some intransigent representation of American military might (or a bossy movie director). It\u2019s a favorite Cameron type, and Mr. Lang, who until this year had long been grievously underemployed, tears into the role like a starved man gorging on steak. \n \n Mr. Cameron lays out the fundamentals of the narrative efficiently, grabbing you at once with one eye-popping detail after another and on occasion almost losing you with some of the comically broad dialogue. He\u2019s a masterly storyteller if a rather less nimble prose writer. (He has sole script credit: this is personal filmmaking on an industrial scale.) Some of the clunkier lines (\u201cYeah, who\u2019s bad,\u201d Jake taunts a rhinolike creature he encounters) seem to have been written to placate those members of the Michael Bay demographic who might find themselves squirming at the story\u2019s touchier, feelier elements, its ardent environmentalism and sincere love story, all of which kick in once Jake meets Neytiri, a female Na\u2019vi (Zo\u00eb Saldana, seen only in slinky Na\u2019vi form). \n \n Mr. Cameron has said that he started thinking about the alien universe that became Pandora and its galactic environs in \u201cAvatar\u201d back in the 1970s. He wrote a treatment in 1996, but the technologies he needed to turn his ideas into images didn\u2019t exist until recently. New digital technologies gave him the necessary tools, including performance capture, which translates an actor\u2019s physical movements into a computer-generated image (CGI). Until now, by far the most plausible character created in this manner has been slithery Gollum from Peter Jackson\u2019s \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d cycle. The exotic creatures in \u201cAvatar,\u201d which include an astonishment of undulating, flying, twitching and galloping organisms, don\u2019t just crawl through the underbrush; they thunder and shriek, yip and hiss, pointy teeth gleaming. \n \n The most important of these are the Na\u2019vi, and while their movements can bring to mind old-fashioned stop-motion animation, their faces are a triumph of tech innovation, with tremors and twitches that make them immediately appealing and empathetic. By the time Neytiri ushers Jake into her world of wonders \u2014 a lush dreamscape filled with kaleidoscopic and bioluminescent flora and fauna, with pink jellyfishlike creatures that hang in the air and pleated orange flowers that snap shut like parasols \u2014 you are deep in the Na\u2019vi-land. It\u2019s a world that looks as if it had been created by someone who\u2019s watched a lot of Jacques Cousteau television or, like Mr. Cameron, done a lot of diving. It\u2019s also familiar because, like John Smith in \u201cThe New World,\u201d Terrence Malick\u2019s retelling of the Pocahontas story, Jake has discovered Eden. \n \n An Eden in three dimensions, that is. In keeping with his maximalist tendencies, Mr. Cameron has shot \u201cAvatar\u201d in 3-D (because many theaters are not equipped to show 3-D, the movie will also be shown in the usual 2), an experiment that serves his material beautifully. This isn\u2019t the 3-D of the 1950s or even contemporary films, those flicks that try to give you a virtual poke in the eye with flying spears. Rather Mr. Cameron uses 3-D to amplify the immersive experience of spectacle cinema. Instead of bringing you into the movie with the customary tricks, with a widescreen or even Imax image filled with sweeping landscapes and big action, he uses 3-D seemingly to close the space between the audience and the screen. He brings the movie to you. \n \n After a few minutes the novelty of people and objects hovering above the row in front of you wears off, and you tend not to notice the 3-D, which speaks to the subtlety of its use and potential future applications. Mr. Cameron might like to play with high-tech gadgets, but he\u2019s an old-fashioned filmmaker at heart, and he wants us to get as lost in his fictional paradise as Jake eventually does. On the face of it there might seem something absurd about a movie that asks you to thrill to a natural world made almost entirely out of zeroes and ones (and that feeds you an anticorporate line in a corporately financed entertainment). But one of the pleasures of the movies is that they transport us, as Neytiri does with Jake, into imaginary realms, into Eden and over the rainbow to Oz. \n \n If the story of a paradise found and potentially lost feels resonant, it\u2019s because \u201cAvatar\u201d is as much about our Earth as the universe that Mr. Cameron has invented. But the movie\u2019s truer meaning is in the audacity of its filmmaking. \n \n Few films return us to the lost world of our first cinematic experiences, to that magical moment when movies really were bigger than life (instead of iPhone size), if only because we were children. Movies rarely carry us away, few even try. They entertain and instruct and sometimes enlighten. Some attempt to overwhelm us, but their efforts are usually a matter of volume. What\u2019s often missing is awe, something Mr. Cameron has, after an absence from Hollywood, returned to the screen with a vengeance. He hasn\u2019t changed cinema, but with blue people and pink blooms he has confirmed its wonder. \n \n \u201cAvatar\u201d is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Gun and explosive violence, death and despair. \n \n AVATAR \n \n Opens on Friday nationwide. \n \n Written and directed by James Cameron; director of photography, Mauro Fiore; edited by Mr. Cameron, John Refoua and Stephen Rivkin; music by James Horner; visual effects supervisor, Joe Letteri; production designers, Rick Carter and Robert Stromberg; produced by Mr. Cameron and Jon Landau; released by 20th Century Fox.

The discovery may lead to safety systems in cars that can correct dangerous steering movements before they occur. \n \n The ability to predict what a driver is going to do in the near future and to be able to prepare the car's system for this sounds a little bit like science fiction, and it would naturally be a dream come true for the safety departments at car manufacturers. The dream is now one step closer to becoming reality. \n \n \"With the driver model I have developed, it is possible to predict what drivers are going to do with the steering wheel before they do it. It is possible to predict how far the driver is going to turn the wheel, right when the person starts a wheel-turning movement. It's like looking into the future,\" says Chalmers researcher Ola Benderius. \n \n As a result of the recently published discovery, several applications for car support systems can be developed to make our cars safer. Smarter anti-skid systems and systems for fatigued drivers are two examples of potential usage areas. \n \n \"Imagine a fatigued driver on the verge of running off the road. He or she suddenly wakes up and reflexively initiates a very large corrective manoeuvre, a potential misjudgement that can lead to something very dangerous. Since we are now able to predict how far the driver is going to turn the wheel, the vehicle's support systems can identify potential misjudgements and intervene, which means a serious accident, such as the car travelling into approaching traffic, can be avoided,\" says Ola Benderius. \n \n What is the mystery that Ola Benderius has solved? As early as 1947, the well-known British researcher Arnold Tustin (1899-1994) produced the first model for how a person steers towards a target. He identified a continuous and linear control behaviour. When a car is driven, this corresponds to the driver gently and continuously following the road with the steering wheel. This behaviour is known as tracking within control theory, and it has been the prevailing theory for car driving ever since. However, when comparing the linear model with actual measured data, some deviations become apparent, namely jerkiness in the steering signal. \n \n Tustin saw these deviations from the continuous prediction as well, but the mystery has remained unsolved until now. Ola Benderius and his colleague Gustav Markkula got the idea while they were attending a lecture on neurocognition at Sahlgrenska University Hospital. The lecture addressed the behavioural theory of reaching, which concerns the basic human behaviour when we reach for something. \n \n When studying how we humans move our hand from Point A to pick up something from Point B, the speed of the movement has a direct relationship with the distance - the longer the distance, the quicker the movement. The interesting effect of this is that the time for the movement is the same regardless of the distance. \n \n \"We immediately recognised this pattern from our measured steer signals,\" says Ola Benderius. \"It was a bit of a eureka moment. Was it possible that this basic human behaviour also controlled how we steer a car?\" \n \n With the idea in mind, Ola Benderius extracted over 1,000 hours of car and truck driving from real driving data, which resulted in 1.3 million steer corrections. It turned out that 95 per cent of these correspond with the reaching theory. Ola Benderius and Gustav Markkula had discovered that steering is not linear when the driver follows the road, but rather that the driver turns the wheel according to the special reaching pattern. \n \n \"We were able to use the theory to explain what researchers had been trying to solve for a long time. This was the answer to the previously inexplicable jerkiness in the control signal. Rather than looking upon steering as continuously following the road, steering corrections seem to be applied in a very predetermined manner,\" says Ola Benderius. \"The control behaviour has also proven to be very natural; I saw this in an earlier study where I examined driving behaviour in 12 year olds and their parents.\" \n \n With this new knowledge, he was able to develop a mathematical model that can explain many observed steering behaviours, which means that the driver response to different situations can be predicted before it occurs. Ola Benderius believes the discovery will have an impact on an entire research field. \n \n \"This might completely change how we regard human control of vehicles, crafts and vessels. I hope and believe that many researchers will utilise the findings and start to think in new ways. Control behaviour has traditionally been studied on the basis of control theory and technical systems. If it is instead studied on the basis of neuroscience with focus on the human, an entire new world opens up. This could push the research field in an entirely different direction,\" says Ola Benderius. \n \n ### \n \n Facts About the Research \n \n The research has been conducted within the Adaptive systems research group at the Department of Applied Mechanics at Chalmers University of Technology. It has been financed by the Safer Vehicle and Traffic Safety Centre at Chalmers and the FFI research programme. \n \n The discovery of the innate steering behaviour was recently published as a scientific paper, \"Evidence for a fundamental property of steering\": http://publications. lib. chalmers. se/ publication/ 205499-evidence-for-a-fundamental-property-of-steering",
    "reference": "\u2013 \"Think before you jerk.\u201d \u201cJerking isn\u2019t a joke.\" Such slogans, as reported in the Washington Post and elsewhere, garnered national attention when used to remind drivers in South Dakota not to over-correct their steering on slick roads. Indeed, the standard theory behind the way we steer our cars dates back to the 1940s but has left us with a longstanding mystery: data shows that we have a habit of jerking the wheel from time to time, puzzling researchers. Now, experts in Sweden are explaining the phenomenon, and their findings could lead to better safety systems in cars, according to a release at Eureka Alert. The jerkiness is tied to the way humans reach for things: When something is close by, we move our arms more slowly to grab it than we do when it's further away. The result is that both movements take the same amount of time. \"We immediately recognized this pattern\" as similar to steering behaviors, a researcher says. \"It was a bit of a eureka moment. Was it possible that this basic human behavior also controlled how we steer a car?\" A study of more than 1,000 hours of drivers' movements suggests that it certainly was. The team developed a mathematical model addressing the behavior; now, \"it is possible to predict how far the driver is going to turn the wheel, right when the person starts a wheel-turning movement. It's like looking into the future,\" the researcher says. That could improve safety: For instance, if a sleepy driver is edging off the road, his car's support system could predict how much he's going to jerk the wheel to try to correct things, often disastrously, and intervene to prevent it. (South Dakota eventually decided to drop the \"don't jerk and drive\" campaign.)"

    "input": "Twenty years ago this December, James Cameron\u2019s Titanic sailed into theaters. It was made for a then-record breaking $210 million, and proceeded to break more records at the box office with a haul that has grossed over $2 billion. It was nominated for 14 Oscars and ended up collecting 11 overall, including for best picture and director for Cameron. Audiences went home with tears in their eyes and Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet\u2019s Jack and Rose in their hearts. \n \n Time to bring out the tissues again. Cameron has recently remastered his classic, and Titanic will return to theaters beginning December 1, this time in a laser-projected Dolby Vision format the filmmaker hopes will see wider industry adoption. Ahead of that re-release, on Sunday, the National Geographic Channel will air the documentary Titanic: 20 Years Later with James Cameron. \n \n Cameron spoke with Vanity Fair recently about some of Titanic\u2019s unanswered questions, what a sale of the 20th Century Fox movie studio would mean for him, and how his work on the Avatar and Terminator franchises is progressing. \n \n Vanity Fair: Do you think any movie studio in 2017 would greenlight a movie like Titanic today? \n \n James Cameron: They\u2019re greenlighting movies twice that expensive. \n \n But different ones. \n \n It was a very peculiar set of circumstances that even got that film greenlit in the first place. It was an anomaly and of course I\u2019m lucky and grateful that it happened. But I don\u2019t think the industry has changed that much in 20 years when it comes to risk aversion. They were risk averse then, and they\u2019re risk averse now. And all the trends everybody\u2019s always talking about, \u201cOh, well it\u2019s only franchises, it\u2019s only comic books.\u201d You know what? It was that stuff back then. It\u2019s not like we\u2019re getting any smarter. \n \n Kate Winslet has a role in one of the Avatar sequels, which you\u2019ve said partly take place underwater. Can you tell me about it? \n \n She does, and she\u2019s very excited about it. She blazed through for a couple of days of rehearsals and saw the world that we had created, and how we do the work, and she\u2019s very excited. She plays a character who\u2019s part of the Sea People, the reef people. The one thing she did do is demand that she do all her own water work. I said, \u201cAll right, that\u2019s fine, we\u2019ll have to teach you how to free dive.\u201d The other actors are up to three- and four-minute breath holds. We\u2019ve already been doing underwater capture. We did a scene last week with six teenagers, well, actually five teenagers and one 7-year-old underwater holding their breath for a couple minutes and acting, actually doing a dialogue scene under water because they speak kind of a sign language. \n \n One question that people ask me a lot about Titanic, and I\u2019m assuming they ask you this a lot, is at the end, why doesn\u2019t Rose make room for Jack on the door? \n \n And the answer is very simple because it says on page 147 [of the script] that Jack dies. Very simple. . . . Obviously it was an artistic choice, the thing was just big enough to hold her, and not big enough to hold him . . . I think it\u2019s all kind of silly, really, that we\u2019re having this discussion 20 years later. But it does show that the film was effective in making Jack so endearing to the audience that it hurts them to see him die. Had he lived, the ending of the film would have been meaningless. . . . The film is about death and separation; he had to die. So whether it was that, or whether a smoke stack fell on him, he was going down. It\u2019s called art, things happen for artistic reasons, not for physics reasons. \n \n Well, you\u2019re usually such a stickler for physics . . . \n \n I am. I was in the water with the piece of wood putting people on it for about two days getting it exactly buoyant enough so that it would support one person with full free-board, meaning that she wasn\u2019t immersed at all in the 28 degree water so that she could survive the three hours it took until the rescue ship got there. [Jack] didn\u2019t know that she was gonna get picked up by a lifeboat an hour later; he was dead anyway. And we very, very finely tuned it to be exactly what you see in the movie because I believed at the time, and still do, that that\u2019s what it would have taken for one person to survive. \n \n \u00a920thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection \n \n Given the nudity and violence, how did Titanic end up with a PG-13 rating? Did you have to make a case to the M.P.A.A. for it? \n \n Maybe it\u2019s the haze of time, but I don\u2019t recall it being controversial. When we submitted it we did say that the nudity was artistic and not erotic. And I guess they bought that. And at the time, I think their standard for a small amount of frontal nudity above the waist was more relaxed than it is now. Which is a little bizarre, but there you have it. \n \n What do you remember from the night Titanic won the Oscars? \n \n I remember almost getting in a fight with Harvey Weinstein and hitting him with my Oscar. \n \n In retrospect there are probably a lot of people . . . \n \n That would\u2019ve preferred I had played through on that one. . . . It was happening on the main floor at the [theater] . . . And the music had started to play to get back in our seats. The people around us were saying, \u201cNot here! Not here!\u201d Like it was O.K. to fight in the parking lot, you know, but it was not O.K. there when the music was playing, and they were about to go live. \n \n What were you and Harvey discussing that led to this altercation? \n \n It\u2019s kind of a long story, but it has to do with Guillermo del Toro and how badly he was dealt with by Miramax on Mimic. Harvey came up glad-handing me, talking about how great they were for the artist, and I just read him chapter and verse about how great I thought he was for the artist based on my friend\u2019s experience, and that led to an altercation. \n \n You made Titanic for 20th Century Fox, which has been your longtime studio home. And you\u2019re making the Avatar sequels for them, but there are reports now that the Murdochs are interested in selling the movie studio. What would that mean for you and your films? \n \n Probably not that much. I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with Fox. If they sold to Disney that wouldn\u2019t be bad because Disney actually at this point in time has a bigger investment in Avatar than Fox does in terms of spent money. \n \n Because of the Pandora\u2014The World of Avatar themed land at Disney World? \n \n Yeah, exactly. So I get along great with Fox; I\u2019m sure I\u2019d get along great with Disney. \n \n With all of the work going into the Avatar sequels there have been some delays in getting started. \n \n I wouldn\u2019t call them delays. It was highly optimistic that we could start quickly until scripts are written. If there\u2019s no scripts, there\u2019s nothing, right? The scripts took four years. You can call that a delay, but it\u2019s not really a delay because from the time we pushed the button to really go make the movies [until now,] we\u2019re clicking along perfectly. We\u2019re doing very well because of all the time that we had to develop the system and the pipeline and all that. We weren\u2019t wasting time, we were putting it into tech development and design. So when all the scripts were approved, everything was designed. Every character, every creature, every setting. In a funny way it was to the benefit of the film because the design team had more time to work. . . . Most of the actors, the key principals, have all read all four scripts, so they know exactly what their character arcs are, they know where they\u2019re going, they know how to modulate their arc now across the first two films. We all know where we\u2019re supposed to be dramatically in the saga, and that\u2019s great. Let\u2019s face it, if Avatar 2 and 3 don\u2019t make enough money, there\u2019s not going to be a 4 and 5. They\u2019re fully encapsulated stories in and of themselves. It builds across the five films to a greater kind of meta narrative, but they\u2019re fully formed films in their own right, unlike, say, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where you really just had to sort of go, \u201cOh, shit, all right, well I guess I better come back next year.\u201d Even though that all worked and everybody did. \n \n \u00a920thCentFox/Courtesy Everett Collection \n \n Will the Avatar sequels deal with some of the similar themes you addressed in the first film, in particular, the environment? \n \n It will be a natural extension of all the themes, and the characters, and the spiritual undercurrents. Basically, if you loved the first movie, you\u2019re gonna love these movies, and if you hated it, you\u2019re probably gonna hate these. If you loved it at the time, and you said later you hated it, you\u2019re probably gonna love these. \n \n And the Terminator film, how is that going? \n \n We\u2019re cranking along. . . . It\u2019s the first of three, the story is mapped out over a three-film arc, but again, if we don\u2019t make any money there isn\u2019t gonna be a two and a three. Technically, we\u2019re thinking of them as three, four, and five. As if Terminator, and Terminator 2 exist, and the other ones are kind of alternate time lines that are no longer relevant. \n \n What made you want to return to that world? \n \n I just feel like the world we live in now is going to be very much defined by our co-evolution with our technology. While technology and innovation have this vast promise for our survival, it\u2019s also an enormous threat, especially when it comes to strong [artificial intelligence] being coupled with weaponized robotics, and that\u2019s all coming. It\u2019s just a question of who gets there first, it\u2019s gonna be the next big arms race, it\u2019s gonna be like the next race to get the bomb . . . And when you couple that with the kind of wired world that we live in, where we\u2019ve basically given away our privacy and every single person walking around that\u2019s got a smartphone is essentially a belled cat\u2014a walking sensor platform that can be monitored from afar\u2014it\u2019s like we\u2019re really on the cusp of an Orwellian Armageddon of inconceivable proportions. Therefore, I thought, hey, let\u2019s make a movie about that. So it\u2019s going to be a very cheerful and upbeat kind of film. \n \n When Titanic hits theaters again in December, will you go see it? \n \n Yeah, I want to see it in its entirety. I want to bring family and friends to see it in HDR. . . . Seeing a film that everybody knows, but seeing it in HDR in 3-D with proper light levels on a Dolby Vision laser projector\u2014it\u2019s really a glimpse of the future. . . . We had the whole film remastered in HDR, and it\u2019s stunning. It\u2019s beyond 70 millimeter, it\u2019s beyond any format that you\u2019ve seen before. What we\u2019re trying to do is get Paramount and Fox to support the rollout of the Dolby Vision cinema project. It occurred to me, hey, we\u2019ve got a movie that\u2019s an evergreen that people love, why don\u2019t we slam it into theaters and let people see it, not in a way it should be seen, but a way far beyond what any movie looks like right now, other than some new films are being authored in HDR? Obviously the [new] Avatar films will be [in Dolby Vision] as well, and in fact, we\u2019re also going to do a conversion of Avatar to HDR. We\u2019ll re-release that at some point down the line; I want to try to help this rollout of the Dolby cinemas, because I think it\u2019s fantastic what they\u2019re doing. ||||| Rose had to let go. \n \n Two decades after the Titanic sank on the big screen, director James Cameron is still defending one of Hollywood\u2019s most heartbreaking movie deaths. \n \n After joking to Vanity Fair that Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) froze to death hanging off a wooden plank clearly big enough for him and Rose (Kate Winslet) happened \u201cbecause it says on page 147 (of the script) that Jack dies,\ufffd?

His popularity has slipped recently amid sexual harassment allegations from several women, which he has denied. \n \n The Versailles restaurant is the de facto headquarters of Miami's Cuban exile community and a required stop for anyone seeking votes among conservative Republican Cuban-Americans. \n \n Following the familiar drill, Cain stepped up to the carry-out window to sample Cuban-style coffee, served strong and syrupy sweet in a tiny cup.

He said he understood hard work and \"sweat equity,\" prompting several in the crowd to shout back \"We're sweating now.\" \n \n \"We're sweating now!\" Cain took up the cry. \n \n One woman at the restaurant asked who Cain was, then walked away in a huff when it became clear the counter staff was too distracted to fulfill her pastry order. \n \n But another middle-aged woman gave him a tight hug and declared, \"I love you\" as Cain walked through the restaurant. \n \n \"He has my same philosophy, he's a true conservative,\" said the woman, Fanny Roca. She said she did not believe the sexual harassment allegations against him and thought they were part of a media attempt to smear Cain as his campaign took off. \n \n \"They waited until he came at the top of the polls to say it.

Broder, 81, a Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for The Washington Post and one of the most respected writers on national politics for four decades, died Wednesday at Capital Hospice in Arlington of complications from diabetes. \n \n Mr. Broder was often called the dean of the Washington press corps - a nickname he earned in his late 30s in part for the clarity of his political analysis and the influence he wielded as a perceptive thinker on political trends in his books, articles and television appearances. \n \n In 1973, Mr. Broder and The Post each won Pulitzers for coverage of the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard M. Nixon's resignation. Mr. Broder's citation was for explaining the importance of the Watergate fallout in a clear, compelling way. \n \n As passionate about baseball as he was about politics, he likened Nixon's political career to an often-traded pitcher who had \"bounced around his league.\" \n \n He covered every presidential convention since 1956 and was widely regarded as the political journalist with the best-informed contacts, from the lowliest precinct to the highest rungs of government. \n \n Former Post executive editor Benjamin C. Bradlee called Mr. Broder \"the best political correspondent in America. David knew politics from the back room up - the mechanics of politics, the county and state chairmen - whereas most Washington reporters knew it at the Washington level.\" \n \n Mr. Broder was praised at the highest echelons of political power.

He was a frequent and instantly recognizable panelist on TV news-discussion shows, a penetrating questioner who often put politicians on the spot and a clear-eyed analyst who could cut to the heart of an issue. \n \n On \"Meet the Press\" in 1987, he probed whether then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, the GOP front-runner in the next year's White House race, was too much an Eastern patrician to understand average Americans. \n \n Mr. Broder asked the candidate whether he knew how many Americans lacked health insurance and how many U.S. children were born into poverty. \n \n Bush said he didn't know, adding: \"We have the best medical-attention system in the world, and I don't want to see it go into the mode of England or this whole concept of socialized medicine where the government provides absolutely everything.

But in this case, they are irresistible. \n \n The simple fact is that there is little Washington can do about the impact of successive years of terrible winter weather or the upheaval in Cairo, which threatens America's interests in the Middle East. \n \n Let's deal with the latter first. America has a long history in Egypt - too long a history. It goes back to King Farouk, a name that means nothing to many people these days. Nobody younger than my generation can summon a mental picture of the chain-smoking playboy emperor of Cairo. But he was our man for a time in the early 1950s, and the Egyptian people have neither forgotten nor forgiven. \n \n We did business with Egypt because of our interest in the Suez Canal, the vital waterway where much of the world's oil supply is transported from the Persian Gulf. That interest was so great that President Dwight D. Eisenhower rebuffed two of our staunchest allies, Britain and France, when they decided to try to wrest control of the canal from Egypt. \n \n This made us briefly popular with the people in Cairo, but it did not last. Subsequent leaders who supported us, culminating in Hosni Mubarak, have been increasingly unpopular with their own populace. \n \n Which brings me back to my analogy. \n \n As a Cubs fan and more recently a Nationals supporter, I am accustomed to spending Septembers reading about other teams' pursuit of the World Series. Whether it is the Red Sox fending off the Yankees, or the Giants five months ago trying to gain entry for the first time since the 1989 earthquake, those who share my history have learned that it's no fun watching other teams at such historic events. \n \n You know that something big is happening and that it will inevitably affect you. But you don't know whom to root for, and ultimately you realize that events will unfold and you have almost no influence on the outcome. \n \n That is the reality that confronts President Obama today. His hands are tied while Egypt erupts. \n \n At first he expressed support and sympathy for the democratic forces filling the streets and appreciation for the Egyptian military holding fire. But when it became clear that Mubarak was on his way out, sooner or later, it dawned on everyone that the Muslim Brotherhood might seize on the resulting power vacuum and chaos to erect a hostile regime on the banks of the Suez Canal. \n \n Whom do you root for in a situation like this? \n \n I turn with relief to the weather. Washington was shut down by snow for a whole workweek last winter because we have no capacity to deal with even a few flakes. Aside from one nightmare evening recently, this year we have been spared. But seeing the photographs of hundreds of cars and buses stranded on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago on Tuesday evening brought back memories of other blizzards that made it an adventure even to cross the Midway from Burton-Judson Courts to Cobb Hall for a history class at the University of Chicago. \n \n I have so often driven Lake Shore Drive, either to its exit on Sheridan Road or partway north to Addison, where all roads lead to the Friendly Confines of Wrigley Field, that I could feel for the drivers and passengers who could not reach the nearest exit ramp because of all the stalled vehicles. Lake Shore Drive, better known as the Outer Drive, terminated at the Edgewater Beach Hotel, whose pristine beach was rarely populated by its elderly residents. But it stopped traffic from going straight into Evanston, the home of the two most elitist institutions in the area, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Northwestern University, even when there was no blizzard raging. On Tuesday you couldn't even get to the Edgewater. \n \n There was nothing you could do about it. Just like the United States in Egypt. \n \n davidbroder@washpost.com",

McGahn as White House counsel, selecting a seasoned political lawyer who could help navigate the growing scrutiny on potential conflicts of interest between the president-elect\u2019s businesses and his incoming administration. \n \n McGahn, a partner at the Jones Day law firm in Washington and a former chairman of the Federal Election Commission, had served as an adviser to Trump\u2019s campaign. His specialties include government ethics, the president-elect\u2019s transition team said in a statement Friday announcing his selection. \n \n Donald F. McGahn Photographer: Drew Angerer/Getty Images \n \n \u201cDon has a brilliant legal mind, excellent character and a deep understanding of constitutional law,\u201d Trump said in the statement. \u201cHe will play a critical role in our administration.\u201d \n \n Even before Trump is sworn in as president on Jan. 20, McGahn will be tasked with helping the real-estate developer navigate an extensive web of business ties and commercial interests that stand as potential conflicts of interest. Trump\u2019s licensing deals and other businesses have drawn renewed scrutiny since he was elected president on Nov. 8, yet he said this week in an interview with the New York Times that as a sitting U.S. president, he \u201ccan\u2019t have a conflict of interest.\u201d \n \n Executive Orders \n \n The White House counsel is also responsible for preparing executive orders issued by the president, ensuring that they are constitutional. Trump has pledged to rescind many of President Barack Obama\u2019s orders, saying they exceeded his powers, while vowing to issue his own on issues such as restricting immigration from countries compromised by Islamic terrorists. \n \n Trump is in Florida for the Thanksgiving holiday. Transition officials said on a conference call Friday that he\u2019ll meet in New York on Nov. 28 with former BB&T Corp. Chief Executive Officer John Allison, who\u2019s said to be a contender for Treasury Secretary, and with former Securities and Exchange Commissioner Paul Atkins. \n \n In addition to McGahn\u2019s selection, the transition team announced that Kathleen Troia \u201cKT\u201d McFarland was named deputy national security adviser. Neither of the two positions filled on Friday requires confirmation by the Senate. \n \n KT McFarland participates in a debate in New York on Aug. 9, 2006. AP Photo/Angel Chevrestt, Pool \n \n McFarland, 65, has a long record of national security experience, serving as deputy assistant secretary of defense for public affairs in the early 1980s under President Ronald Reagan. McFarland also has worked as a national security analyst and a contributor to Fox News. She ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate in New York in 2006. \n \n Obama Critic \n \n \u201cI am proud that KT has once again decided to serve our country and join my national security team,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cShe has tremendous experience and innate talent that will complement the fantastic team we are assembling, which is crucial because nothing is more important than keeping our people safe.\u201d \n \n McFarland would report to retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, who was named Trump\u2019s national security adviser last week. She has praised Trump for his instincts, saying they make up for his lack of experience in government and national security. \n \n \u201cForeign policy, national security, defense is not the president-elect\u2019s skill,\u201d she said last week on Fox News. \u201cHe didn\u2019t come into the job with a lot of experience and background in it but in talking about the issues, he gets right to the core.\u201d \n \n \u2018It\u2019s Chaos\u2019 \n \n McFarland worked as an aide to then-National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. She helped write a groundbreaking speech in 1984 by then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger that described U.S. policy on use of military force under Reagan and later became known as the Weinberger Doctrine. \n \n In recent years, she has been critical of the Obama administration\u2019s approach to foreign policy, accusing the president of a weak approach to terrorism and other global threats. \n \n \u201cThe alternative to American leadership in the world is not some kumbaya world peace, global world order, like Obama says,\u201d she said last year on the Fox Business Network. \u201cIt\u2019s chaos, or it\u2019s dictatorship.\u201d \n \n Praise for Putin \n \n In 2013, after Obama opted against a military strike against the Syrian government\u2019s chemical weapons stockpiles, McFarland wrote that Russian President Vladimir Putin deserved the credit for using diplomacy to stave off the attack. In a deal between the U.S., Russia and the Syrian government, chemical material was shipped out of Syria in 2014. \n \n \u201cThe world knows that Vladimir Putin is the one who really deserves that Nobel Peace Prize,\u201d she wrote on FoxNews.com in September of 2013. \u201cIt turns out that leading from behind left a big opening up front. Putin stepped right in. And Obama still hasn\u2019t figured it out.\u201d \n \n After extremists in Paris killed 130 people last January, McFarland called for stricter counterterrorism policies in the U.S., including \u201cterrorist profiling.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe need to take a different approach to fighting terrorism than the one-size-fits-all, politically correct policy we have had in place for over a decade,\u201d she wrote on FoxNews.com last year. \n \n McGahn at FEC \n \n McGahn served as a member of the Federal Election Commission, charged with overseeing the nation\u2019s election laws, from 2008 to 2013. Those laws underwent dramatic changes after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, which allowed corporations to spend unlimited sums on political speech. That resulted in groups known as super-PACs raising millions from deep-pocketed donors. \n \n McGahn oversaw a major rewrite of the FEC\u2019s procedures, which he has said brought unprecedented transparency and due process to the agency. Critics say that instead he placed too much power in the hands of the often deadlocked commissioners -- there are six, three from each party, who often split on partisan lines -- while hamstringing its career staff, limiting its effectiveness. \n \n \u201cMcGahn ran a one-man agency nullification program,\u201d said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign-finance watchdog. \u201cHe rejected core parts of the FEC\u2019s enforcement mandate and successfully employed obstructionism over good faith negotiations with his fellow commissioners.\u201d \n \n Before his stint at the FEC, McGahn served as general counsel to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the party committee for GOP House members, for almost a decade. \n \n Get the latest on global politics in your inbox, every day.

Yet the interview, in which Trump said he was surprised to learn there were no laws requiring him to transfer assets to a blind trust, raised more questions over how he\u2019ll handle his business empire after taking office. \n \n Recent media reports singled out the president-elect\u2019s links to a Philippine developer who has been appointed that nation\u2019s envoy to the U.S.; disclosed that Trump took a break from transition planning to meet with three business partners building Trump-branded towers in India; and said that Ivanka Trump sat in on a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ||||| WASHINGTON \u2014 President-elect Donald J. Trump filled two lower-profile but influential White House staff jobs on Friday, while his high-profile candidate for secretary of housing and urban development, Ben Carson, continued to deliberate about whether to join the administration. \n \n Mr. Trump offered the housing job this week to Mr. Carson, a neurosurgeon who challenged him for the Republican presidential nomination. But despite expectations of a Friday announcement, Mr. Carson was \u201cstill pondering,\u201d said a friend, Armstrong Williams. The president-elect\u2019s aides said Mr. Trump did not plan any more cabinet-level announcements until next week. \n \n For the politically sensitive post of White House counsel, Mr. Trump chose Donald F. McGahn II, a Washington election lawyer who pushed to deregulate campaign finance and election laws. The counsel\u2019s job may be even more daunting than it was in previous administrations, given Mr. Trump\u2019s far-flung business empire, with which he shows no inclination toward severing ties. \n \n For the equally critical job of deputy national security adviser, Mr. Trump chose K. T. McFarland, an aide in three Republican White Houses and a Fox News commentator. She has been highly critical of President Obama\u2019s approach to combating terrorism \u2014 a view that aligns her with Mr. Trump\u2019s choice for national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T.

In the video, Finicum notes decades-old papers strewn across the floor, and one box allegedly containing a rat's nest. \n \n \"We are concerned about the way artifacts are stored here, the Paiute's artifacts, and so we're reaching out to the Paiute tribe to say we need to open up a communication,\" Finicum said. \"We want to make sure that these things are returned to their rightful owners and that they're taken care of.\" \n \n Despite the militiamen's assertion that they intend to save Paiute artifacts from the government, tribe members argue it is the militiamen that their belongings need protecting from. In a letter to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service last week, the tribe requested assistance in protecting Paiute artifacts from the armed protesters, calling for an inventory of items in the refuge, and criminal prosecution of the group under the Archeological Resources Protection Act. \n \n See also: Oregon militants want you to stop sending them dildos \n \n \"They continue to desecrate one of our most important sacred sites,\" Burns Paiute Tribal Chair Charlotte Rodrique said in a news release. \"They should be held accountable.\" \n \n Also contrary to the militia group's mission to transfer control of public land from the federal government to ranchers, the Paiute argue the refuge land is a part of the tribe's ancestral territory and have refused to meet with the group. \n \n Other members of the community surrounding the wildlife refuge have also denounced the actions of the militia members, many of whom are not from Oregon. Harney County Judge Steve Grasty said he plans to hold leader Ammon Bundy\u2014son of notorious Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy\u2014 responsible for the cost of providing security measures for the refuge, a bill that could be as high as $70,000 a day. \n \n See also: The ranchers at the center of the Oregon standoff \n \n In total, the standoff has cost taxpayers nearly a half million dollars, according to Oregon Gov. Kate Brown. In letters to the White House and Department of Justice this week, Brown requested assistance from the FBI and other law enforcement in removing the militia group from federal land, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. \n \n \"For the citizens of Harney County and indeed all Oregonians, I must insist on a swift resolution to this matter,\" Brown wrote. \"Efforts to negotiate have not been successful, and now it is unclear what steps, if any, federal authorities might take to bring this untenable situation to an end and restore normalcy to this community.\" ||||| Standoff leader posted a video of him looking through artifacts and documents from the Paiute tribe at the Malheur national wildlife refuge, sparking outrage \n \n The militiamen stationed at a federal wildlife refuge in eastern Oregon are now rummaging through artifacts and documents of the Paiute tribe, sparking outrage among local Native Americans whose ancestors originally occupied the land. \n \n LaVoy Finicum, one of the leaders of the armed protesters occupying the Malheur national wildlife refuge, posted a video of himself inside a government building looking through cardboard boxes of papers and other items associated with the local tribe \u2013 and inviting Paiute leaders to meet with the militia and reclaim their belongings. \n \n \u201cWe want to make sure these things are returned to their rightful owner,\u201d said Finicum, who recently helped destroy a US Fish and Wildlife Service fence and remove cameras that he claimed the government was using for surveillance. \n \n The rightwing militia, led by Ammon Bundy, took over the headquarters of the wildlife sanctuary on 2 January to protest the government\u2019s land-use regulations in rural Harney County. They have demanded that local ranchers have control of public lands \u2013 not the federal government. \n \n But days after the occupation began, leaders of the federally recognized Paiute Indian tribe in Burns, the town closest to the refuge, decried the armed occupation, pointing out that the out-of-state militiamen were trying to claim sacred lands that are part of the tribe\u2019s ancestral territory. \n \n \n \n The new video, posted on Wednesday night, has only further enraged tribal leaders who recently called on law enforcement officials to protect native cultural resources at the refuge and to criminally prosecute the militiamen. \n \n \u201cI feel disrespected that they\u2019re even out there,\u201d said Jarvis Kennedy, the tribal council\u2019s sergeant-at-arms. Kennedy said he was too upset to watch all of Finicum\u2019s video. \u201cIt\u2019s like me going through their drawers at their house.\u201d \n \n Tribe leaders and federal officials say the refuge stores confidential documents and thousands of historic artifacts, such as baskets, spears, tools and beads. The refuge is also home to Paiute burial grounds, making the militia\u2019s recent decision to pave a road through the refuge particularly alarming. \n \n \u201cI could go to the Bundys where his grandparents are buried,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cHow would they feel if I drove over their grave and went through their heirlooms?\u201d \n \n In his video, Finicum said that he was showing how the wildlife refuge has done a poor job maintaining the artifacts and keeping storage rooms clean. \u201cThis needs to be taken care of, and so we\u2019re reaching out to the Paiute people in the sincerest manner as we can,\u201d he said on camera. \u201cLet\u2019s make sure that we take care of the heritage of the Native American people.\u201d \n \n Added militia member Blaine Cooper: \u201cThe rightful owners need to come back and claim their belongings.\u201d \n \n But Kennedy said the tribe has a good relationship with refuge officials and noted that the Paiute people refuse to communicate with militia leaders or visit the occupation. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not going to give them the satisfaction of meeting with them,\u201d Charlotte Rodrique, chairwoman of the Burns Paiute tribe, told the Guardian last week. \n \n Kennedy noted that the militiamen have had no trouble leaving and returning to the refuge and feared one of them might damage or steal their artifacts and documents. \u201cAll the stuff they are doing out there, it\u2019s like a crime scene,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce this is done, we\u2019ll see what\u2019s missing.\u201d ||||| This weekend, Burns Paiute tribal chairperson Charlotte Roderique spoke to Indian Country Today Media Network about the status of the occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, \u201cWe are really worried about the status of the artifacts down there.\u201d \n \n On Friday, the tribe delivered a letter to federal agencies including the U.S. Attorney and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service demanding prosecution of Ammon Bundy and other armed militants occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge, \u201cIf the occupiers disturb, damage, remove, alter, or deface any archaeological resource on the refuge property. \n \n There are approximately 4,000 artifacts belonging to the tribe in the buildings the militants are holding. The occupation is entering its third week. \n \n The tribe is demanding federal action under both the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 and a \"protection against bad men\u201d provision in the treaty the tribe signed with the United States in 1868. \n \n Under ARPA, a federal law authorizing law enforcement and penalties in the defense of archeological sites on public land, removing artifacts is a felony offense. First time offenders can be fined up to $20,000 and imprisoned for up to one year. Second time offenders can be fined up to $100,000 and imprisoned for up to 5 years. \n \n Bundy supporters have damaged Native American archaeological sites before, most notably, when they drove ATVs through a canyon trail in Utah in protest of protected federal lands trampling the ruins of homes belonging to the ancient Puebloans. Also, the Southern Paiute tribes in Nevada have accused the Bundy family of defacing ancient Paiute petroglyphs in Gold Butte. Incidentally, Southern Paiute community members held a rally last week in Las Vegas in support of the Burns Paiute tribe. \n \n \u201cI understand they took a bulldozer and built a line around the refuge headquarters,\u201d Roderique said. She notes that in the past when a water line was put in at the refuge the tribe\u2019s cultural resources department oversaw the work done to make sure no artifacts or sites were disturbed. \u201cWe have a good working relationship with them. That is, the relationship has evolved for the better.\u201d \n \n The community has also reached out to her, \u201cI\u2019ve gotten calls from ranching families who support the tribe. They\u2019ve seen the [Paiute] campsites out there. They\u2019ve been in that area and they know where things are. You can\u2019t go and bulldoze things. I don\u2019t know what these people are doing if they are doing things to just get a rise or to be martyr\u2014all they are doing is making enemies out of the people they professed to support.\u201d \n \n Carla Burnside, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's archaeologist at the refuge, has told the tribe that she has seen pictures in news reports of militants sitting in her office, even at her desk with files open that contain sensitive information about archaeological sites belonging to the tribe. \n \n This past week, the Burns Paiute tribal council passed a resolution to formally recognize Malheur Lake and its shoreline as \u201cSacred Places and Traditional Cultural Properties\u201d of the tribe and cited the tribe\u2019s own \u201cAboriginal Lands Protection Policy\u201d which covers \u201cthe tribe's aboriginal territory beyond current Trust lands (Resolution 2006-12) which defines cultural resources as: \u2018any material objects of human life or activities that are of cultural, historical, archaeological, sacred, spiritual, or traditional interest to the tribe. This shall include all remains, sites, objects, structures, artifacts, implements, plants, animals, and locations within the tribe's aboriginal territory.\u2019\u201d \n \n Occupation leader Ammon Bundy, from Arizona and son of Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher involved in a standoff with the federal government over $1 million in unpaid grazing fees on public land, has offered to meet with the tribe but the tribe says he has no right to hold their history hostage and have refused to grant him even the appearance of such authority by meeting with him. \n \n \u201cSome of the members of the community were open to them,\u201d Roderique says, \u201cwhen they first came but now the county chained and locked everything up and said no you can\u2019t have your meeting in town.\u201d \n \n Harney County officials have stated they will not allow the militants to use any county-owned building for fear of more takeovers of public property. \n \n \u201cThey tried to ask us for our gathering center and our facility was booked up. We just kind of laughed and said they want to use our 'savage' facilities?\u201d \n \n Roderique was referencing a \u201cHarney County Committee of Safety\u201d website made by supporters of the takeover who profess to exist \u201cto secure the property and lives of the association members from threats from the savages.\u201d \n \n The support, however, has been \u201coverwhelming\u201d says Roderique. The tribe has received letters of support from other tribes like the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs and the Klamath tribe of Northern California and even farther away from First Nations tribes in Canada and many Native American organizations and Mexican American organizations. \n \n \u201cThose things are so empowering. When we had our press conference we didn\u2019t know the attendance and response was going to be as big as it was. I really appreciate all the Native people for their concern because it could be any one of us that this could happen to.\u201d \n \n Roderique told ICTMN that it is not only title to the land that matters to her but the plants and wildlife on the land some of which are going extinct. \u201cWe are the Wadatika people. The plants we are named after grow on the banks of the Harney and Malheur lake. If they put cattle in there [Bundy has called for the land to be returned to private ranchers] they will destroy these plants.\u201d \n \n \u201cAs a little girl, we\u2019d go along the river in the marshes and gather waterfowl to eat in the spring. We\u2019d make our little tule baskets. I was told by elders if there are three eggs, take one. Leave the other two. One is going to grow up and fulfill its life. One is going to be taken by predators. So you never just go and throw all the eggs in your basket, you only, only take one. Find another nest and find another one. That way there was continuation of the species. Our people have been doing that for thousands of years and those are the things that are taught to the next generation. We restrict our hunting and gathering accordingly to ensure there is a future. We don\u2019t have the attitude that the Bundys have.\u201d \n \n This weekend, the first occupier was arrested in Burns at a Safeway for theft of a government vehicle and another cited for driving without a driver\u2019s license when the government van he was driving on icy roads overturned. And last week, Bundy\u2019s personal bodyguard \u201cFluffy Unicorn\u201d was arrested in Arizona for an outstanding warrant. \n \n A protest is planned in Portland, Oregon on Tuesday against the illegal occupation by environmental groups including the Portland Audubon and the Center for Biological Diversity. \n \n Jacqueline Keeler is a Navajo/Yankton Dakota Sioux writer living in Portland, Oregon and co-founder of Eradicating Offensive Native Mascotry, creators of Not Your Mascot.

It's like me going through their drawers at their house,\" says Jarvis Kennedy, the tribal council's sergeant-at-arms. \"How would they feel if I drove over their grave and went through their heirlooms?\" he adds. Though he fears some artifacts will be stolen, Kennedy gave no indication that he would go pick them up. \"All the stuff they are doing out there, it's like a crime scene,\" he says. \"Once this is done, we'll see what's missing.\" Last week, the tribe asked federal agencies to prosecute occupiers who \"disturb, damage, remove, alter, or deface any archaeological resource on the refuge property,\" per Indian Country Today Media Network."

    "input": "A malfunction during the most recent test flight of the private spacecraft SpaceShipTwo sent the vehicle hurtling out of control until its crew could stabilize the craft for a safe landing. \n \n The issue provided some heart-stopping moments for its airborne crew and ground handlers, but also allowed the vehicle's owner, Virgin Galactic, to showcase the craft's safety features. \n \n The commercial space plane made its 16th glide flight on Sept. 29, following a hiatus for hangar work. For the first time, SpaceShipTwo carried a three-person crew \u2014 two pilots and a flight test engineer. [ Gallery \u2014 SpaceShipTwo Makes First Glide Flight ] \n \n To begin, SpaceShipTwo was lifted to high altitude by its carrier plane, WhiteKnightTwo. After a clean release from WhiteKnightTwo, SpaceShipTwo immediately entered a rapid descent. Springing into action, the crew deployed the ship's novel feather re-entry system. \n \n SpaceShipTwo's ability to feather its tail section is a safety feature that increases the vehicle's stability during atmospheric re-entry. Akin to the flight of a shuttlecock in badminton, the feather system allows SpaceShipTwo to rely on aerodynamics and the laws of physics to control speed and altitude. \n \n The glide flight lasted a brief 7 minutes and 15 seconds. \n \n Downward pitch rate \n \n \"Upon release, the spaceship experienced a downward pitch rate that caused a stall of the tails. The crew followed procedure, selecting the feather mode to revert to a benign condition. The crew then de-feathered and had a nominal return to base,\" according to an updated flight log posted by Scaled Composites, builder of the WhiteKnightTwo /SpaceShipTwo launch system. \n \n Scaled Composites is constructing the private spaceship fleet for Virgin Galactic, a spaceline company for suborbital space tourism backed by U.K. entrepreneur Richard Branson. \n \n \"Great flying by the team and good demo of feather system,\" Scaled officials wrote in the flight log. \n \n According to one observer of the craft's rapid descent, \"It dropped like a rock and went straight down. Typically, it takes 11 minutes to land, but this time it was only seven minutes before they were on the ground. It was a nail-biter \u2026 but that's how you learn.\" \n \n Flight envelope \n \n George Whitesides, Virgin Galactic's chief executive officer and president, said the glide flight included a third seat flight test engineer onboard SpaceShipTwo for the first time. \"A good capability for us to have for this phase of test,\" he told SPACE.com. \"Yes, apparently the tails exhibited stall characteristics in the test \u2014 which was a steep nose down maneuver.\" \n \n Whitesides confirmed that SpaceShipTwo was ultimately able to carry out a nominal landing. \n \n \"Scaled is looking at the data now, but doesn't anticipate any major issues,\" Whitesides said. \"This is why we flight test, to fully explore the aerodynamic flight envelope.\" \n \n NASA shuttle leader joins team \n \n Meanwhile, in other Virgin Galactic news, the company has announced the appointment of former NASA executive Mike Moses as its new vice president of operations. \n \n Moses' NASA career included serving at the NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida as the launch integration manager from 2008 until the landing of the final space shuttle mission in July 2011. He was responsible for supervising all shuttle processing activities from landing through launch, and for reviewing major milestones, including final readiness for flight. \n \n According to a Virgin Galactic statement, Moses will develop and lead the team responsible for Virgin Galactic spaceship operations and logistics, flight crew operations, customer training and spaceport ground operations, primarily focusing on overall operational safety and risk management. \n \n Leonard David has been reporting on the space industry for more than five decades. He is a winner of this year's National Space Club Press Award and a past editor-in-chief of the National Space Society's Ad Astra and Space World magazines. He has written for SPACE.com since 1999. ||||| Las Cruces, N.M., officially joined the list of the nation\u2019s major space centers Monday when a newly completed terminal and hangar facility was turned over to British billionaire Richard Branson and his commercial space tourism venture, Virgin Galactic. \n \n The company aims to launch paying customers beyond Earth\u2019s confines from the new $209-million futuristic-looking facility, named Spaceport America. \n \n New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez joined Branson and a crowd of more than 800 others during the dedication ceremonies. \n \n \u201cToday is another history-making day for Virgin Galactic,\u201d Branson said at the event. \u201cWe are here with a group of incredible people who are helping us lead the way in creating one of the most important new industrial sectors of the 21st century.\u201d \n \n Virgin Galactic said it has taken about 455 reservations for the ride. The price per flight for a would-be space tourist is $200,000. \n \n Instead of launching people directly into space with a rocket, Virgin Galactic plans to do the following: A rocket plane with six passengers will be attached to the wings of a White Knight mother ship, flown to 50,000 feet and released. The rocket plane's engine then will ignite and propel the passengers into suborbit. \n \n The spaceship is designed to climb to the edge of space, about 60 miles above the Earth's surface. At that suborbital altitude, people experience weightlessness and see the curvature of the Earth. \n \n Virgin Galactic\u2019s sleek carrier aircraft and spaceships are made by the Spaceship Co. in Mojave, where the planes are currently undergoing test flights. Branson hopes to make its first passenger flight with his adult children, Sam and Holly, as soon as next year. \n \n At the end of Monday\u2019s event, the Branson trio --after rappelling down the side of the Spaceport\u2019s massive glass windows -- named one of the ground terminals the Virgin Galactic Gateway to Space. \n \n The gateway will house preparation facilities for company\u2019s passengers, which it calls astronauts. There is also a mission control center and an area for friends and family. \n \n RELATED: \n \n Virgin Galactic signs deal to give NASA rides into space \n \n Firm completes spacecraft factory in Mojave \n \n Virgin Galactic makes first feathered flight over Mojave [Video] \n \n -- W.J.

It\u2019s time for another voice.\u201d \n \n After months of wrangling, the current package of Senate legislation would expand background checks for gun buyers, increase penalties for people who buy firearms for those barred from owning them and would give law enforcement new tools to combat illegal gun trafficking, a longtime goal of Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s. \n \n Given the mayor\u2019s role in contributing to the ouster of an N.R.A.-backed candidate in an Illinois Congressional race a few weeks ago, his push carries an unmistakable threat to those who vote against the bills. \n \n The ads are directed at Democratic and Republican senators in both swing states and partisan precincts. Among Mr. Bloomberg\u2019s targets are some of the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Democrats, including Kay R. Hagan of North Carolina, Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark L. Pryor of Arkansas, for whom the gun issue is particularly problematic because they will need Republican votes to win re-election. \n \n Some of the senators, such as Dean Heller of Nevada, Rob Portman of Ohio and Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, all Republicans, represent swing states where voters are divided over guns. Other Republicans would seem to be out of reach for Mr. Bloomberg: Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Daniel Coats of Indiana and Jeff Flake of Arizona. \n \n In each case, the commercials urge support for the measure requiring background checks for nearly all firearms purchases, not just those in gun stores, the most debated element of the legislation and a coveted goal of gun control advocates. \n \n Photo \n \n Mr. Bloomberg has singled out Mr. Flake, who already voted against the expansion of background checks in the Senate Judiciary Committee, by producing a special, scolding commercial aimed at Arizona. \u201cFlake\u2019s vote,\u201d the ad declares, equals \u201cno background checks for dangerous criminals.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n The mayor, who has spent tens of millions of dollars to support his favored candidates, intends to wield his \u201csuper PAC\u201d to influence the midterm Congressional elections next year and beyond.

Cox, the group\u2019s chief lobbyist. \u201cNo one can. We don\u2019t have to.\u201d \n \n He predicted that voters and senators would resist a message from an out-of-state magnate who is associated with government limits on soda and salt. \n \n \u201cWhat he is going to find out is that Americans don\u2019t want to be told by some elitist billionaire what they can eat, drink and they damn well don\u2019t want to be told how, when and where they can protect their families,\u201d Mr. Cox said. \n \n Thomas E.

President Obama has called for bold action, and former Representative Gabrielle Giffords has lent her personal story to the cause. \n \n Still, what they are now fighting for is, by the admission of gun control advocates, a diminished version of what they wanted \u2014 and even that is proving a tough sell. \n \n \u201cThese ideas shouldn\u2019t be controversial,\u201d the president said in his radio address on Saturday. \n \n Mr. Bloomberg lamented that \u201csausage and the law aren\u2019t pretty the way they are made.\u201d \n \n But he is eager to seize what he can. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got as good a chance as we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d the mayor said.",

We're looking at laws that beef up the penalties on straw purchases and illegal trafficking, which we want prosecuted.\" Karl Rove: \"Let's be clear about this. This is prompted by the Sandy Hook murders. Those guns were legally purchased with a background check. Let's be very careful before trampling on the rights of people. If you want to get something done, then stop scaring people.\" California AG Kamala Harris: \"The folks in DC have to reject a false choice that suggests that you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or that you're in favor of reasonable and common sense gun laws. You can be both. I as a career prosecutor have personally seen cases of both police officers and innocent babies being killed by assault weapons. There is no reasonable basis for having those on our streets.\" Mike Rogers on Syria's chemical weapons: It's \"abundantly clear that red line has been crossed. Now is the time.\" Yet, \"if Assad goes next week, this is mass chaos.\" Bloomberg on President Obama's Israel trip: \"I think this is going to go down in history as one of the few trips that an American president has made to Israel where there really were deliverables. He got Israel and Turkey talking to each other and restoring diplomatic relations. And I think that's crucial for the security of that whole area.\" Rand Paul on 2016: \"The country is suffering, 12 million people out of work. So I want to be part of the answers to it. Whether or not that actually is me specifically running for president, I don't know that yet.\""

The order calls for an examination of the Postal Service\u2019s pricing, policies and workforce costs. \n \n The Postal Service has lost more than $65 billion over the past decade as Americans increasingly transmit messages online, according to the executive order. The task force will be led by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin or his designee, according to the order. \n \n Amazon.com packages at a USPS sorting center. Photographer: Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg \n \n In a series of Twitter messages, Trump has accused Amazon of draining the Postal Service of money it can\u2019t afford to lose. Trump\u2019s sustained attacks on one of the world\u2019s largest companies have hurt Amazon\u2019s stock price and raised questions about government interference in the private sector. \n \n A White House official said the presidential order was intended to come up with solutions to the problems at the Postal Service. The official didn\u2019t deny that the task force\u2019s recommendations could affect Amazon. A second White House official disputed the notion that the order was directed at Amazon, and also said that the task force was charged with improving the mail service. \n \n Both officials were granted anonymity, to discuss administration deliberations. \n \n Read more: How the Post Office Makes Amazon a Federal Issue \n \n Amazon declined to comment. \n \n Trump has claimed that Amazon was \u201ccosting the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,\u201d a situation that puts \u201cmany thousands of retailers out of business.\u201d He repeated a claim that the postal service loses \u201c$1.50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon\u201d and said \u201conly fools, or worse\u201d believe the Postal Service makes money from doing business with Amazon. \n \n Amazon\u2019s founder, Jeff Bezos, also owns the Washington Post, which has aggressively covered the Trump administration. \n \n Since signing a landmark five-year contract in 2013 to deliver packages on Sundays, Amazon and the Postal Service have declared their business relationship a success, although the terms of the contract are confidential. \n \n \u2018Last Mile\u2019 \n \n The Postal Service says it makes money on the Amazon deal, and it\u2019s legally prohibited from charging shippers less than its delivery costs. E-commerce revenue provides \u201cessential support to pay for the network and infrastructure that enables us to fulfill our universal service obligation,\u201d David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, wrote in a January op-ed. \u201cAll users of the mail benefit.\u201d \n \n Amazon regularly uses the Postal Service to complete what\u2019s called the \u201clast mile\u201d of delivery, with letter carriers dropping off packages at some 150 million residences and businesses daily. The company has a network of 35 \u201csort center\u201d where customer packages are sorted by ZIP code, stacked on pallets and delivered to post offices for the final leg of delivery. \n \n \u201cAmazon has the money to pay the fair rate at the Post Office, which would be much more than they\u2019re paying now,\u201d Trump said to reporters at the White House earlier this month. \u201cAmazon is going to have to pay much more money to the Post Office, there\u2019s no doubt about that.\u201d \n \n The executive order requires the commission to examine \u201cthe expansion and pricing of the package delivery market and the USPS\u2019s role in competitive markets.\u201d \n \n Previous Studies \n \n It\u2019s not clear what effect the task force would ultimately have, since most changes to the Postal Service\u2019s business structure would require new legislation. The Postal Service is an independent organization and its mail rates are set by a commission. \n \n The task force will be looking at issues that have been studied for years by multiple government bodies that have already issued recommendations and reports focusing on the financial stability of the Postal Service. \n \n For example, Trump\u2019s executive order requires the task force to review the definition of the \u201cuniversal service obligation,\u201d which is a loosely defined mandate for the Postal Service to provide affordable service to all customers. \n \n The Post Service\u2019s Office of Inspector General issued a report in 2014 with recommendations for redefining the obligation in the digital age. In 2016, the same office released a report with recommendations for financing the mandate. \n \n The task force will be required to submit a report to the president within 120 days with recommendations for \u201cadministrative and legislative reforms,\u201d according to the order. \n \n \u2014 With assistance by Jennifer Jacobs, Ben Brody, and Olivia Zaleski ||||| \"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.\" \n \n President Donald Trump took a swing at Amazon once more on April 2, blaming the digital retailer for the United States Postal Service\u2019s financial woes. \n \n \"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon,\" Trump tweeted. \"THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field!\" \n \n Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed. Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country...not a level playing field! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2018 \n \n We addressed the closing of retailers across the country in another Amazon-USPS tweet-inspired story last week. (Trump had a point.) But for this fact-check, we wondered whether Amazon is causing the Postal Service to \"lose a fortune.\" \n \n The post office is losing a fortune, but Trump is wrong to blame Amazon. \n \n Parcels are growing the Postal Service \n \n The Postal Service reported a net loss of $2.7 billion for 2017. It has lost $65.1 billion since 2007. Much of the red ink is attributed to a 2006 law mandating that USPS pre-fund future retirees\u2019 health benefits. \n \n First-class mail, the USPS\u2019 biggest source of revenue, also continued to shrink, seeing a $1.87 billion revenue loss in fiscal year 2017. \n \n Package delivery, however, was one of the few bright spots in its latest financial statement. In 2017, parcels brought in $19.5 billion, or 28 percent of USPS\u2019 annual revenue. At $2.1 billion, packages contributed the largest revenue increase. \n \n Deals with private shippers like Amazon accounted for $7 billion of the $19.5 billion in revenue. While we know that Amazon is the biggest e-commerce player, we don\u2019t know exactly how much of the $7 billion comes from Amazon, because the details of the postal service\u2019s deals with private shippers are considered proprietary and not made public. \n \n A good deal? \n \n USPS ships about 40 percent of Amazon\u2019s packages. Amazon bulk-delivers packages to a USPS distribution center, and the Postal Service brings it to your door. USPS negotiates the discounted rate for that service with Amazon, as it does all other bulk shippers. \n \n Those rates are kept under wraps. That said, we do know the Amazon deal is at least a break-even venture. \n \n That\u2019s because the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act made it illegal for USPS to price parcel delivery below its cost. \n \n \"By law our competitive package products, including those that we deliver for Amazon, must cover their costs,\" an August 2017 USPS press release said. \"Our regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission (PRC), looks carefully at this question every year and has determined that they do. The PRC has also noted that competitive products help fund the infrastructure of the Postal Service.\" \n \n In fact, the Postal Regulatory Commission gave the green light to the USPS-Amazon deal the same day Trump began tweeting about Amazon last week. \n \n Trump might have a point, however, in saying the USPS could be making more money off Amazon. For example, Citigroup found that on average, USPS was charging $1.46 below market rates for parcel delivery (not just to Amazon). \n \n Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers, explained the Postal Service can offer lower prices than their private competitors because they already \"go to every house, every day.\" \n \n \"We\u2019re already going there to deliver mail and bills and advertising, so the marginal cost of delivering an extra package is not high, especially in the low-density areas,\" Sauber said. \n \n Our ruling \n \n Trump tweeted, \"Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon. THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.\" \n \n Amazon isn\u2019t causing the United States Postal Service to lose a fortune. In fact, it\u2019s contributing to its biggest growth sector, package delivery. Deals like the one with Amazon brought in $7 billion in fiscal year 2017. \n \n While we don\u2019t know the deal USPS crafted with Amazon, we know it\u2019s not losing money. A 2006 law codified profitability into law, and an independent regulatory commission that reviews their deals annually gave it a green light on March 29. \n \n That said, it\u2019s possible that the Postal Service could be charging Amazon more for package delivery and therefore get a better deal. That still doesn\u2019t mean USPS is losing a fortune. \n \n We rate this claim False.",
    "reference": "\u2013 President Trump has railed against Amazon repeatedly in recent weeks, accusing Jeff Bezos' company of getting a sweetheart deal from the Postal Service on delivery. On Thursday night, the president took what could be his first tangible step toward changing that: He issued an executive order calling for a review of the agency's finances, reports Bloomberg. The order, which does not mention Amazon, notes the USPS has lost more than $65 billion over the last decade. \"The USPS is on an unsustainable financial path and must be restructured to prevent a taxpayer-funded bailout,\" the order reads. An analysis at Politifact disputes Trump's previous assertions that the delivery deal with Amazon, whose terms are confidential, is costing the USPS money. (\"I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy,\" Trump wrote on April 3.) Instead, it chalks up most of the agency's red ink to a 2006 law requiring USPS to prefund the health benefits of retirees. (One other way Trump could change policy at USPS: Start filling numerous vacancies on its board of governors.)"

The Via manufacturing business, Starbucks' only roasting facility in Colombia, will be expanded to roast espresso blends and packaged coffee for sale in the country. \n \n \"We want to sell Colombian coffee in Colombia,\" said Craig Russell, Starbucks' senior vice president of global coffee. \n \n The USAID-Starbucks program will be directed at farmers in Antioquia, Tolima, Huila and Cauca, rich coffee-growing areas where there is still a FARC presence. \n \n A major aim of the initiative is to reduce \"extreme poverty, which is still a reality for almost all of these small-scale coffee growers that have barely one hectare (2.5 acres) of land,\" said USAID chief Raj Shah. \n \n Carlos Piedrahita, head of Nutresa, said Starbucks' entrance into Colombia's coffee shop market would mean investment and jobs. \n \n \"This means more demand for our national produce,\" said Piedrahita, speaking at a press conference in Bogota alongside Schultz. \n \n Starbucks said its research suggests the cost of the chain's beverages, known for being relatively expensive around the world, won't deter consumers. The company declined to reveal its Colombia pricing, citing competitiveness. \n \n Schultz said Starbucks would not undercut the country's farmer-owned Juan Valdez chain and probably charge a little more to create Starbucks \"home-from-home\" lounge environment. He emphasized the company wanted to make a \"respectful\" entry into a country that has been a key coffee supplier for many years. \n \n (Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton in Washington DC and Peter Murphy in Bogota; editing by Andrew Hay) ||||| After buying coffee from Colombia for almost half a century, Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) is finally opening a cafe there, part of its accelerating expansion in Latin America. \n \n The world\u2019s largest coffee-shop operator will open a cafe in Bogota in the first half of next year and then five more locations later in 2014, Chief Executive Officer Howard Schultz said in a telephone interview. The stores will be operated through a joint venture between Alsea SAB (ALSEA*) and Grupo Nutresa SA (NUTRESA), and will sell locally sourced and roasted espresso and coffee. \n \n \u201cThis is long overdue,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cThere is tremendous enthusiasm as we talk to people and walk the streets -- most of these Colombian people we talked to have consumed Starbucks coffee somewhere else.\u201d \n \n It would be disappointing if Starbucks didn\u2019t have 50 stores in Colombia in five years, Schultz said at a press event in Bogota today. \n \n Starbucks is expanding to countries with growing middle classes to help boost sales. The Seattle-based company, which has about 8,000 cafes outside the U.S., opened its first locations in India in 2012 and Vietnam this year. In Colombia, Starbucks will compete with chains such as Juan Valdez Cafe, whose parent company Procafecol SA was created in 2002 by the Colombian Coffee Growers Federation. \n \n Alsea, based in Mexico City, earlier this year acquired parts of Starbucks Argentina and Chile that it didn\u2019t already own. Alsea, which operates Domino\u2019s Pizza Inc. (DPZ) and Burger King Worldwide Inc. (BKW) stores in Latin America, will have a 70 percent stake in Starbucks operations in Colombia. Grupo Nutresa, based in Medellin, Colombia, is the nation\u2019s largest publicly traded food company. \n \n USAID Agreement \n \n Starbucks also is forming a pact with the U.S. Agency for International Development to invest $3 million to secure coffee quality and supply in certain regions of Colombia. Starbucks and USAID are each investing $1.5 million during the next three years for research to help small-plot coffee farmers in Colombia. The money will go to Starbucks\u2019s farmer support center in Manizales to pay for agronomists to analyze soil and advise growers on factors that affect yield, such as climate, pests and fertilizers. \n \n Colombia has been Starbucks\u2019s largest or second-largest coffee-bean supplier in its 42-year history, Schultz said during an earlier interview. In 2012, Starbucks bought about 545 million pounds of coffee from 29 countries, about 27 percent more than it bought the previous year, according to the company\u2019s annual global responsibility report. \n \n Recently, the company has invested in countries where it buys beans to help secure supply and consistent quality as it opens more locations. Earlier this year, Starbucks bought a farm in Costa Rica to experiment with coffee varieties and expand its grower-support program. \n \n Farmer Support \n \n Starbucks opened its first farmer support center in 2004 in Costa Rica. Last year, it opened branches in Colombia and China for agronomists to help local coffee growers improve the quality and size of their harvests. The cafe operator has said it wants to sell all ethically sourced coffee by 2015. \n \n USAID has initiated other projects to help areas in Colombia affected by internal conflict, drug trafficking and violence. Last year, the government agency began working on a program to increase access to renewable energy in the South American nation. \n \n Starbucks, which has about 19,200 stores worldwide, has gained 34 percent this year. The Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 Index has advanced 16 percent. \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Leslie Patton in Chicago at lpatton5@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Robin Ajello at rajello@bloomberg.net",

He was stunned by the tragedy that has struck his family. He says Craig discovered the bodies Thursday night when he came home from work. \n \n \"To the best I understand, he walked in, the house was all in disorder and walked in and found them both,\" RIddle says. \n \n The medical examiner's office says the bodies were found in a bed. \n \n \"It's puzzling what happened,\" says neighbor Eric Tivnan. He and other neighbors are trying to figure out if they, too, should be concerned for their safety. Police did not say whether it appeared to be a home invasion.

Police went on later Friday to say they were not looking at one specific person as a suspect, and that they hadn't ruled anyone out. \n \n All of it has left the family devastated and dumbfounded. \n \n \"A new mother, a three-month-old baby... why?

SIGN ME UP! \n \n Bail on the warrant is set at $1 million. \n \n Vandewege called 911 on the night of Dec. 15 to report that he had come home to find his wife, Shanna Riddle Vandewege, and their 3-month-old son, Diederik, dead in the home in the 8500 block of Cactus Flower Drive. \n \n The necks of the mother and baby \u2014 who were found in their beds \u2014 had been cut, and their deaths were ruled homicides. \n \n Homicide Sgt. Joe Loughman would not disclose Thursday what evidence investigators have linking Vandewege to the slayings. \n \n Vandewege had reportedly gone to Colorado to attend the pair\u2019s funeral service. \n \n A report obtained by the Star-Telegram details his encounter with Glenwood Springs police late Wednesday as follows: \n \n Glenwood Springs police were dispatched to a 7-Eleven about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday after a caller reported that a man had stated he was on the run from police and had gotten into a white Hyundai with no front license plate. \n \n The caller told dispatchers that the man, whom he identified as \u201cCraig Allen,\u201d had borrowed his phone to call a few people to talk about a murder. He gave the direction the man was heading. \n \n Shortly after 11 p.m., an officer spotted a similar vehicle with no rear license plate. The officer followed the car, watching as it pulled into a Shell gas station. The officer saw the male driver get out of the car, retrieve a license plate from the trunk and screw it onto the license plate holder. \n \n The driver then got back into the car and drove away, accelerating rapidly, the report states. \n \n After clocking the car traveling 37 mph in a 25-mph zone, the officer pulled over the Hyundai, which now showed a rear Texas license plate. \n \n Vandewege told the officer that he didn\u2019t realize he was speeding and that he was headed to Las Vegas. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s been a long week, my wife and kid were murdered in Texas,\u201d Vandewege is quoted in the report as telling the officers. \n \n He then handed the officers an attorney\u2019s contract for services, telling them they could call his attorney if they needed to verify what he was telling them. \n \n \u201cHe stated that his wife and son were murdered in Ft Worth, Tx. He was showing no emotion while telling this\u201d to the officer, the report states. \n \n Glenwood Springs contacted Fort Worth police, who advised that Vandewege had not been ruled out as a suspect in his wife and child\u2019s slaying, had \u201cfled the area\u201d and hadn\u2019t had contact with investigators since, the report states. \n \n Glenwood Springs police asked Vandewege to step out of his car after he presented them with an expired insurance card, but he responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not getting out.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis went on for approximately 5 minutes and he finally agreed to get out of the vehicle,\u201d the report states. \n \n Vandewege was then handcuffed. Asked if he had any knives on him, Vandewege reportedly told the officer, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a knife guy.\u201d \n \n Police did find two loaded pistols on Vandewege \u2014 one in a waistband holder and one in an ankle holster. Vandewege presented officers with a concealed handgun permit issued in Weld County, Colo. \n \n \u201cI did not observe a wedding band on Craig\u2019s left ring finger, but he stated a wedding ring was in his pocket along with numerous condoms,\u201d the report states. \n \n Vandewege was taken to jail and his car was impounded. Inside the vehicle, police located numerous boxes of different caliber ammunition, empty gas cans, camouflage clothing, numerous bottles of medication, an AR-15-style rifle and a .22-caliber revolver. \n \n The couple moved to Fort Worth earlier this year from Colorado. Vandewege worked at a Costco, and his wife was a registered nurse at a hospital. \n \n Mark Riddle, Shanna Vandewege\u2019s father, has said that his daughter had previously suffered three miscarriage and that the pair were ecstatic with the birth of their first child. She was on maternity leave when she and the baby were killed. \n \n Before the capital murder warrant was issued, Riddle had expressed support for his son-in-law in a comment made on a Star-Telegram article, calling other comments left by readers \u201cdetrimental\u201d to his daughter\u2019s husband and \u201chis innocence.\u201d \n \n \u201cI believe in him and so do all of the other family members and friends gathered,\u201d Riddle wrote. \u201cUntil you have had to deal with the mixed emotions that we\u2019ve been experiencing since this episode, do not be judgmental lest you be judged.\u201d",

Vandewege had just three joyful months with her boy: The 36-year-old and her baby were found dead by way of \"incised wounds\" to the neck in their Fort Worth home on Dec. 15, reports WFAA. Husband Craig Vandewege called 911 after discovering their bodies\u2014and has now been arrested for their murders. Craig Vandewege initially told police he found them in the master bedroom upon coming home from work. \"To the best I understand, he walked in, the house was all in disorder,\" Shanna Vandewege's father initially said. The deaths sparked fears in the Texas neighborhood they had moved to earlier this year from Colorado. The latter state is where Craig Vandewege was ultimately arrested, initially for speeding and not providing proof of insurance while in Glenwood Springs. He was in the state for his family's funerals. A capital murder warrant was obtained Thursday, reports the Star-Telegram, but no information regarding evidence or motive has been revealed. One detail from the arrest report: \"I did not observe a wedding band on Craig\u2019s left ring finger, but he stated a wedding ring was in his pocket along with numerous condoms.\" Police found two pistols, an AR-15-style rifle, a .22-caliber revolver, camouflage clothing, and ammunition on his person and in the car. Shanna Vandewege was a nurse who was on maternity leave; her husband worked at Costco. (In another case, police say a man killed his wife, his son, and himself, but a surviving daughter isn't so sure.)"

It's possible the writer of the tablet's riddles lived within this kingdom. The tablet's current location is unknown. \n \n Millennia before modern-day Americans made fun of their politicians or cracked crude jokes over a cold one, people in ancient Mesopotamia were doing much the same thing. \n \n The evidence of sex, politics and beer-drinking comes from a newly translated tablet, dating back more than 3,500 years, which reveals a series of riddles. \n \n The text is fragmentary in parts and appears to have been written by an inexperienced hand, possibly a student. The researchers aren't sure where the tablet originates, though they suspect its scribe lived in the southern part of Mesopotamia, near the Persian Gulf. \n \n The translation, by Nathan Wasserman, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem's Institute of Archaeology, and Michael Streck, a professor with the Altorientalisches Institut at Universit\u00e4t Leipzig, is detailed in the most recent edition of the journal Iraq. [In Photos: Ancient Riddles Decoded] \n \n Rare riddles \n \n The text was written in Akkadian, using cuneiform script. It was a language commonly used by the Babylonians, along with other ancient kingdoms in the Middle East. \n \n \"This is a relatively rare genre \u2014 we don't have many riddles,\" Wasserman told LiveScience in an interview, referring to riddles written in the Akkadian language. \n \n Unfortunately, researchers are not certain where the tablet is presently located. In 1976, it was housed in the Iraq Museum in Baghdad. At that time, a scholar named J.J. van Dijk published a copy of the Akkadian inscription, which the researchers used for their translation. \n \n Since 1976, Iraq has been through three wars and, during the 2003 invasion, the museum was pillaged. \"We tried to figure out where the tablet is now, [but] I don't know,\" Wasserman said. He added that the tablet is small and not very impressive-looking, something that a looter may take a pass on, \"I very much hope that it is still there,\" Wasserman said. [10 Battles for the Control of Iraq] \n \n Political humor \n \n Some of the decoded riddles are crude and sexual, while others are complex and metaphorical. One of them reveals what appears to be a bit of political humor, albeit with a dark, violent twist. \n \n He gouged out the eye: \n \n It is not the fate of a dead man. \n \n He cut the throat: A dead man (-Who is it?) \n \n The answer is a governor. \n \n \"This riddle describes the power of a governor namely to act as a judge who punishes or sentences to death,\" write Streck and Wasserman in the journal article. \n \n Wasserman has seen examples in other Akkadian texts of people criticizing their leaders. \"We have some interesting traces of political criticism, and [I] might say even say political anger,\" he said. \"It could be a kind of political humor expressed in this governor riddle.\" \n \n While the governor riddle reflects a sort of gallows' humor, others are much lighter. \n \n In(?) your mouth and your teeth (or: your urine) \n \n constantly stared at you \n \n the measuring vessel of your lord (-What is it?) \n \n The answer, it appears, is beer. \n \n Crude and lewd \n \n Politics and beer were not the only things the scribe commented on. Two of the riddles, now in a fragmentary state, are sexual, crude and difficult to understand. \n \n One of them, whose translation is uncertain, reads: \n \n The deflowered (girl) did not become pregnant \n \n The undeflowered (girl) became pregnant (-What is it?) \n \n The answer, strangely enough, appears to be \"auxiliary forces,\" a group of soldiers that tend not to be reliable. \n \n Wasserman said that the meaning of this riddle eludes him. \"I don't understand what is really going on,\" he said, adding that auxiliary forces are often below-average soldiers, \"and they are not really trustworthy, sometimes they run away in the middle of the battle.\" \n \n Another riddle, this one even more fragmentary and whose translation is uncertain, is also very crude. \n \n ... of your mother \n \n is by the one who has intercourse (with her) (-What/who is it?) \n \n The researchers aren't sure of the riddle's solution since the answer has been lost. \n \n Ancient metaphor \n \n One of the riddles appears to rely on metaphor to get its point across. \n \n The tower is high \n \n it is high, but nonetheless has no shade (- What is it?) \n \n The answer is sunlight. \n \n \"You have to think about the riddle like the 'Lord of the Rings' or 'The Hobbit'; it is metaphor,\" Wasserman said. Imagine you are outside and see a beam of light going from sky to Earth. [Science Fact or Fantasy? 20 Imaginary Worlds] \n \n \"It looks like a tower, but it gives no shade, of course, because it's light itself,\u201d Wasserman said. \"The answer is the proof for its own validity.\" \n \n The last riddle relies on logic: \n \n (Note the translation of the first line is uncertain) \n \n Like a fish in a fish pond \n \n Like troops before the king (-What is it?) \n \n The answer is a broken bow. \n \n \n \n Archery was widely used in the ancient world for both warfare and hunting. If your bow was broken you would be able to do neither. Credit: steve estvanik shutterstock \n \n Archery was widely used in the ancient world for both warfare and hunting.

Also \"a fish in a fish pond is not really helpful if you are hungry,\" Wasserman said. A broken bow is useless as well, \"a broken bow is not really helpful if you need to go to war or to hunt a deer.\" \n \n The researchers emphasized in their paper that the number of surviving Akkadian riddles from this time period is \"very small\" and, overall, this tablet provides a rare opportunity to explore this genre of ancient writing. \n \n Follow LiveScience for the latest in science news and discoveries on Twitter @livescience and on Facebook. ||||| Around 1,500 BCE, a student in ancient Babylon inscribed six riddles on a tablet. 3,500 years later, these proto-jokes lose a lot in the translation, but one thing's for sure: the Babylonians are saying something about your mother. \n \n The tablet in question was first discovered back in 1976 by an archaeologist named J.J. van Dijk during excavations in present-day Iraq. Sadly, the tablet itself has since disappeared, but van Dijk left behind a copy of what the tablet had to say, as well as the delightfully pissy assertion that the tablet featured \"very careless writing\" and so was obviously the work of a student. \n \n The tablet features a half-dozen riddles, which researchers Nathan Wasserman and Michael Streck recently analyzed for the journal Iraq. Though they call the tablet an example of \"wisdom literature,\" meaning these the riddles were metaphors meant to impart pithy little truths. And while there's definitely an aspect of that, at least a few of the riddles sound like some very early stabs at comedy. Take this one for example: \n \n Advertisement \n \n In your mouth and your teeth, constantly stared at you, the measuring vessel of your lord. What is it? Beer. \n \n Would it make that riddle any funnier if I told you an alternate translation for \"your teeth\" is \"your urine\"? Maybe not. Well, how about this bawdy joke about deflowered women? \n \n The deflowered girl did not become pregnant. The undeflowered girl became pregnant. What is it? Auxiliary forces. \n \n Admittedly, that one is a bit conceptual. It's also possible that we've discovered the ancient Babylonian answer to Andy Kaufman. Either way, I want to see \"auxiliary forces\" as everybody's go-to punchline starting...NOW. Next up, a cutting bit of political humor: \n \n Sponsored \n \n He gouged out the eye. It is not the fate of a dead man. He cut the throat: A dead man. Who is it? A governor. \n \n The translation across 35 centuries does the riddle no favors, but to be fair - I can at least see how that has the structure of something we might call a joke, in that it describes the punitive powers of a governor in less than flattering terms. But enough with these warm-up acts - let's get to the headliner, the ancient Babylonian \"yo mama\" joke. Here it is...or what's left of it, anyway: \n \n ...of your mother is by the one who has intercourse with her. What/who is it? [No answer] \n \n Yes, tragically, this no doubt devastating takedown of somebody's mother's sexual proclivities has been lost to history. Though I do appreciate Wasserman and Streck leaving it ambiguous whether the word is \"who\" or \"what\" the mother is having sex with - even in ancient Babylon, you just can't rule anything out when talking about one's mother. Or perhaps the original answer wasn't lost at all, and maybe the whole point is that nothing human or otherwise would ever deign to have ancient Babylonian sex with this poor unfortunate's mother. We may never know, but I feel confident saying this is the single most important question facing modern archaeology. \n \n Incidentally, the oldest known joke is - and it makes me very proud of humanity to be able to say this - a fart joke. Here's a 3,900 year old zinger from Sumer: \n \n \"Something which has never occurred since time immemorial - a young woman did not fart in her husband's lap.\" \n \n Well, it's certainly about farts, although I suppose the \"joke\" bit is debatable. Then again, I shudder to think what people are going to make of what we considered comedy in the year 5,500. Except Parks and Recreation, of course - the brilliance of Ron Swanson transcends all known boundaries of space and time. \n \n Iraq via Discoblog. ||||| 3500 years ago, a student in Babylon did the inevitable and carved jokes about \"beer,\" \"intercourse,\" and \"your mother\" into a tablet. Now researchers have done the inevitable and published an elevated dissection of said jokes in a reputable journal. In recognition of the great future minds who will a millenia from now ponder \"Two And A Half Men,\" let's give due attention to this tablet, shall we? It's pretty awesome. \n \n Discovered by the archaeologist J.J. van Dijk in 1976, the tablet has since been lost without a trace, like so many single socks. Fortunately van Dijk left images behind, which researchers Michael Streck and Nathan Wasserman were able to analyze in a recent paper for the journal Iraq. Streck and Wasserman call the 6 riddles within \"wisdom literature,\" or aphorisms, but the structure of them isn't far off from our modern-day jokes. Due to the tablet's less-than-perfect state, the translations are a little patchy. Still, behold, an alcohol reference: \n \n In your mouth and your teeth, constantly stared at you, the measuring vessel of your lord. \n \n (-What is it?) Beer. \n \n True, it's not what you'd call a knee-slapper, but \"your teeth,\" according to Streck and Wasserman, could also be read as \"your urine.\" And everyone knows \"urine\" is \"funny.\" Moving on, a twosome concerning those twin foci of late-night talk show hosts: sex and politics. Number one: \n \n The deflowered (girl) did not become pregnant. \n \n The undeflowered (girl) became pregnant (-What is it?) Auxiliary forces. \n \n This one is \"unclear,\" according to Streck and Wasserman. We call it \"surrealist.' \n \n And: \n \n He gouged out the eye: \n \n It is not the fate of a dead man. \n \n He cut the throat: A dead man (-Who is it?) The governor. \n \n This is apparently a reference to a Bayblonian governor's power to sentence people to death, according to Streck and W. In the comedy world, \"speaking truth to power\" commentary is often more direct than clever (see Louis CK's tweets about Sarah Palin), so...perhaps this is the Babylonian equivalent of a \"Politically Incorrect\" intro? Finally, we come to the jewel in the crown, a joke that foreshadows the greatest MTV show to star Wilmer Valderamma. Say hello to \"Yo' Mama: The Streets Of Babylon.\" \n \n ...of your mother is by the one who has intercourse with her. What/who is it? [No answer] \n \n \"Your mother\"? \"Intercourse\"? If this isn't a precursor to the greatest take-down since McCarthy's \"You know how I know you're a communist?\" series, we'll eat our most ancient hat.

    "input": "Luckiest man on earth? It's A-Rod On 75th anniversary of Lou's speech, Alex is Yank with most to be thankful for \n \n NEW YORK -- On the day the Yankees commemorated the 75th anniversary of the famous Lou Gehrig speech, it is clear Alex Rodriguez is truly the luckiest man on the face of the Earth ... Earth ... Earth. \n \n It is also clear that for a guy with low testosterone, he sure has some set of onions. \n \n [+] Enlarge Jim McIsaac/Getty Images A new book says MLB permitted Alex Rodriguez to use testosterone before his 2007 MVP season. A-Rod's big year led to another huge payday. \n \n In some ways, the A-Rod story is an inspiring one, the tale of a man beset with crippling physical disabilities -- in addition to his testosterone deficiency, he also was born with congenital deformities in both hips, according to his orthopedic surgeon -- and yet was able to rise to a level of success in Major League Baseball achieved by only a handful of (presumably healthy) men who came before him. \n \n And he did it all with the help and blessing of MLB, which in its benevolence took pity on this poor specimen and helped him live his dream. \n \n If anyone should be angered by this heartwarming tale, it is the New York Yankees, because without that help, A-Rod might not have won that 2007 MVP award, nor would he have had the gumption to opt out of his 10-year, $252 million deal at the seven-year mark to seek an extension and a raise. \n \n Then again, maybe he would have. \n \n That is, of course, if the Yankees didn't already know about it. \n \n If nothing else, this latest A-Rod tale -- that he requested, and received, permission from MLB to use testosterone and a female fertility drug called clomiphene citrate (Clomid), both banned performance-enhancers, on the grounds that his body was deficient in both substances -- only reminds us of how this man's hubris truly knows no limits. (Unless, of course, he was trying to get pregnant, too.) \n \n For one thing, if he was deficient in testosterone, it was likely because prior (undetected) steroid use had curtailed his body's ability to produce its own. \n \n For another, when the bill finally came due in 2013 in the form of the Biogenesis investigation that ultimately cost him a one-year suspension -- and $25 million of that raise he had extorted out of the Yankees based on a PED-tainted season -- he had the nerve to appeal the decision, publicly smear his benefactors-turned-accusers, and file lawsuits against everyone in sight. \n \n Of course, there are no good guys in this tale, told in a forthcoming book, \"Blood Sport: Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis and the Quest to End Baseball's Steroid Era\" by authors Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts. \n \n For one thing, the players' association did everything it could to resist tougher steroid testing for as long as possible, and MLB went along with it. \n \n For another, none of the players publicly seemed to have a problem with illegally jacked teammates, as long as they were helping their teams win and helping them collect playoff checks. \n \n In fact, if there are 750 major league baseball players, you can imagine there were 750 requests for what baseball terms TUEs -- therapeutic use exemptions -- for everything from testosterone to Ritalin and Adderall. Because as we have recently learned, a disproportionate number of professional baseball players suffer from attention deficit disorder, too. \n \n The fact that Alex Rodriguez was granted one of those TUEs is not only comically ironic, but deeply embarrassing to baseball. \n \n Already, he had tested positive for steroid use in survey testing conducted in 2003, an offense for which there was no penalty since Congress had yet to pressure MLB and the MLBPA into adopting the current Joint Drug Agreement. \n \n And there had been suspicions about Rodriguez throughout his career; by his own admission, he began using steroids in 2001, after signing what was then the largest contract in sports history, for fear of not being able to live up to the expectations. (Testosterone can be used to treat performance anxiety.) \n \n So while it may be hard to believe that a reputable doctor would diagnose low-T and prescribe testosterone to a man with the body, physical abilities, and history of Alex Rodriguez, that is precisely what happened. \n \n A North Carolina physician, Bryan W. Smith, approved the medical exemption. Smith was the IPA -- independent program administrator -- appointed jointly by MLB and the MLBPA, but supposedly not answerable to either. \n \n Requests for comment from Dr. Smith on Wednesday were rejected, and all calls were referred to MLB's public relations department. \n \n None of MLB's officials would comment on the record, but the league did release a statement distancing itself from the process and never mentioning Alex Rodriguez by name. \n \n A baseball source refused to tell ESPNNewYork.com whether the Yankees were aware of A-Rod's medical exemption when they tore up his old contract and replaced it with a new 10-year, $275 million deal that could add another $30 million in home run bonuses. But clearly, they liked whatever he was doing and weren't really interested in how he was doing it. \n \n In fact, the only way this information even came to light was because it was introduced into evidence at A-Rod's grievance hearing in his 162-game suspension, of which a confidential copy of the testimony \"somehow'' found its way into the hands of the authors. \n \n None of it is going to matter, of course. \n \n Alex Rodriguez winds up losing $25 million in salary for this year, which is money he was only due under the new contract, which was based on tainted numbers. \n \n He is free to come back to the Yankees next year, and in fact has every intention of doing so. \n \n Even if, at 40 -- the age he will turn on July 27 of next season -- he can't put up the kind of numbers he did in the Golden Age of 2007, he is still entitled to some $61 million of Hal Steinbrenner's money. \n \n And with a little bit of luck, he will still hit enough home runs to collect on at least one, and maybe even two, of those $6 million bonus checks. \n \n On the day that we commemorate the tragedy of a man who only thought he was lucky, it is only fitting to take a moment and marvel at one who truly has been. ||||| \"Blood Sport\" is about far more than Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis, and PED's. It's also about a culture in sports that promotes cheating for the sake of self-aggrandisement and the almighty dollar. Thoroughly researched by authors Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts, \"Blood Sport\" offers a blow-by-blow description of the history of the events that eventually led to the suspensions of some 15 Major League ballplayers, most notably the season-long (2014) suspension of Alex Rodriguez. Although a well-documented, detailed, and accurate account of these events, the book reads more like a piece of well-written fiction, in which intrigue, back-alley deals, robberies, and double-crossing all play their role in bringing these suspensions about. In the end, no one emerges as a hero, certainly not the players who were guilty of trying to circumvent baseball's ban on PED's, nor shady characters such as Tony Bosch, whose clinic supplied players with various banned substances, nor, for that matter, the agents of Major League Baseball, whose heavy-handed tactics, payoffs to witnesses, and legally questionable practices display the same win-at-all-costs mentality that has led so many players to take drugs to gain an edge over their competitors. \n \n \n \n Not only does \"Blood Sport\" provide a detailed account of the story that culminated in the suspensions of Rodriguez and others, but it also goes beyond professional baseball. Although of secondary importance to the main story, we read of the use of PED's at the high school and college level as well (particularly at the University of Miami, which is located right across the street from Tony Bosch's clinic), and the use of such substances in other sports is also noted. \n \n \n \n Elfrink and Garcia-Roberts are to be commended for their thorough research and their objective reporting. Although they make moral judgments from time to time, they do not let these get in the way of the story or color the reader's perception. Their background as newspaper reporters has stood them in good stead in making the finished product such a fascinating read. ||||| The following is an excerpt from Blood Sport: Alex Rodriguez, Biogenesis and the Quest to End Baseball's Steroid Era, by Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts. Published by arrangement with Dutton, a member of Penguin Group (USA) LLC. Copyright 2014 by Tim Elfrink and Gus Garcia-Roberts. \n \n This story appears in the July 7-14, 2014 issue of Sports Illustrated. To read a digital version of the magazine, go here. \n \n As had been the case in the years after he joined the Rangers in 2001, Alex Rodriguez\u2019s first four seasons in the Bronx were marked by incredible individual statistics and disappointing team results. The Yankees failed to make the World Series from 2004 to \u201907 -- but Rodriguez did win the second and third MVP awards of his career, in \u201905 and \u201907. The latter year was particularly impressive: He hit 54 home runs, including the 500th of his career, becoming, at 32, the youngest player to reach that milestone. He also drove in 156 runs and scored 143 -- both career highs\u2014and led the majors with a 1.067 OPS. It all added up to an easy choice when voters filled out their American League MVP ballots. Rodriguez received 26 of 28 first-place votes. \n \n What hasn\u2019t been reported until now is that Rodriguez won that MVP with permission from Major League Baseball to use performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). \n \n From his junior year of high school there had been suspicions -- and, in the case of his 2003 MVP season, proof by way of a failed steroid test that came to light six years later -- that Rodriguez used PEDs. In August 2013, Major League Baseball suspended Rodriguez for 211 games for multiple violations of its PED policy, a decision he appealed last fall. A transcript of a confidential arbitration hearing obtained by the authors of this book suggests that Rodriguez put up those monster numbers in 2007 with the help of a powerful anabolic steroid. \n \n Under baseball\u2019s performance-enhancing drug policy, players can apply for a so-called therapeutic use exemption (TUE) to take certain medical substances otherwise banned by MLB. A doctor appointed by both sides\u2014the independent program administrator (IPA) -- reviews all applications. Baseball also has an expert medical panel to advise the IPA. If an exemption is granted, the player cannot be punished for using that substance. The exemption is good for one year. \n \n Before the 2007 season, Rodriguez asked for permission to use testosterone, which has been banned by baseball since 2003. The IPA in '07 was Bryan W. Smith, a High Point, N.C., physician. (Baseball did not yet have the advisory medical panel.) On Feb. 16, 2007, two days before Rodriguez reported to spring training, Smith granted the exemption, allowing Rodriguez to use testosterone all season. \n \n The exemption was revealed in a transcript of Rodriguez\u2019s fall 2013 grievance hearing. During that proceeding, MLB entered into evidence several exemptions applied for by Rodriguez during his Yankees tenure. In his testimony, MLB chief operating officer Rob Manfred called testosterone \u201cthe mother of all anabolics\u201d and said that exemptions for the substance are \u201cvery rare,\u201d partly because \u201csome people who have been involved in this field feel that with a young male, healthy young male, the most likely cause of low testosterone requiring this type of therapy would be prior steroid abuse.\u201d \n \n Statistics requested in 2008 by Massachusetts congressman John Tierney as part of a government probe into baseball\u2019s PED problem reveal how rare testosterone exemptions are. In 2007, of the 1,354 players subjected to testing, 111 were granted a TUE. Only two, apparently including Rodriguez, received an exemption for \u201candrogen deficiency medications,\u201d the category that would include testosterone. The other exemptions that year involved treatments for baldness, hypertension and -- predominantly -- attention deficit disorder. The alarmingly high number of exemptions for the latter was Tierney\u2019s main concern. \u201cI think it begs a question: Are people using this as a loophole?\u201d said Tierney. \u201cAre they taking these because they are perceived as a performance-enhancing drug, or do they have a legitimate medicinal purpose?\u201d \n \n ***** \n \n During the 2007 World Series, as the Red Sox were sweeping the Rockies for their second championship in four seasons, Rodriguez hijacked the headlines by opting out of his contract with the Yankees. Six weeks later, the team signed him to a 10-year deal that guaranteed him $275 million to stay in pinstripes until '17. In addition, the Yankees added $6 million-a-pop clauses for each all-time home run leader he passed, starting with Willie Mays at 660 and ending with Barry Bonds at 762. \n \n Even after securing his latest windfall, Rodriguez wasn\u2019t done seeking exemptions that allowed him to boost his testosterone levels with banned substances. In January 2008, according to the arbitration hearing transcripts, he requested two exemptions. Rodriguez wanted to use clomiphene citrate (Clomid), a drug designed to increase fertility in women. It is also prescribed to men who suffer from hypogonadism -- a testosterone deficiency -- to block the production of estrogen in their bodies. The drug is popular with bodybuilders at the end of steroid cycles because it can also stimulate the body to make more testosterone. \n \n Rodriguez also requested permission to use human chorionic gonadotropin, a hormone known as HCG, popularly -- and misguidedly -- used for weight loss and also to produce testosterone. Both HCG and clomiphene citrate were banned with the 2008 season. Smith approved Rodriguez\u2019s use of clomiphene citrate that year. The exemption for HCG was denied, but according to the transcript of Manfred\u2019s arbitration testimony, that denial was \u201cmore of a recordkeeping thing than anything else.\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s physician communicated with Smith, and \u201cin their back-and-forth the physician informed Dr. Smith that the player was no longer using [HCG],\u201d Manfred testified. \n \n With permission to use clomiphene citrate, Rodriguez was once again one of the few players allowed to take medicine designed to increase testosterone levels. In 2008, three major leaguers were granted exemptions to take drugs to treat hypogonadism. In fact, from the 2006 season through 2013, only 15 were granted for androgen deficiencies and hypogonadism, the conditions that under MLB\u2019s drug policy could require a medical testosterone boost. \n \n By 2008, Rodriguez had played at least a significant portion of his career -- including, at a minimum, two of this three MVP seasons -- with the apparent help of anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs. He was by far the richest man in MLB, which was finally coming to terms with its steroid problem. Rodriguez had a guaranteed contract until the age of 42. The only wise thing to do would be to ride out that contract while continuing to apply for dubious exemptions but staying on the right side of baseball law. \n \n But Rodriguez wasn\u2019t the type for laurel-resting. \n \n ***** \n \n The handshake that was both Tony Bosch\u2019s biggest break and the beginning of his downfall came late on a sweltering night in Tampa. It was July 30, 2010, and Bosch was flanked by a friend, Jorge (Oggi) Velazquez. To the ballplayer they both called Cacique, or boss, they could have seemed a comical couple as they walked into his hotel room: Velazquez, a short, hard-eyed former liquor-store owner from South Florida with an intense temper, Bosch a twitchy, ingratiating character everybody called Dr. T. \n \n This guy is the best at what he does, Velazquez promised Rodriguez, laying the salesmanship on thick. He can provide you with everything you need. \n \n If the ballplayer had any misgivings, he didn\u2019t show it. Instead, Bosch later said, the first words out of Rodriguez\u2019s mouth were, \u201cWhat were you giving Manny Ramirez?\u201d \n \n The inquiry was rooted in both envy and concern. In 2008, Ramirez, who was traded from the Red Sox to the Dodgers during the season, had at age 36 seemed to rejuvenate his health and his swing, playing in all but nine regular-season games and almost doubling his home run output from the previous season, from 20 to 37. \n \n Of course, in 2009 Ramirez had been nabbed by baseball\u2019s PED police -- he had been caught taking HCG and served a 50-game suspension. Bosch\u2019s name had surfaced in the investigation: His father, Dr. Pedro Bosch, had written the HCG prescription for Ramirez, who did not have a therapeutic-use exemption from MLB. \n \n Bosch explained to Rodriguez that Ramirez had been busted because he hadn\u2019t followed instructions. Getting caught, Bosch explained, was just Manny being Manny. It was \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for Bosch\u2019s clients to test positive if they followed his protocol, he said. He would provide diagnostic blood testing, proper dosing and exact times at which the drugs should be administered. \n \n Rodriguez was sold. Bosch detailed the testosterone creams, growth hormone and other substances he would be recommending, and they made plans to meet again. Soon afterward, the nickname Cacique started appearing in Bosch\u2019s notebooks. Other times, Bosch wrote AER next to his new client\u2019s phone number. The initials stood, of course, for Alexander Emmanuel Rodriguez. \n \n The 2010 meeting between Bosch and Rodriguez was one part luck, one part cosmic inevitability and all parts Yuri Sucart, a cousin of Rodriguez\u2019s who was the slugger\u2019s frequent companion and unofficial personal assistant. In 2009 or early '10, Sucart, who was friends with Velazquez, had a weight-loss consultation with Bosch. Sucart, who had carried around extra pounds since childhood, was nearing obesity in his late 40s. Bosch put Sucart on a pounds-shedding regimen of supplements and hormones. \n \n Sucart doted on, and was employed by, his younger cousin. Sure, Rodriguez had burned Sucart by outing him as his steroid source to investigators and reporters when the slugger admitted in '09 to using PEDs from 2001-03 while with the Rangers. That cost Sucart access to MLB facilities, but it had also given him a salary bump. Sucart, who made under $60,000 from Rodriguez in 2006, saw his pay rise to $100,000 over the next five years. Rodriguez even had the Yankees make an extra 2009 championship ring, worth thousands of dollars, for his banned-from-MLB cousin. \n \n During his treatments with Bosch, Sucart wore Yankees hats and shirts and that championship ring. He also told Bosch that he worked for Rodriguez. Among the supplements Bosch gave Sucart were his signature \u201cgummies,\u201d fast-acting testosterone troches. Sucart told Bosch that he thought the troches packed an \u201cunbelievable sense of energy recovery.\u201d He added that he had given one to Rodriguez and that his cousin \u201cloved it because of its explosive effect,\u201d according to the arbitration decision. \n \n The long-distance flirtation between Bosch and Rodriguez lasted for months, until the superstar finally decided to take the plunge in late July 2010. After losing much of the '09 season to a hip injury, Rodriguez had stayed mostly healthy through the first four months of the '10 season. His numbers were unremarkable but steady: He had 14 home runs by the All-Star break, and against the Royals at Yankee Stadium on July 22, he swatted his 599th homer. Five days shy of his 35th birthday, he was about to become the youngest player to join the 600 club. \n \n When he next came to the plate, the umpire threw the pitcher a specially marked ball to deal to Rodriguez. Umps would continue to do this until he hit his next home run; the mark would be used to authenticate the milestone ball. But Rodriguez didn\u2019t homer in that game. In fact, he didn\u2019t clear the fence through the three games remaining in the home stand. \n \n The Yankees left for a seven-game road trip on July 26, and Rodriguez failed to connect during four games in Cleveland. For any other hitter, a two-week home run drought would barely register. But what began as a celebratory chase was turning torturous. As sellout crowds followed his every game, Rodriguez complained that stadiums of flashing cameras on each swing never let him forget the looming milestone. \n \n Even without the power drought, Rodriguez might have hooked up with Bosch eventually. Despite his enormous talent, Rodriguez spent his career seeking a synthetic edge, especially when struggling to meet mile-high expectations. Taken as a whole, Rodriguez\u2019s greatest baseball achievements were inseparable from his use of PEDs. Now his body was corroding due to age. But all he needed was one more push to knock down those historic milestones and place himself among the all-time greats. \n \n The call came to Velazquez in late July, and he relayed the inquiry to Bosch: Rodriguez wanted to talk about becoming a client. They met at a Tampa hotel following a road loss to the Rays; Rodriguez, still stuck on 599, had gone 0-for-4. Sucart, who despite MLB\u2019s ban had remained Rodriguez\u2019s shadow, joined his cousin, Velazquez, and Bosch in the hotel room. \n \n The foursome met often. In early August, they gathered again, this time at Rodriguez\u2019s $30,000-per-month apartment on Central Park West, a building that Denzel Washington and Sting also called home. Bosch insisted on drawing blood to design an appropriate protocol for Rodriguez. He then flew back to Miami with Rodriguez\u2019s plasma, knowing the vial contained the opportunity of his career. \n \n Bosch consulted with a urologist, according to the arbitration decision. He also had lengthy conversations about Rodriguez\u2019s medical history with Sucart. Bosch dreamed up an elaborate doping protocol that would take Rodriguez into December, built around testosterone, HGH, and growth-hormone-producing peptides. Less than a week later, Bosch traveled to see Rodriguez in New York; his luggage was packed with preloaded syringes. \n \n On Aug. 4, Rodriguez finally connected on a pitch and made a sold-out Yankee Stadium erupt. Home run No. 600 flew into Monument Park, the museum beyond centerfield honoring Yankees greats. As he rounded the bases, Rodriguez lifted his palms coyly. His teammates streamed out of the dugout to congratulate him, and he took a curtain call for the roaring crowd. \n \n At that point, fans knew only about Rodriguez\u2019s positive steroid test back in 2003. That was still enough to mark Rodriguez forever as a cheater. But this moment was a step toward redemption and leadership in the eyes of the fans and his team. The previous October, he had finally earned a championship ring. Now No. 600 was out of the way. \n \n Rodriguez wasn\u2019t on Bosch\u2019s regimen yet. But even as he circled the bases, and after the game as his colleagues were praising him for succeeding without steroids -- \u201cThat\u2019s a chapter of his life I think he\u2019s turned the page on,\u201d said hitting coach Kevin Long -- Rodriguez knew he\u2019d found the man who would help energize the latter stage of his career. He was one week past his 35th birthday, and he was determined to collect every one of those milestone bonuses in his contract. He wanted to be the lone member of the 800 home run club, Bosch would later say. To do that would take a nature-defying power surge in his late 30s of the sort Barry Bonds had pioneered. \n \n On Aug. 14\u2014 -- even days after his down-to-the-minute regimen with Bosch began -- Rodriguez slammed three home runs in Kansas City. Afterward, he admitted for the first time that his lagging power production had bothered him. \u201cI haven\u2019t really hit for any power this year, so it\u2019s been frustrating,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing stuck at 599 was really a microcosm of what\u2019s happened all year. I\u2019ve been able to drive in runs and hit some doubles here and there, but overall I\u2019ve hit for no power.\u201d \n \n But now, Tony Bosch had a believer. \n \n To purchase a copy of Blood Sport, go here.",

An excerpt from the upcoming book, Blood Sport, published in Sports Illustrated yesterday reveals that Rodriguez applied for a \"therapeutic use exemption\" to baseball's drug policy, which allows players to take banned substances if they have a medical reason. Rodriguez got an exemption to use testosterone, the league revealed in Rodriguez's 2013 grievance hearing. In the hearing, MLB's COO called testosterone \"the mother of all anabolics,\" and noted that the most common reason a healthy young man would be low on it would be \"prior steroid abuse.\" Only one other player that year got an exemption for a drug that would boost testosterone. The next year, A-Rod got another exemption, this time for a female fertility drug that bodybuilders often use to boost testosterone. \"For a guy with low testosterone, he sure has some set of onions,\" quips Wallace Matthews in a scathing piece at ESPN; he calls the story \"not only comically ironic, but deeply embarrassing to baseball.\" For the full excerpt, which also explains how A-Rod fell in with Biogenesis, click here."

    "input": "President Barack Obama's nominee to be general counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency indicated at her confirmation hearing Tuesday that she opposes giving members of Congress access to Justice Department legal memoranda that govern CIA activities such as interrogation and drone strikes. \n \n The nominee who rebuffed Senate Intelligence Committee Chairwoman Dianne Feinstein, Caroline Krass, has served as a top lawyer in the Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel and at times as the acting director of that office. \n \n Feinstein opened her questioning of Krass by asking her if she would commit to sharing OLC opinions with the Senate panel. \n \n \"This isn't just idle curiousity. It is really to understand the direction and rules under which certain programs operate,\" Feinstein said. \"We have found that these opinions are actually indispensable to effective oversight.\" She said that an inspector general report found the CIA waterboarded 9/11 suspect Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in a manner inconsistent with the OLC opinion on waterboarding. \n \n Krass responded initially by saying she was committed to making sure senators on the panel understood the legal framework CIA is working in, but she stopped short of committing to share the written opinions. \n \n \"I do believe the committee needs to fully udnerstand the legal basis for any activities, intelligence acitvities, in which the CIA is engaged, including covert action,\" Krass said. \n \n Feinstein was unsatisfied and pressed Krass for a \"yes or no\" answer on access to the opinions. What the senator got sounded pretty much like a \"no.\" \n \n \"The OLC opinions represent predecisional, confidential legal advice that\u2019s been provided. Protecting confidentiality of that legal advice preserves space for their to be a full and frank discussion among clients, policymakers and their lawyers within the executive branch and really furthers the rule of law and allows for effective functioning of the executive branch,\" Krass said, repeating her offer to help the committee understand the administration's legal thinking and saying she has \"an almost unique ability to do that.\" \n \n \"I think we do understand it,\" Feinstein replied. \"I think it has been explained to us but every OLC opinion has been a fight to obtain and we have obtained very few of them, only those that relate to U.S. citizens.\" \n \n Feinstein didn't immediate explain what she meant, but she may have been referring to a battle the committee had earlier this year to get opinions on targeting terrorism suspects for deadly force in drone attacks. The confirmation of CIA Director John Brennan was held up for a time until President Barack Obama agreed to share legal memos on the subject with Congressional committees. \n \n Joining Feinstein, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said she was \"troubled\" by Krass's answer. Collins noted that the Office of Legal Counsel often releases unclassified opinions. \n \n \"They go through an extensive review process....We try to publish opinions when we can to promote transparency,\" Krass said, before saying there would be some merit to considering that for classified legal opinions. \"I do think it's worth exploring whether there could be some kind of similar process with respect to classified OLC opinions.\" \n \n Pressed by Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Krass said she does not believe Congress has a right to Office of Legal Counsel opinions. \n \n \"I do not think so, as a general matter,\" she said. \n \n Last month, the Justice Department pressed a federal appeals court to preserve the Office of Legal Counsel's ability to keep legal opinions from the public. \n \n Collins also raised a 2011 episode in which Obama rejected a legal interpretation advanced by Krass and the Pentagon's top lawyer at the time, Jeh Johnson, which would have curtailed U.S. operations in Libya. Obama sided with his White House counsel and State Department lawyers in deciding to continue the operation. \n \n In an indirect way, Collins suggested Krass might have quit if she thought what the president proposed doing was illegal. \n \n \"What I don't like seeing is the administration shopping around until it gets a legal opinion with which it agrees and that seems to have happened in the case of Libya,\" Collins said. \n \n UPDATE (Tuesday, 4:05 P.M.): This post has been updated with the exchange with Levin. \n \n Read more about: Transparency, Justice Department, Senate Intelligence Committee, Office Of Legal Counsel, Central Intelligence Agency, Caroline Krass, Legal Opinions ||||| \u201cIf this is true,\u201d Mr. Udall said during a hearing on the nomination of Caroline D.

Instead, she said she was wearing stockings and a dress, and originally told police in 2013 that she had a jacket on, too, but said on Monday that she wasn\u2019t wearing one. \n \n There were other things she couldn\u2019t remember \u2014 notably the size of Rouschop\u2019s penis (measuring two inches erect, court has heard). \u201cYou just see so many of them \u2026 you just close your eyes and do it,\u201d she replied. \n \n I don\u2019t remember the little details, but I know it happened \n \n She also didn\u2019t recall the accused\u2019s umbilical hernia, around the size of a baseball. \n \n Calvinho established that the complainant\u2019s memory was bad when it came to ever-changing details. \n \n But the witness shot back: \u201d I don\u2019t remember the little details, but I know it happened.\u201d \n \n The trial continues Tuesday in courtroom No. 32 at the Elgin Street courthouse with Superior Court Justice Robert Smith presiding. ||||| The lawyer defending an alleged choker-rapist told a jury on Thursday that Jacques Rouschop couldn\u2019t physically have committed the vicious sex crimes he\u2019s accused of because his hernia \u201cmakes it too painful to have sex from behind, his stomach is too large and his penis is way, way too small.\u201d \n \n The first defence witness, a registered nurse, testified that she volunteered to take Rouschop\u2019s measurements. She testified that Rouschop is five feet six inches tall, with a 66-inch waist, 31-inch thighs, and a one-inch penis, measuring approximately two inches when erect. The nurse also measured his umbilical hernia, saying it was 3.5 inches by 3.25 inches.

He has made mistakes. He has committed crimes. He has spent time in jail and has a significant criminal record.

    "input": "Bed bugs are bed bad. People\u2019s entire lives have been overturned by these (increasingly common) blood-sucking, itch-inducing pests. Thankfully, they\u2019re not disease vectors, but I would rather not share my home with a roommate who wants to eat me, thank you very much. \n \n Scientists have noticed an expansion in bed bug cases across the world, in no small part due to increased international travel. But one team wanted to know how the bed bugs managed to hitch a ride, and how to prevent the spread. It turns out that part of the answer lies with the dirty laundry inside your travel bag. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \u201cThere are a lot of good studies out there focused on trying to understand how bed bugs are attracted to humans and how they get around apartment blocks, but no one has really talked about how they get into the house in the first place,\u201d study author William Hentley from the University of Sheffield in the UK told Gizmodo. \u201cStopping people from bringing bed bugs home can be a big step in preventing them spreading throughout the world.\u201d \n \n Scientists already know that human odor attracts bed bugs, though not which chemicals in the odor specifically. But for the newest study, researchers prepared a mock bedroom with laundry bags containing clean and dirty clothes\u2014in other words, there were no humans in the room. The critters were \u201ctwice as likely to aggregate on bags containing soiled clothes compared to bags containing clean clothes,\u201d according to the paper published today in the journal Scientific Reports. Contrary to the researchers\u2019 hypothesis, the amount of carbon dioxide in the room did not affect their results\u2014the CO2 source would represent a human, since some bugs like mosquitos are specifically attracted to the carbon dioxide you exhale. \n \n These results were enough to convince the researchers that bed bugs could travel throughout the world by hitching a ride in luggage containing dirty clothes. \n \n Advertisement \n \n As a caveat, this was an experimental room and not real life, said both Hentley and Toby Fountain, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Uppsala in Sweden who was not involved in the study. But still, said Fountain, the authors \u201cdemonstrate a striking pattern that bags containing clothes with human odor were more frequently used as refuges than those without. This result emphases the importance of making sure luggage and other belongings are made as inaccessible to bed bugs as possible when staying in increased risk places, for example by making sure bags are fully closed and secured and kept away from the bed.\u201d Hentley agreed with this advice. \n \n So there you have it. When traveling to possibly bed bug-contaminated locations\u2014like, say, that sketchy-seeming hotel\u2014keep your luggage on metal racks (bed bugs don\u2019t like crawling on metal, said Hentley) or put your whole suitcase in a plastic bag to avoid picking up the horrors that are bed bugs. \n \n [Scientific Reports] ||||| In the absence of a human host, bed bugs were twice as likely to aggregate on bags containing soiled clothes compared to bags containing clean clothes. Contrary to our predictions, elevated CO 2 did not affect this result. We did not observe bed bugs aggregating on the side of the room with the CO 2 source, but instead found an increased likelihood of bed bugs leaving their refuge. Our data are most consistent with the notion that elevated CO 2 initiates host-seeking behaviour. This is similar to findings in Aedes aegypti and Anopheles gambiae where very small increases in CO 2 concentration stimulate host-seeking behaviour19, 20. The position of the CO 2 source in a closed room above and away from the bed bug release point means directional cues as to the source of CO 2 may have been difficult for bed bugs to discern and so it is not possible to conclude whether or not the lack of aggregation on that side of the room suggests a lack of attraction to CO 2 . Many commercial bed bug monitors use CO 2 in conjunction with thermal and/or chemical cues, and claim higher catch rates than monitors without CO 2 . Our results suggest that any increase in capture rate in such devices10, 21 might be caused by increased activity rather than, or in addition to, increased attractiveness. \n \n The smallest bottle-neck through which a new bed bug population can pass, and therefore the most likely passive (i.e. long-range) dispersal phenotype, is a single mated adult female5. There is some experimental evidence for a female \u2018disperser\u2019: work using small arenas and shorter time scales found that females were more active than males22 and more likely to disperse from aggregations with a 1:1 sex ratio23. By contrast, our study showed there was no significant sex difference in the number of insects found on bags with, or without, human smell (Table 1a). Since dispersal from the refuge may be initiated by hunger, we would expect females (with their higher metabolic rate24) to start host-seeking before males and potentially to do so more often. However, over longer periods, such as that used in this study, males and females are both likely to experience hunger and disperse from the refuge. Our design does not enable us to resolve this issue. \n \n Our results do show that bags containing soiled clothes were significantly more attractive to bed bugs than identical bags containing clean clothes. Human odour is a known cue for host-seeking bed bugs11, but until now studies have focussed on how these cues determine the attractiveness of a sleeping host. Our results show that bed bugs will move to, and aggregate on, soiled clothing in the absence of a host. Bed bugs can sense 104 different volatiles16 found in the odorant profile of human skin25. Many of these volatiles are likely to evaporate from \u2018soiled\u2019 clothes for some time after they have been worn, removed and/or stored. We propose that residual human odour on soiled clothes acts as an elicitor of host-seeking or host-seeking-like behaviours, and that cues such as heat9 or elevated CO 2 may facilitate the activation and sensitivity of such host-seeking behaviour. Consequently, soiled clothing left in an open suitcase, or left on the floor, of an infested room is likely to attract bed bugs. When packed into the suitcase, they will accompany their host back home. \n \n Our results show that over a period of several days bed bugs are attracted to, and remain on, soiled clothing: this provides a biologically realistic mechanism that underpins passive, long-range dispersal in bed bugs. The advent of relatively frequent, short-stay holidays in locations long distances from the hosts\u2019 residence will facilitate the proposed mechanism of dispersal. Careful management of holiday clothing may be an important strategy in the prevention of bringing home bed bugs. ||||| Bed bugs love your stinky laundry. Here\u2019s how to keep them away \n \n On the surface, bed bugs seem ill-equipped for world domination: They can\u2019t fly, jump, or swim; they can survive only on blood; and the world\u2019s foremost apex predators\u2014humans\u2014want them all dead. Yet the parasitic arthropods have recently undergone what scientists are calling a \u201crapid global expansion,\u201d taking over new territories and growing in number and range. And according to a new study, their globetrotting is made possible in part by an unusual form of transportation: our stinky laundry. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a good study,\u201d says Richard Cooper, an entomologist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, who was not involved with the work. He says it makes sense that the bugs are attracted to human odors, even on clothing. \n \n Though they aren\u2019t known to transmit disease, bed bugs (Cimex lectularius) can leave behind itchy bites and cause allergic reactions. In the middle of the 20th century, the pests had been largely eradicated from large parts of the developed world, but bans on effective pesticides in the 1990s, along with cheap air travel, have allowed the bugs to come creeping back. \n \n Unlike ticks or lice, the apple seed\u2013sized bed bugs aren\u2019t travelers: They don\u2019t stay on their hosts for long, and they rarely leave the beds and couches where they feast. So how were they getting onto planes? \n \n \u201cTo me, hitchhiking seemed like the best explanation,\u201d says William Hentley, an entomologist at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom. \u201cThat then led me to this question of whether they\u2019re attracted to our clothes and the smell of humans.\u201d \n \n To figure out whether the bugs were indeed stowing away in our laundry and luggage, Hentley and his colleagues tested whether the insects were attracted to soiled clothing. They set a cage full of bed bugs in the middle of a room and placed two cotton bags at equal distances\u2014one filled with clean clothes and the other filled with dirty socks and T-shirts collected from volunteers. The researchers released the bed bugs from the cage and let them wander freely for 96 hours. \n \n At the end of the experiment, about twice as many bugs were attracted to the dirty clothes as to clean ones, the team reports today in Scientific Reports . That jives with prior experiments that have shown that bed bugs can smell more than 100 compounds produced by human skin\u2014many of which could easily linger on clothes for multiple days, the researchers say. \n \n They also tested whether increases in carbon dioxide\u2014long thought to signal a nearby meal\u2014made the bugs more or less likely to go for the smelly clothes. When added to room, the gas seemed to trigger foraging behavior, but the bugs weren\u2019t any more likely to go for the dirty clothes than they were initially. That suggests that carbon dioxide prompts the bugs to forage, but it doesn\u2019t help them home in on the smelly laundry, the team concludes. \n \n So what can you do to keep the six-legged parasites out of your suitcase when you travel? Hentley is careful to point out that he hasn\u2019t studied these techniques scientifically, but he recommends simply putting your bags up on the metal luggage racks in a hotel room, because the bugs can\u2019t climb up smooth surfaces. If no such rack is to be found, keeping your soiled garments in an airtight bag should help mask the smell. But bear in mind that if you\u2019ve previously put dirty clothes in your luggage, you might need to wrap up your whole suitcase, he says. \n \n Cooper agrees that plastic bags might work, but he doesn\u2019t use them himself. \u201cThe biggest thing is not keeping your luggage on the bed,\u201d he says. Another option: putting your bags into a portable heating chamber whenever you get home and washing and drying your clothes on high heat. \u201cHeat is the Achilles heel of the bed bug,\u201d Cooper says.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Nobody wants to bring home bedbugs after being on the road, and now scientists have some practical advice on how to avoid that fate. A new study in Scientific Reports shows that the little critters are drawn to the scent of dirty laundry, and the lead author translates that into traveling tips. For starters, put your luggage up on metal racks in a hotel room because bedbugs won't be able to climb up the smooth surface, says entomologist William Hentley of the UK's University of Sheffield, per Gizmodo. You might also store your dirty clothes in a separate airtight bag. If the hotel has no metal racks, consider storing your entire suitcase in a plastic bag, which may seem like a pain, but nothing compared to the chore of ridding your home of bedbugs. \"Soiled clothing left in an open suitcase, or left on the floor, of an infested room is more likely to attract bed bugs,\" the authors write. \"When packed into a suitcase, they will accompany their host back home.\" They figured this out by unleashing bedbugs in a room and leaving them be for 96 hours. Roughly twice as many bugs ended up in a cotton bag filled with dirty laundry as opposed to a bag of clean clothes. A Rutgers entomologist who wasn't involved with the study tells Science it's legit and offers some advice of his own. \"The biggest thing is not keeping your luggage on the bed,\" he says. Travelers also should wash and then dry clothes at the highest temperature upon returning home, he adds, because \"heat is the Achilles heel of the bedbug.\" (Another study suggests the bugs prefer certain colors.)"

He's there, too. \n \n We'll see who, if anyone, actually puts clips like this up on television, but at the very least Paul's well-produced video shows how much damning source material is available. ||||| Texas Congressman and fundraising powerhouse Ron Paul\u2018s campaign released an absolutely brutal web ad attacking current national frontrunner Newt Gingrich for \u201cserial hypocrisy.\u201d The spot, which is a too-long-for-TV 148 seconds, features a review of Gingrich flip-flops, accompanied by blistering criticism from the likes of Rush Limbaugh and GOP golden boy Rep. Paul Ryan. With Paul polling in third place in New Hampshire, should Newt be worried about the Ronulan attack? \n \n The ad doesn\u2019t even touch all the bases on Gingrich, but hits hard at Gingrich over his climate change ad with Nancy Pelosi, his criticism of the Ryan budget plan, his Freddie Mac connections, and his support for an individual health insurance mandate, all set to an epic score, and sinister, grainy black-and-white photography. The production is slick, if a bit cliched, but the overall effect is devastating. \n \n Ordinarily, a web ad wouldn\u2019t figure to have much of an impact, but Ron Paul\u2019s supporters are a highly motivated, resourceful lot who will doubtless make sure this spot reaches maximum eyeballs. \n \n Newt Gingrich is the latest in a long line of non-Romneys to take a ride at the top of the polls, and Ron Paul is one of the only candidates left who hasn\u2019t gotten his turn. While Paul is routinely ignored by the media as a candidate with a cultish following who can\u2019t improve on his middling poll numbers, much crazier things have happened in this year\u2019s Republican race. Game on. \n \n Here\u2019s the ad, from the Ron Paul campaign: \n \n \n \n ||||| Topics: 2012 Elections, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul \n \n I was awestruck by a new Ron Paul ad attacking Newt Gingrich even before I saw that I have a cameo at the end. Full disclosure: I think the ad would be better without me. It\u2019s most devastating when it features conservatives attacking Newt. \n \n And it features plenty of them. Watch it yourself, below. It\u2019s titled \u201cNewt Gingrich: Serial Hypocrisy,\u201d which seems an arch reference to Gingrich\u2019s history of serial adultery. But the ad ignores the messy divorces and the Tiffany\u2019s credit line to stick to politics, and there\u2019s plenty to work with. \n \n It starts with Gingrich blathering on about \u201cpolicy and values and seriousness,\u201d and it then marches through examples of his flip-flops and hypocrisy on each of those points. The ad he made with former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, back when he admitted climate change was real, is damning, but news anchor voice-overs reporting his changing positions on the bank bailouts are pretty bad too. We get his attack on Paul Ryan\u2019s budget, and Ryan\u2019s angry reaction, as well as the GOP voter who told Gingrich he was \u201can embarrassment to the party.\u201d We see Fox anchors and CNBC\u2019s Larry Kudlow voicing disapproval for his shifting stands on Freddie Mac, before and after it was revealed he took almost $2 million for strategic advice (don\u2019t call it lobbying!). \n \n The ad gathers momentum, and a sense of moral outrage, as it focuses on Gingrich\u2019s taking millions from Freddie Mac as well as the healthcare industry, and supporting policies \u2014 the individual mandate, universal private insurance, end of life care \u2014 that he now opposes, since they\u2019re all anathema to the GOP base. That\u2019s where MSNBC\u2019s Ed Schultz and I come in; Schultz reads from the Washington Post story revealing Gingrich took $37 million from the healthcare industry, and I note his ever-changing positions on healthcare-related issues. \u201cHe\u2019s flipped and flopped based on who\u2019s paying him,\u201d I tell Schultz. The central voice, though, is Rush Limbaugh, mocking Gingrich over and over. When Schultz and Limbaugh and I agree, you know someone\u2019s in trouble. \n \n I\u2019ve been saying this week that it\u2019s time for the former front-runner Mitt Romney to go on the offensive against Gingrich. But Romney had trouble holding his own in an interview with Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier. So he\u2019s got his own problems now, when he\u2019s tripped up by simple questions about his own flip-flops from relatively friendly Fox News. Ron Paul served up Gingrich\u2019s goose instead. Paul showed similar flair with an ad taking down Texas Gov. Rick Perry, touting his ties to Al Gore. Whether on foreign policy or in the ad war, Paul keeps this race interesting. I\u2019ll be talking about all of this with MSNBC\u2019s Ed Schultz \u2014 again \u2014 at 8 ET. I\u2019ll aspire to make someone else\u2019s highlight reel. Here\u2019s the ad: \n \n Continue Reading \n \n Close ||||| 2951825 \n \n Texas Rep. and GOP presidential candidate Ron Paul released a harsh attack ad Wednesday evening against Newt Gingrich, the former House Speaker and a fellow GOP candidate. \n \n The ad, available to journalists through a \u201cprivate\u201d YouTube link, hit Gingrich for numerous allegedly contradictory statements about individual health care mandates, his involvement with Fannie and Freddie Mac, and Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan\u2019s budget plan. \n \n The Web ad uses quotes from media outlets and commentators including ABC News, the Los Angeles Times, MSNBC\u2019s Ed Schultz, Fox Business Network\u2019s Gerri Willis and conservative radio talked Rush Limbaugh \u2014 and numerous statements from Gingrich himself. \n \n The Paul campaign says it is working to prove that Gingrich is not a consistent conservative. \n \n \u201cOur campaign is making a bold move to debunk the myth that the Newt we are seeing on the 2012 campaign trail is the conservative he has been touted to be all along,\u201d said Paul national campaign chairman Jesse Benton. \n \n \u201cThis step we are taking is necessary, as voters are seeking authenticity among conservatives who are able to show a decades-long career of consistently walking the walk of Constitutional principles, limited government, and promoting sound money and economic policy,\u201d Benton continued. \u201cRon Paul is the only Republican presidential candidate with that record.\u201d \n \n The Gingrich campaign defended Newt\u2019s conservative record, but refrained from mentioning Paul \u2014 instead taking a shot at GOP candidate Mitt Romney. \n \n \u201cNo candidate in the race has achieved more conservative reform of government or spent more time and energy championing the cause of the conservative movement than Newt Gingrich, which is why voters across the country are choosing Newt over Mitt Romney,\u201d Gingrich campaign spokesman R.C.

    "input": "JUDY WOODRUFF: Herman Cain, the latest Republican presidential candidate to lead in the polls, spent the day rebutting sexual harassment charges, including, as you will hear shortly, here on the NewsHour. \n \n Asked repeatedly about the claims, he dismissed them as baseless. \n \n The story first reported last night on news website Politico.com alleged that when Cain was head of the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s, at least two female employees reported inappropriate behavior to senior members of the organization. \n \n The Politico story said -- quote -- \"The women complained of sexually suggestive behavior by Cain that made them angry and uncomfortable, the sources said, and they signed agreements with the restaurant group that gave them financial payouts to leave the association.\" \n \n For its part, the National Restaurant Association says it doesn't comment on personnel matters. \n \n Today, Cain denied the reports for the first time in an appearance on FOX News Channel. \n \n HERMAN CAIN, (R) presidential candidate: I have never sexually harassed anyone -- anyone -- and, absolutely, I -- these are false accusations. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: And in an appearance at the National Press Club, he conceded he knew about the investigation. \n \n RELATED INFORMATION Herman Cain: Sexual Harassment Allegations Are 'Baffling' \n \n HERMAN CAIN: While at the Restaurant Association, I was accused of sexual harassment, and it was concluded after a thorough investigation that it had no basis. \n \n As far as a settlement, I am unaware of any sort of settlement. I hope it wasn't for much, because I didn't do anything. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Asked if his rivals were helping to fuel the flames of this story, he said: \n \n HERMAN CAIN: I told you this bull's-eye on my back has gotten bigger. \n \n (LAUGHTER) \n \n HERMAN CAIN: I have no idea. We have no idea the source of this witch-hunt, which is really what it is. We have no idea. We've been busy trying to get my message out. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Today's responses were in contrast to Cain's no-comment of yesterday. \n \n The report comes at a critical time for Cain. He leads the Republican field nationally and is ahead in a key early state, with a new Des Moines Register poll showing him on top in Iowa. \n \n And now to our Herman Cain interview. I talked to him just a short while ago. \n \n It's the fifth in our series of vote 2012 conversations with the Republican presidential contenders. \n \n Herman Cain, thank you for talking with us. \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Thank you, Judy. Delighted to be here. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Well, as we just saw in that piece, you were saying you did not sexually harass anyone. Let me just ask you, though, a couple of questions -- \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Sure. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: -- to help us understand this. Setting that question aside, what was your relationship with these two women who are making these allegations? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Well, both of them reported to someone who reported to me at the National Restaurant Association, and so they were employees of the Restaurant Association. One of them made a formal charge that I turned over to my general counsel to follow up on to get it resolved. He did -- came back after several months and said there's no basis to it. She couldn't find anyone to corroborate her story. So it was a false sexual harassment claim. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: And what about the other woman? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: The other one I never even knew that that was a claim, formally or otherwise. Totally have no idea. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you know what incidents or -- either incident or incidents they're talking about? And were you ever alone with either one of these women? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: The answer is -- not in a social setting, but maybe in an office or something like that, and we'd have a big convention in Chicago. \n \n One incident with the one who made the formal charge, the only one that I could recall after a day of trying to remember specifics, was once I referenced this lady's height and I was standing near her, and I did this saying, you're the same height of my wife, because my wife is five feet tall and she comes up to my chin. This lady's five feet tall and she came up to my chin. So obviously she thought that that was too close for comfort. It showed up in the actual allegation. But at the time when I did that, you know, it was in my office, the door was wide open, and my secretary was sitting right there, as we were standing there and I made the little gesture. Other than that, I can't even recall what some of the other things were. And as I mentioned, they were all found to be baseless. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: And there was some mention of a hotel room at a convention or at a meeting. Did any one of these women, were they ever asked to meet you, or.... \n \n HERMAN CAIN: That I absolutely do not recall. You know, I have no recollection of that. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Was there any behavior on your part that you think might have been inappropriate? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: In my opinion, no. But as you would imagine, it's in the eye of the person who thinks that maybe I crossed the line. \n \n I worked for the Department of the Navy, the Coca-Cola Company, Pillsbury, Burger King, Godfather's Pizza -- years and years and years of working in the business environment, working around men, women, all types of people -- never, never accused of any sort of sexual harassment. I have never sexually harassed anyone. And so this false allegation to now come up is kind of baffling. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: So were -- have there ever been any other charges leveled against you of this nature that you're aware of? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: No. No, no. None ever that I am aware of. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: And in terms of the settlement which was reached by the Restaurant Association, you as the CEO were not aware of that, or you were aware of that? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: I was not. I was aware that an agreement was reached. The word \"settlement\" versus the word \"agreement,\" you know, I'm not sure what they called it. I know that there was some sort of agreement, but because it ended up being minimal, they didn't have to bring it to me. My general counsel and the head of human resources had the authority to resolve this thing. So it wasn't one of those things where it got above a certain authority level and I had to sign it. If I did -- and I don't think I did -- I don't even remember signing it because it was minimal in terms of what the agreement was. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: And we were told five figures. But let's move on because -- \n \n HERMAN CAIN: OK. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: -- there are plenty of issues to talk about. \n \n And first the economy, a lot of attention to your 9-9-9 tax plan. But let me ask you about the budget, about government spending. You have said that in your first year as president you'd like to see the budget balanced. \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Yes. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Rick Perry has said he's got a plan that would do it, what, in eight years. Paul Ryan would do it in 30 years. It would take a huge, a mammoth cut of $1.6 trillion to get that budget in balance the first year. \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Right. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: So my question is, what would you cut out of the biggest programs -- Medicare, Social Security, defense? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Well, we got to make sure we're talking apples and apples here. What I'm referring to is in my first year - in the first full fiscal year of my presidency, because remember, when you are sworn in, you inherit a fiscal year. The first full fiscal year, my objective is to have a fiscal year balanced budget. Here's how. \n \n First, grow this economy robustly. It is projected that, for this year, 2011, that our GDP annualized will probably grow right around 1.6 percent. My 9-9-9 plan, based upon a static analysis and a dynamic analysis, say that this economy will be growing at around 5 percent. So we going to have more revenue coming in because we going to have more people working and more people paying taxes. So you've got to get both of them going at the same time. \n \n Then -- \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: But you still would have to cut. \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Let me get to the cuts. Yes, I was -- I plan to do an across-the-board 10 percent cut of all of the federal agencies. I just feel intuitively that it's there. \n \n And then, ask my Cabinet -- \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Including Social Security and Medicare? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: No, no, no, no, no, no. No, not including Social Security and Medicare. That's a separate problem that we've got to come back and restructure. I have ideas on that. But I'm talking about the basic expenditures that runs these agencies, not the program. That's a separate problem that I want -- I plan to attack. And I'm saying the agency head is going to have to do a deep dive to help find additional monies in order to be able to do that. So that's the approach that we're going to use. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: So across the board. And you think you could come up with enough money without going after the entitlements. \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Exactly. And the reason is growing the economy so the projection of revenues is going to be much higher. It's going to be tough, but I'm saying that that's the objective that we've set out there. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Two international questions. First, the Middle East -- Syria, where President Bashar Assad has been authorizing the murder of -- \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Yes. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: -- dissenters in that country. As president, would you be willing -- would you be prepared to send American forces -- either air power or ground troops, if necessary -- to put a stop to that? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: No. And here's why, Judy. It is sad that this brutal dictator is killing his own people in order to stay in power. They have never been our friends to begin with. \n \n My philosophy on foreign policy starts with an extension of the Reagan philosophy: peace through strength. And I've added peace through strength and clarity. It's clear they're not our friends. \n \n Now, if there is a way for us to help the opposition without putting our men and women in uniform in harm's way, I would be open to that and I would certainly consider that. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: An example of how you could do that? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Providing them -- \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: -- weapons? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Possibly. Possibly weapons, possibly food and supplies or water, if it were possible. But I would not put our men and women in harm's way simply because it is a humanitarian disaster. I don't believe in doing that. We cannot be the policemen for the world. \n \n And so if it's clear who our friends are, clear who our enemies are, I want to first make sure that we stop giving money to our enemies. They've always been one of our enemies. And so as bad as it is from a humanitarian standpoint, we're not going to, you know, jump in there and jump in the middle there. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: China. \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Yes. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Do you view China as a potential military threat to the United States? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: I do view China as a potential military threat to the United States. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: And what could you do as president to head that off? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: My China strategy is quite simply outgrow China. It gets back to economics. China has a $6 trillion economy and they're growing at approximately 10 percent. We have a $14 trillion economy -- much bigger -- but we're growing at an anemic 1.5, 1.6 percent. When we get our economy growing back at the rate of 5 or 6 percent that it has the ability to do, we will outgrow China. \n \n And secondly, we already have superiority in terms of our military capability, and I plan to get away from making cutting our defense a priority and make investing in our military capability a priority, going back to my statement: peace through strength and clarity. So yes they're a military threat. They've indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability and they want to develop more aircraft carriers like we have. So yes, we have to consider them a military threat. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Your campaign. You have shot to the top of the polls nationally. You are running ahead in the key early states -- \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Yeah. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina. You're doing very, very well. But there was a focus group of voters this past week in the state of Ohio. All of them like you; they say what you're saying is very appealing. \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Right. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: But when they were asked directly, could they see you as president, not a single one of them said that they could. How do you persuade them that's not right, that you could be president? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: The way that I persuade them is to continue to do what I'm doing, which is taking my message to the people. \n \n One of the reasons that I can only speculate that they had that impression is because I am the unconventional candidate. I'm running an unconventional campaign, and we're winning. We're moving up in the polls. So some people are still having to get to -- get used to the fact that a businessman who solved problems can, in fact, be president of the United States of America. More and more people are getting used to that idea. A lot of the states where I have spent a lot of time, they're getting used to that idea. So I believe that people will eventually get past that fact, because I've been continuing to promote the fact that I am unconventional. I'm the businessman, not the politician. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Any doubt in your mind you'll win the nomination -- the Republican nomination? \n \n HERMAN CAIN: Today, no. It's not arrogance, Judy; it's called confidence. I had someone ask me one time, are you arrogant enough to be president? No, confidence. Everything that I've done in my career, I had to go into it with a lot of confidence in order to succeed, and more importantly surrounding myself with good people. That's always been one of my mantras: surround myself with good people, lay out some guiding principles, and then solve the problems that need to be solved. \n \n JUDY WOODRUFF: Herman Cain, we thank you very much for talking with us. \n \n HERMAN CAIN: It's a pleasure, Judy. Thank you. ||||| Cain fumbles Uzbekistan\u2019s name: \u2018Ubeki-beki-beki-stan-stan\u2019 \n \n By Kase Wickman \n \n Monday, October 10, 2011 10:34 EDT \n \n Republican presidential hopeful and former Godfather\u2019s Pizza CEO Herman Cain made clear his opinion of certain foreign affairs in an interview with a religious broadcaster. \n \n Cain sat down for an interview with Christian Broadcasting Network, where interviewer David Brody asked him whether he was ready for the mainstream media\u2019s \u201cgotcha questions.\u201d His example of such a question was, \u201cWho is the president of Uzbekistan?\u201d \n \n Cain responded not only by revealing that he can\u2019t name Uzbekistan\u2019s president (Islam Karimov, for the curious), but by bobbling the country\u2019s name, seemingly in jest. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m ready for the \u2018gotcha\u2019 questions and they\u2019re already starting to come,\u201d Cain said. \u201cAnd when they ask me who is the president of Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan I\u2019m going to say, you know, I don\u2019t know. Do you know?\u201d \n \n Uzbekistan is not as irrelevant as Cain appeared to think. President Barack Obama just weeks ago spoke with Karimov about using the country\u2019s territory as a supply route to move inventory to troops in Afghanistan, moving from the current route through Pakistan. \n \n Watch the video of Cain\u2019s interview with CBN below, captured by ThinkProgress and embedded via YouTube. \n \n (h/t: ThinkProgress)",

Cain has never claimed to be a foreign policy guru\u2014he once boasted that he didn\u2019t know who the president of \"Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan\" was, a remark that greatly amused Hillary Clinton. In last night\u2019s interview, he also said he wouldn\u2019t send troops into Syria, saying the situation was \u201csad\u201d but that the US couldn\u2019t get involved. \u201cI want to first make sure that we stop giving money to our enemies,\u201d he said.

She should not be punished in any way for peacefully exercising her right to freedom of expression.\u201d \n \n Laws that prohibit insults or the disrespect of heads of state or other public officials are contrary to international human rights law and standards. Amnesty International has repeatedly called on the Bahraini authorities to repeal articles in its Penal Code that criminalize freedom of expression. \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja is the daughter of prominent activist and prisoner of conscience Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja, who is currently serving a life sentence for his peaceful role in anti-government protests in 2011. \n \n In addition to facing a year in prison, she was fined 3,000 BD (nearly $8,000), a sum she may not to be able to afford. If the fine is not paid her prison term will be extended by around a year and a half. \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja has been arrested and released several times since December 2011 and has previously spent almost a year and a half in prison. \n \n She is also appealing three other convictions against her, including a four-month sentence for two charges of \u201cdestroying public property\u201d for ripping up photos of the King of Bahrain in May 2012 and a one-year sentence for \u201cinsulting a public officer\u201d after she spoke out to defend another prisoner who was insulted and humiliated by a prison guard in June 2013. The verdicts on the appeal of those convictions will be issued on 3 December. \n \n On 17 November, she will appeal a nine-month sentence related to \"entering a restricted area\" and \"insulting a public official\", when she sought to visit her father who was on hunger strike in Jaw prison in August 2014. \n \n Zainab Al-Khawaja is one of several human rights or political activists in Bahrain recently imprisoned for peacefully expressing their opinion. \n \n \u201cThe Bahraini authorities\u2019 persistent persecution of human rights activists and other government critics is a glaring example of their abject failure to deliver on promised reforms. To prove they are serious about upholding human rights, they need to immediately and unconditionally release all prisoners detained in Bahrain solely for peacefully expressing their views,\u201d said James Lynch.",

Reuters ||||| Image copyright Channel 2 Image caption Khadija Khattab wants viewers to judge whether she deserves to be suspended over her appearance \n \n Egypt's state broadcaster has suspended eight of its female TV presenters and told them to go on a diet, sparking uproar among women's rights groups. \n \n The Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU) has given the women one month to slim down before they can appear on air again with an \"appropriate appearance\", the Al-Yawm al-Sabi website reports. The ERTU has a female director, Safaa Hegazy, a former state TV anchor herself. \n \n The announcement prompted an outcry among the affected presenters. Khadija Khattab, a host on Egypt's Channel 2, told the paper that she wants people to watch her most recent TV appearances and judge for themselves if she is really \"fat\", and whether she deserves to be prevented from working. Another presenter said the situation had upset their families and should have been dealt with internally. \n \n The Women's Centre for Guidance and Legal Awareness condemned the move, saying it \"violates the constitution\" and is a form of violence against women. It's called on the ERTU to backtrack. Despite the criticism, ERTU sources told the Veto news website that the decision won't be reversed, but that the women won't have their pay and benefits docked. \n \n Egyptian media commentators are debating whether the suspensions were justified. At the state-owned Al-Ahram daily, journalist Fatma al-Sharawi says she thinks the policy should be applied across local TV stations. But author and academic Waheed Abdul Majid thinks the channel should focus on improving its content rather than the appearance of the presenters. \n \n On social media, some users voiced support for the women, but others called them \"bakabouzas\", a term Egyptians use to describe overweight girls. One female Twitter user described ERTU head Safaa Hegazy as a \"strong woman\" for making the decision. \n \n The presenters have been defended in parliament, though, with male MP and journalist Sayyid Hegazy asking: \"Who is an ideal weight in Egypt?\" He told the Sada al-Balad news site that a presenter \"might be a little overweight, but she is eloquent\". \n \n Image copyright ERTU Image caption Egyptian Radio and Television Union head Safaa Hegazy was once a TV presenter \n \n Next story: Chinese drivers fashion rat-proof car 'skirts' \n \n Use #NewsfromElsewhere to stay up-to-date with our reports via Twitter. ||||| Egypt's state-run television has suspended eight of its female presenters for being overweight - telling them they can return to the air only after they go a diet. \n \n The move sparked outrage among women's groups and members of parliament but state television authorities show no sign of backing down. \n \n The presenters were given given one month to lose weight and told they will not be allowed back onto television until they have an \"appropriate appearance\", according to the Youm7 newspaper. \n \n The decision was made by Safaa Hegazi, the female chief of Egypt's ERTU public broadcaster. \n \n She took over the position in April on a promise to modernise Egyptian state and make it once again competitive with other major broadcasters in the Arab world. \n \n Mrs Hegazi's order to suspend the eight women seems to have been part of this drive to overhaul her organisation's look. ||||| CAIRO \u2014 Most Egyptian journalists have had to watch their tongues and tone down their reporting over the past three years to keep their jobs under a military-dominated government. Now, the state is ordering some women working as television anchors to practice a similar restraint with their weight. \n \n Earlier this week, Safaa Hegazy, the director of state-run Egyptian radio and television, barred eight anchorwomen from appearing on the air for a month, saying they were overweight, the state-owned Al-Ahram news website confirmed. Ms. Hegazy ordered the women to go on a diet during their suspensions, Al-Ahram said. \n \n Khadija Khatab, one of the eight anchorwomen, said that she had not yet been formally notified of Ms. Hegazy\u2019s order, but added that she was recently told that \u201cmeasures will be taken against\u201d those who fail to lose weight by mid-September, according to an interview she gave to a privately owned television station. \n \n Ms. Khatab said she was offended that coverage of her ordeal included words like \u201cfat\u201d and similar terms she called \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cinsulting.\u201d She also said that the pictures of her that had been circulating and mocked on the internet and social media sites were old and that she had lost weight since they were taken. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cI believe I am an ordinary Egyptian woman who looks normal, and I don\u2019t wear too much makeup,\u201d Ms. Khatab said, challenging people to contradict her.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Eight female TV hosts in Egypt have been suspended, and they've been given one month to win their jobs back\u2014if they come back a few pounds lighter. Via the BBC, the Al-Yawm al-Sabi website reports the state-run Egyptian Radio and Television Union issued the slim-down mandate, though the women are being paid and receiving benefits during their monthlong moratorium. Women's rights activists, as well as the presenters themselves, are livid: An Egyptian women's rights NGO is calling the edict a form of violence against women, and host Khadija Khattab is imploring viewers to watch her newscasts to determine a) if she's \"fat,\" and b) whether her weight should affect her job status. \"I believe I am an ordinary Egyptian woman who looks normal,\" she says, per the New York Times. Critics are also calling the move sexist, as only female presenters were suspended, the Independent notes. The ERTU is headed by Safaa Hegazy, a former female news anchor herself who the Telegraph notes was brought in in April to make the broadcaster more competitive, since ratings for state-run channels tanked after the 2011 Egyptian uprising. Some who approve of the suspension are women: Per the Times, a female commentator for the government-run Al-Ahram website says she's \"sickened\" by the suspended hosts' \"disgusting and repulsive\" appearance, while a female colleague asks: \"Is a ban for eight enough?\" The chair of Cairo's Association for the Development and Enhancement of Women, however, tells the Independent that \"judging anybody on the basis of his or her body weight is not the right criterion,\" adding weight shouldn't be an issue \"as long as he or she does not use nasty words on the air and knows well how to deal with guests.\" Her model example: Oprah Winfrey.

    "input": "Buccaneers aboard the flagship of notorious 18th-century pirate Blackbeard apparently enjoyed a rollicking read, according to an unlikely discovery in a cannon chamber. \n \n A handful of paper scraps recovered from the wreck of Queen Anne's Revenge have been identified as fragments of the 1712 book A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform\u2019d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711, by Captain Edward Cooke. \n \n The discovery was announced Thursday during a presentation by conservators from the Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge (QAR) Conservation Lab at the annual meeting of the Society of Historical Archaeology held in New Orleans. \n \n Queen Anne's Revenge went aground outside of what is now Beaufort, North Carolina, in 1718, and Blackbeard was killed while battling British naval forces in the Pamlico Sound a few months later. The wreck of the pirate's flagship was found by private salvagers in 1996 and excavation by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources began a year later. \n \n The fragments were embedded in a wet mass of textile scraps removed from a breech-loading cannon chamber during its cleaning and conservation in 2016, according to QAR Lab conservator Erik Farrell. The wad, blackened with gunpowder residue, may have served as a gasket for the wooden tampion, a plug that protected the cannon muzzle from the elements. \n \n Sixteen paper fragments, none larger than a U.S. quarter, were eventually identified, and seven of the fragments had legible text. As conservators gently pried the fragments of paper apart, they noticed that the text on successive layers was running in the same direction, leading them to suspect that they had the remains of several pages from the same book. \n \n Eventually, they could make out words including \"south\" and fathom,\" which suggested the fragments may have come from some sort of maritime or navigational text. But there was a particular word that led to the book's ultimate identification, says QAR Lab conservator Kimberly Kenyon. \n \n View Images A paper fragment, cleaned and dried after removal from the cannon chamber, reveals text. Photograph courtesy N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources \n \n \"There was one really key word that stood out: 'Hilo.' It was very distinctive and italicized, which might indicate a place name,\" Kenyon tells National Geographic. \n \n \"It really was luck.\" \n \n Armed with the distinctive clue, QAR Lab conservators reached out to Johanna Green, a specialist in the history of printed text at the University of Glasgow. While the researchers ruled out accounts of Hilo, Hawaii, which didn't appear in European literature until after James Cook's expedition of 1778, Green pointed out earlier English-language mentions of the Spanish settlement of Ilo on the Peruvian coast. \n \n The earliest accounts came from English sailors involved in attacking Ilo during Pacific voyages. Stories about the plunder of Spanish holdings were popular in the 17th and 18th centuries, says Kenyon. \"The English audiences were eating this up.\" \n \n When these printed accounts didn't match with the book fragments from Queen Anne's Revenge, the researchers looked to other stories of Pacific voyages that referenced the plunder of Ilo and eventually determined that their bits of paper came from pages 177, 178, and 183-188 of the 1712 first edition of Captain Edward Cooke's A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform\u2019d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711. \n \n Cooke's book describes his experiences on an expedition made by two ships, Duke and Dutchess, led by Captain Woodes Rogers. Rogers also published an account of the voyage, and both books describe the rescue of Alexander Selkirk from an island on which he had been marooned for four years. That rescue became the inspiration for Daniel Defoe\u2019s 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. \n \n Shipwreck From Explorer Vasco da Gama's Fleet Discovered After 18 years of research, excavations and archaeological analysis, National Geographic grantee David Mearns has successfully discovered one of Vasco da Gama's ships lost at sea in 1503 off the coast of present-day Oman. \n \n Historical accounts show that at least some members of a pirate crew were often literate. Officers would have needed to read navigational charts, Kenyon observes. She also points to accounts of buccaneers pilfering books from seized ships, and even a mention of Blackbeard's diary, which was stolen after his death. \n \n The team of QAR Lab conservators is working with specialist paper conservators and scientists from the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources Division of Archives and Records, along with the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, to conserve the very fragile paper fragments, and a display about the find is being planned as part of the department\u2019s Blackbeard 300th anniversary events during 2018. \n \n The remains of A Voyage to the South Sea take their place among other notable artifacts from the wreck of Queen Anne's Revenge, including the ship's bell, an ornamental sword, and even the remains of a delicate pocket watch. With some 100,000 of the 400,000 artifacts raised from the wreck so far still awaiting conservation, Kenyon is confident that more remarkable discoveries from Blackbeard's ship are yet to come from the QAR Lab. ||||| Old-timey pirates are typically portrayed as stupid, unrefined thugs whose only interests involved plundering captured ships and forcing enemies to walk the plank. The recent discovery of legible text on paper pulled from the cannon of Blackbeard\u2019s flagship paints a strikingly different picture of these misunderstood sailors. \n \n Work by conservationists from North Carolina\u2019s Department of Natural and Cultural Resources shows that Blackbeard and his crew got a kick out of reading \u201cvoyage narratives\u201d\u2014a popular form of literature in the late 17th and early 18th century that chronicled the true accounts of maritime expeditions. Specifically, Blackbeard kept a copy of Edward Cooke\u2019s A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform\u2019d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711, detailing the British naval officer\u2019s participation in a global expedition aboard the ships Duke and Dutchess. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The conservators made the discovery while working on artifacts pulled from the wreckage of Blackbeard\u2019s flagship, the Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge, which ran aground near Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina in 1718. Blackbeard stole the ship from the French in 1717, when it was being used as a slave ship (the French had stolen the merchant ship from its original British owners in 1711, when it was called the Concord). The dreaded pirate gave the vessel a new name, added 40 guns, and made it his flagship. The wreck was re-discovered in 1996, and most of the ship\u2019s 27 known cannons have been raised. \n \n The researchers found 16 tiny fragments of paper in a mass of wet sludge crammed inside the chamber of a breech-loading cannon (how it got there is anyone\u2019s guess). The largest piece was only the size of a quarter, but it\u2019s exceptionally rare to find paper in a submerged wreck\u2014particularly one that\u2019s 300 years old. Paper tends to deteriorate rapidly under water. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Working with specialist paper conservators and scientists from the department\u2019s Division of Archives and Records, along with the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, the Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge Conservation Lab researchers worked to preserve and study the fragments. As work progressed, it became clear that some of the fragments still contained traces of legible printed text. After months of research, the bits of paper were sourced back to the first edition of Cooke\u2019s book, published in 1712. \n \n As noted, voyage narratives were a popular genre at the time, often inspiring both real and fictional voyages. Cooke\u2019s book describes the rescue of Alexander Selkirk, who had been marooned on an island for four years\u2014an account that inspired Daniel Defoe\u2019s 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. \n \n The discovery provides evidence of the kinds of books carried on ships in the early 18th century\u2014pirate ships included. It also tells us a bit more about Blackbeard and his crew; it\u2019s considered the first archaeological evidence of the presence of a specific book aboard the Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge. Of course, we don\u2019t know if Blackbeard, whose real name was Edward Teach, actually read the book. \n \n Advertisement \n \n That Blackbeard had books like this on his ship shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise. He may have read the book as entertainment, helping to pass away the long hours at sea. But he may have also read Cooke\u2019s accounts to get fresh ideas about new places to plunder. \n \n Blackbeard had a fearsome reputation, no doubt, but there was another side to him as well. Historian David M. Ullian of Amherst College explains: \n \n Blackbeard often fought, or simply showed himself, wearing a big feathered tricorn, and having multiple swords, knives, and pistols at his disposal. It was reported in the General History of the Pirates that he had hemp and lighted matches woven into his enormous black beard during battle. Accounts of people who saw him fighting say that they thought he \u2018looked like the devil\u2019 with his fearsome face and the smoke cloud around his head. This image, which he cultivated, has made him the premier image of the seafaring pirate. \n \n Advertisement \n \n But the image Blackbeard portrayed to his victims was in defiance of the man himself, who was described as shrewd, calculating, and surprisingly merciful. As Ullian writes, \u201cIronically, despite his ferocious reputation, there are no verified accounts of him actually killing anyone. He generally prevailed by fear alone.\u201d \n \n [NC Department of Natural and Cultural Resources] ||||| Were 18th-century pirates literate? What sort of books did they keep on board ship? A fascinating new discovery at the Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge Conservation Lab in Greenville helps answer those questions. \n \n Archaeological conservators with the N.C. Department of Natural and Cultural Resources\u2019 QAR Lab have discovered and conserved a type of artifact that very rarely survives on shipwreck sites \u2013 paper. \n \n During conservation work on artifacts recovered from the wreckage of Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge, flagship of the pirate Blackbeard, 16 tiny fragments of paper were discovered in a mass of wet sludge removed from the chamber for a breech-loading cannon. The largest fragment was only about the size of a quarter. Paper is an extremely rare material to find on shipwrecks, especially one 300 years old, because it usually disintegrates very quickly under water. \n \n QAR Lab conservators are working with specialist paper conservators and scientists from the department\u2019s Division of Archives and Records, along with the Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation, to conserve the very fragile paper fragments. As the work progressed another discovery was made \u2013 that there was still legible printed text on some of the fragments, although only a few words were visible. The challenge then became not just to conserve the paper fragments, but also to identify where they were from. \n \n After many months of research, the fragments were determined to be from a 1712 first edition of a book by Captain Edward Cooke, \u201cA Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, Perform\u2019d in the Years 1708, 1709, 1710 and 1711.\u201d \n \n Cooke\u2019s book was a \u201cvoyage narrative\u201d describing his adventures on an expedition made by two ships, Duke andDutchess, which sailed from Bristol, England in 1708. The expedition leader was Captain Woodes Rogers, who also published an account of the expedition, and who was later sent in 1718 as Royal Governor to rid the Bahamas of pirates. \n \n Voyage narratives were popular literature in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, inspiring new voyages both real and fictional. Both Cooke\u2019s and Rogers\u2019 works describe the rescue of Alexander Selkirk from an island on which he had been marooned for four years. Selkirk\u2019s story became the inspiration for Daniel Defoe\u2019s 1719 novel, \u201cRobinson Crusoe.\u201d Although books like these voyage narratives would have been relatively common on ships of the early 18th century, archaeological evidence for them is exceedingly rare, and this find represents a glimpse into the reading habits of a pirate crew. \n \n This unique find from the wreckage of Queen Anne\u2019s Revenge provides archaeological evidence for books carried on ships in the early 18th century, and adds to our knowledge of the history of Blackbeard\u2019s flagship and those who sailed her. The historical record has several references to books aboard vessels in Blackbeard\u2019s fleet, but provides no specific titles; this find is the first archaeological evidence for their presence on QAR. \n \n The task of conserving, recording and documenting the fragments is continuing, and a display about the find is being planned as part of the department\u2019s Blackbeard 300th anniversary events during 2018.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Pirates of yore plundered, but they also read books, apparently. While cleaning sludge out of a cannon recovered from Blackbeard's flagship, scientists discovered bits of paper and were able to figure out the name of a book kept on board. The 16 fragments, each no bigger than a quarter, were lumped together inside the chamber of one of 27 known cannons aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, which ran aground off North Carolina in 1718 and was discovered by divers in 1996, per a release. A few printed words on seven of the fragments helped with the sleuthing, reports National Geographic. After months studying the pieces\u2014one of which reads \"three or\" and \"Hilo, to\"\u2014researchers at North Carolina's Queen Anne's Revenge Conservation Lab identified the book from which the paper came. Deciding Hilo likely referred to the Spanish settlement of Ilo in Peru, researchers scoured early accounts of voyages mentioning the place until they came across the right one. It was a first edition of Edward Cooke's A Voyage to the South Sea, and Round the World, which describes a British naval officer's seafaring adventures from 1708 to 1711. Published in 1712, the book would act as inspiration for Daniel Defoe's 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe. According to Gizmodo, such \"voyage narratives\" also inspired real-life expeditions and might've given Blackbeard \"fresh ideas about new places to plunder.\" Whatever its purpose, the book was apparently considered dispensable when pages 177, 178, and 183-188 were applied to the cannon, possibly as a seal for its wooden plug. (Blackbeard's flagship also carried some unusual medical artifacts.)"

    "input": "A member of the NYPD crime scene unit enters the Sofitel hotel in New York, Saturday, May 14, 2011. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the leader of the International Monetary Fund and a possible candidate for president... (Associated Press) \n \n Dominique Strauss-Kahn's reputation with women earned him the nickname \"the great seducer,\" and not even an affair with a subordinate could knock the International Monetary Fund leader off a political path pointed in the direction of the French presidency. All that changed with charges that he sexually assaulted a maid in his hotel room, a case that generated shock and revulsion, especially in his home country. \n \n Police said the maid picked Strauss-Kahn out of a lineup. Unless the charges are quickly dropped, they could destroy his chances in a presidential race that is just starting to heat up. \n \n The IMF, which plays a key role in efforts to control the European debt crisis, named an acting leader and said it remains \"fully functioning and operational\" despite Saturday's arrest of its managing director. \n \n Strauss-Kahn's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, told The Associated Press that his client will plead not guilty. He and another lawyer went in and out of the Harlem police precinct where Strauss-Kahn was being held early Sunday afternoon, and declined to answer reporters' questions until the arraignment, which was expected later Sunday. \n \n \"He denies all the charges against him,\" Brafman said. \"And that's all I can really say right now.\" \n \n Brafman is one of the city's most high-profile defense attorneys. His clients have included mobsters and such celebrities as Sean \"P. Diddy\" Combs and ex-New York Giants star Plaxico Burress. \n \n Strauss-Kahn, 62, was arrested less than four hours after the alleged assault, plucked from first class on a Paris-bound Air France flight that was just about to leave the gate at John F. Kennedy International Airport. \n \n The white-haired, well-dressed, thrice-married father of four was alone when he checked into the luxury Sofitel hotel, not far from Manhattan's Times Square, on Friday afternoon, police said. It wasn't clear why he was in New York. The IMF is based in Washington, and he had been due in Germany on Sunday to meet with Chancellor Angela Merkel. \n \n The 32-year-old maid told authorities that when she entered his spacious, $3,000-a-night suite early Saturday afternoon, she thought it was unoccupied. Instead, Strauss-Kahn emerged from the bathroom naked, chased her down a hallway and pulled her into a bedroom, where he sexually assaulted her, New York Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne said. \n \n The woman told police she fought him off, but then he dragged her into the bathroom, where he forced her to perform oral sex on him and tried to remove her underwear. The woman was able to break free again, escaped the room and told hotel staff what had happened, authorities said. \n \n Strauss-Kahn was gone by the time detectives arrived moments later. He left his cellphone behind. \"It looked like he got out of there in a hurry,\" Browne said. \n \n The NYPD discovered he was at JFK and contacted officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport. Port Authority police officers arrested him. \n \n The maid was taken by police to a hospital and was treated for minor injuries. Stacy Royal, a spokeswoman for Sofitel, said the hotel's staff was cooperating in the investigation and that the maid \"has been a satisfactory employee of the hotel for the past three years.\" \n \n Strauss-Kahn was arrested on charges of a criminal sex act, attempted rape and unlawful imprisonment. Authorities were looking for any forensic evidence and DNA. \n \n His wife, Anne Sinclair, defended him in a statement to French news agency AFP. \n \n \"I do not believe for one second the accusations brought against my husband. I have no doubt his innocence will be established,\" said Sinclair, a New York-born journalist who hosted a popular weekly TV news broadcast in France in the 1980s. \n \n A member of France's Socialist party, Strauss-Kahn was widely considered the strongest potential challenger next year to President Nicolas Sarkozy, whose political fortunes have been flagging. \n \n \"At the top of the polls,\" Strauss-Kahn tweeted proudly in French last December, linking an article that showed him ahead in opinion polls when French voters were asked whom they would choose in a primary. At a soccer game in a Washington suburb last September, he, his wife and others were seen wearing T-shirts that read, \"Yes we Kahn,\" a play on Barack Obama's 2008 campaign slogan, \"Yes we can.\" \n \n Strauss-Kahn also noted that he trailed only Warren Buffett and Bill Gates on a list of 100 \"global thinkers\" compiled last November by Foreign Policy magazine. Strauss-Kahn was cited for his \"steely vision at a moment of crisis\" _ for convincing Germany to help bail out Greece's debt-laden government, and for helping to put the brakes on defaults in Hungary, Pakistan and Ukraine. \n \n The arrest could throw the long-divided Socialists back into disarray about who they could present as Sarkozy's opponent. Even some of his adversaries were stunned. \n \n \"It's totally hallucinating. If it is true, this would be a historic moment, but in the negative sense, for French political life,\" said Dominique Paille, a political rival to Strauss-Kahn on the center right, on BFM television. Still, he urged, \"I hope that everyone respects the presumption of innocence. I cannot manage to believe this affair.\" \n \n Candidates need to announce their intentions this summer to run in fall primary elections. \n \n \"If he's cleared, he could return _ but if he is let off only after four or five months, he won't be able to run\" because the campaign will be too far along, said Jerome Fourquet of the IFOP polling agency. \n \n \"I think his political career is over,\" Philippe Martinat, who wrote a book called \"DSK-Sarkozy: The Duel,\" told The Associated Press. \"Behind him he has other affairs ... I don't see very well how he can pick himself back up.\" \n \n Strauss-Kahn is known as DSK in France, but media there also have dubbed him \"the great seducer.\" His reputation as a charmer of women has not hurt his career in France, where politicians' private lives traditionally come under less scrutiny than in the United States. \n \n In 2008, Strauss-Kahn was briefly investigated over whether he had an improper relationship with a subordinate female employee. The IMF board found that the relationship was consensual, but called his actions \"regrettable\" and said they \"reflected a serious error of judgment.\" \n \n Strauss-Kahn issued an apology, writing in an email to IMF staff that he showed poor judgment but didn't abuse his position. \n \n The sexual assault allegations come amid French media reports about Strauss-Kahn's lifestyle, including luxury cars and suits, that some have dubbed a smear campaign. Some French raised suspicions about the sexual assault case as well. \n \n \"Perhaps this affair will unravel very quickly, if we learn that there is in the end no serious charge and that what was said by this woman was not true, and we all wish for this,\" former Socialist Party boss Francois Hollande said on Canal-Plus television. \"To commit an act of such seriousness, this does not resemble the man I know.\" \n \n At La Rotonde, a cafe on Paris' Left Bank, psychiatrist Sylvie Etienne said Strauss-Kahn's alleged behavior is very sad because he had had a \"great chance\" of becoming president. Her daughter, high school literature teacher Stephanie Plou, said it was probably for the best. \n \n \"This had to come out one day. Better now than when he's president,\" she said. \n \n A former economics professor, Strauss-Kahn served as French industry minister and finance minister in the 1990s, and is credited with preparing France for the adoption of the euro by taming its deficit. \n \n He took over as head of the IMF in November 2007. The 187-nation lending agency provides help in the form of emergency loans for countries facing severe financial problems. \n \n Sarkozy, who did not comment publicly Sunday, had championed Strauss-Kahn to run the IMF. Political strategists saw it as a way for Sarkozy to get a potential challenger far from the French limelight. \n \n Caroline Atkinson, an IMF spokeswoman, issued a statement Sunday that said the agency would have no comment on the New York case. She referred all inquiries to Strauss-Kahn's personal lawyer and said the \"IMF remains fully functioning and operational.\" \n \n Another IMF spokesman, William Murray, said the fund's executive board would be briefed on developments related to Strauss-Kahn on Sunday, and John Lipsky, the IMF's first deputy managing director, would lead the organization in an acting capacity in Strauss-Kahn's absence. \n \n Strauss-Kahn was supposed to be meeting in Berlin on Sunday with Merkel about increasing aid to Greece, and then join EU finance ministers in Brussels on Monday and Tuesday. The IMF is responsible for one-third of Greece's existing loan package, and his expected presence at these meetings underlined the gravity of the Greek crisis. \n \n ___ \n \n Charlton reported from Paris.

Police say that after the three suspects broke in through a glass door at the back of the home Monday afternoon, there was a \"short exchange of words\" with the homeowner's 23-year-old son before he opened fire with an AR-15 assault rifle, KTUL reports. Two suspects died in the home's kitchen. A third fled before collapsing and dying in the home's driveway. Police say that hours after the shooting, Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez, 21, turned herself in. She was arrested and is expected to face three charges of first-degree murder and three charges of burglary. (In Oklahoma, those suspected in a felony that results in a death can face charges of murder.) Wagoner County Deputy Nick Mahoney says the three teenagers were wearing black clothing, masks, and gloves when they broke into the home, the AP reports. Two of the suspects were 17 years old and the third was 18, reports FOX23. One suspect had brass knuckles and another had a knife, according to police, who say the homeowners called authorities and voluntarily provided statements. Police say there's no indication that the suspects knew the homeowner or his son. They say that, for now, the shooting is being treated as self-defense. \"This may be a case of 'stand-your-ground'; however, it's still too early to say for sure, and we're still looking into all aspects of this,\" Mahoney says, per the Tulsa World."

She was overjoyed when he called a few minutes later. \n \n Mr. Briones said one of his regular customers was on the train. She told him later that \u201cshe felt a bump as the train ran over the man,\u201d he said. \n \n The No. 7 line was shut down between Court Square and 61 Street-Woodside Avenue, Deirdre Parker, a spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Transit Authority, said late Thursday, and would reopen only when the police had concluded their investigation there. \n \n It is the second time this month that a man has been killed after being pushed onto the subway tracks.

We're talking about hundreds of thousands of deaths that don't have to happen,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC. \"It's possible for us to make rapid and substantial progress in reducing these deaths.\" \n \n In the United States, about 800,000 people die of cardiovascular disease each year, according to the study published Tuesday in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. Heart disease is the No. 1 cause of death, and stroke is No. 4; along with hypertensive disease, they account for nearly 30% of all U.S. deaths, the CDC says. \n \n Overall, the avoidable death rate for cardiovascular disease dropped 29% between 2001 and 2010, CDC researchers found. But that improvement was not shared equally by Americans of all ages, racial and ethnic backgrounds and states of residence. \n \n For instance, the rate of avoidable deaths dropped 25% for people ages 65 to 74, yet it remained largely unchanged for people younger than 65, epidemiologist Linda Schieb and her colleagues discovered. \n \n Also, the avoidable death rate among African Americans was 107 per 100,000 people \u2014 nearly twice the rate of 58 per 100,000 for whites and more than triple the rate of 34 per 100,000 for Asians and Pacific Islanders. The rate for Latinos was 45 per 100,000. The study's authors cautioned, however, that avoidable death rates for nonwhites and nonblacks may be underestimated due to inaccurate reporting on death certificates. \n \n Across all races and ethnic groups, men had the highest risk of death, roughly double that of women. \n \n The counties with the highest avoidable death rates were concentrated in the nation's Southern states, in a region that has long been described by health officials as the nation's \"stroke belt.\" In 2010, states with the highest avoidable death rates included Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Louisiana. The study's authors cited high-sodium diets, lack of sidewalks and bike lanes and poor accessibility to quality healthcare as contributing factors. \n \n \"It's unfortunate, but your longevity may be more likely to be influenced by your ZIP Code than by your genetic code,\" Frieden said. \n \n The study's authors speculated that some of the disparities were the result of uneven access to health insurance. The fact that Medicare eligibility begins at the age of 65 may help explain why people in the 65-74 age group were able to reduce premature deaths caused by heart disease and stroke while younger Americans did not. (The study excluded people older than 75 in its analysis of preventable deaths because average life expectancy in the U.S. is 78.7 years.) \n \n Smoking, lack of exercise, poor diet and excessive use of alcohol increased the risk of cardiovascular disease in all individuals, regardless of race, age and location, study authors noted. \n \n \"Many heart disease and stroke deaths could be avoided through improvements in lifestyle behaviors,\" they wrote. \n \n monte.morin@latimes.com ||||| Nearly 1 in 3 deaths in the US each year is caused by heart disease and stroke.

We\u2019ve made that perfectly clear. We want to continue to pay our way.\u201d \n \n Irish, Greek and Portuguese bonds fell today amid mounting speculation Greece will have to restructure its debt. All three countries have sought bailouts from the European Union and International Monetary Fund, and Kenny\u2019s government wants a reduction on the rate on its loans, which he has described as \u201ctoo severe.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re not looking for more money from Europe, we\u2019re looking for greater flexibility,\u201d Kenny said, referring to the rate on the bailout and to medium-term financing for lenders from the European Central Bank. He also said that an increase in Ireland\u2019s 12.5 percent corporation-tax rate to appease fellow EU leaders is \u201cnot up for negotiation.\u201d \n \n Ireland\u2019s government last month pledged to inject additional capital of as much as 24 billion euros ($34 billion) into lenders after mounting losses forced the country ask for external help in November. Finance Minister Michael Noonan said on April 8 it\u2019s important to reach an agreement on lower bailout rates before the country taps \u201cserious tranches of money.\u201d \n \n Bonds Fall \n \n Kenny said that Anglo Irish Bank Corp., which is being wound down, may not need further capital. Ireland has injected 29.3 billion euros into the nationalized lender over the past two years.

The yield on Greek and Portuguese bonds of the same maturity rose to euro-era records.

Bank of Greece Governor George Provopoulos warned on Monday it would have \"catastrophic consequences.\" \n \n \"To be clear, Greece has money,\" when considering the public wealth that could be privatized, ECB Executive Board member Lorenzo Bini-Smaghi told Reuters Insider before a New York event sponsored by Chatham House, the home of the Royal Institute of International Affairs. \n \n \"You have the alternative of selling assets and accelerating privatization or going in the direction of major financial collapse, which would happen in the case of default or restructuring.\" \n \n But German newspaper Die Welt quoted an unnamed Greek minister as saying it was only a matter of time before the government took such a step. \n \n And government sources in Berlin told Reuters that some form of debt restructuring now looked unavoidable and suggested Greece move fast, rather than wait until its funding situation gets critical next year. \n \n \"Decisive voices within the federal government expect that Greece will not make it through the summer without a restructuring,\" a high-ranking German coalition source said. \n \n CONTAGION RISK \n \n European shares sank to their lowest close in three weeks on Monday and the euro fell more than two cents to trade briefly below $1.42, its lowest level against the U.S. dollar in nearly two weeks as the euro zone debt crisis rattled market confidence. \n \n U.S. stocks also took a hit after Standard & Poor's cut its credit outlook for the United States to negative in a reminder that the euro zone is not alone in suffering from high debt and deficits. \n \n The cost of insuring Greek debt against default jumped and Spanish 10-year bond yields rose toward record highs near 5.6 percent, while Portuguese yields hit a new peak of 9.4 percent. \n \n European officials have been at pains to stress that Spain can avoid the contagion that has forced Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek rescues. Its much larger economy could strain the bloc's resources to breaking point if it did succumb to the need for a debt bailout. \n \n Data on Monday showed an accelerated drop in Spanish housing prices in the first quarter and a surge in yields at a government treasury bill auction. \n \n Spain faces a further test of demand for its debt on Wednesday when it aims to raise 2.5 to 3.5 billion euros with two long-maturity issues. \n \n GREEK DEBT BIGGER THAN ARGENTINA BEFORE DEFAULT \n \n In order to return Greece's economy to a sustainable path, most economists agree that it needs to write off roughly half the value of its outstanding debt, hitting private creditors with significant \"haircuts\" on their holdings. \n \n Greece's debt load of 325 billion euros is nearly double the level most economists see as sustainable and far bigger than that of Argentina when it defaulted in late 2001. \n \n But EU leaders have promised not to make private debt holders pay before 2013. \n \n Doing so in the near-term, when the bloc remains vulnerable, could raise pressure on Portugal and Ireland to restructure their debt also, threatening bank balance sheets in the euro zone. \n \n Winning creditor agreement for a milder form of restructuring, like a voluntary extension of debt maturities, is likely to be difficult. \n \n And even if it does work, it would probably not make enough of a dent in Greece's debt burden to ensure sustainability over the longer-term. Markets may view the \"restructuring lite\" option as merely the first step in a two-stage restructuring, with the real pain yet to come. \n \n PORTUGAL BAILOUT AT RISK \n \n Meanwhile, in neighboring Portugal, representatives of the European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund were meeting government officials on Monday to set the terms for the bloc's third rescue in a year following multi-billion euro deals for Greece and Ireland. \n \n After the election in Finland, however, that bailout could come under threat. \n \n The anti-euro True Finns party which scored big gains in the Sunday vote, vowed to push for changes to the Portuguese rescue. \n \n It may take weeks to find out whether True Finns will become part of a new government in Helsinki and be able to deliver on that threat. The party that won the most votes in Finland is pro-European and seems unlikely to compromise its stance even if it does end up in a coalition with True Finns. \n \n But the result underscored the extent of public anger in northern Europe at the series of aid deals for stricken euro zone countries that mismanaged their economies and finances. \n \n \"It is extremely difficult for politicians in Europe to ignore the strong signal from Finland,\" said Steen Jakobsen, chief economist at Saxo Bank. \"Ultimately this could mean a move away from bailouts with no burden sharing by private investors and banks.\" \n \n Any delay in approving the bailout deal for Portugal beyond May could leave the country scrambling for new sources of funding. It faces an election on June 5 and has warned it will run out of money around the same time. \n \n (Reporting and writing by Noah Barkin; additional reporting by Al Yoon in New York) ||||| Dow Jones Reprints: This copy is for your personal, non-commercial use only.

    "input": "Thomas van Linge\u2019s colorful, detailed maps showing which parties control which parts of Iraq, Libya and Syria are a hit whenever he posts them on Twitter. They have been cited on news stories in the Huffington Post, Lebanon\u2019s Daily Star and Vox, as well as on the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s website. But van Linge isn\u2019t a policy expert and he\u2019s never been to the region: In fact, he\u2019s just a Dutch high school student who tracks the war on social media. \n \n Van Linge, who goes by @arabthomness on Twitter, has amassed nearly 11,000 followers since joining the platform in January 2013, the year he published his first map. Many of his followers work for influential think tanks or suggest policy for the region he maps. \n \n Van Linge\u2019s latest map of conflict-ridden Syria, updated June 5, 2015, illustrates just how complex the situation in the country has become. In northeastern Syrian Kurdistan, a tip of yellow is mainly in control of the Kurdish YPG (People\u2019s Protection Units), while the country\u2019s west is a mix of red\u2014representing the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2014and varied green blotches representing the Free Syrian Army and mixed rebel and jihadi-controlled countryside. The city of Aleppo is a palette of colors representing myriad forces like Jabhat al-Nusra, Islamic Front and government soldiers vying for power, making normal life for civilians a deadly struggle. \n \n The rest of Syria is a vast swath of countryside, colored gray, controlled by the militant group Islamic State (ISIS), and punctuated with black circles denoting ISIS-controlled towns and cities. The map is corroborated by news reports from last month that say ISIS now controls around 50 percent of Syria. \n \n Thomas Van Linge/Newsweek \n \n \u201cI want to inform people mostly and show people the rebel dynamics in the country,\u201d Van Linge told Newsweek, referring to his motivation for creating his maps. \u201cI also want to inform journalists who want to go to the region which regions are definitely no-go zones, which regions are the most dangerous, and also to show strategic developments through time.\u201d \n \n Van Linge\u2019s interest in the region was first sparked by the events of the 2011 Arab Spring, particularly the Egyptian revolution. He started following trends in Libya and Syria and made his first map showing the situation for the YPG and Kurdish forces in Syrian Kurdistan in December 2013. Then someone asked him to make a map of Syria as a whole. \n \n \u201cI hadn\u2019t really considered it at the time, but I was annoyed by other maps that didn\u2019t make the distinction between rebels and ISIS groups of areas, which were still at the time intertwined,\u201d he said. In the past 16 months, he\u2019s also made maps of Eastern Ukraine, Somalia, the Palestinian territories and the northern part of Mali, which saw fighting between Al-Qaeda and Tuareg rebels, although the Syria maps get the most attention. \n \n When he starts a new map, which usually takes several weeks to finish alongside his schoolwork, Van Linge takes a large file of a blank map and uses the most humble of tools to start coloring it in: Microsoft Paint. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not very sophisticated with computers,\u201d he said. \n \n Thomas Van Linge/Newsweek \n \n The sources for Van Linge\u2019s maps include Twitter, Facebook and YouTube, as well as personal contacts in the region, including within the Free Syrian Army in Aleppo and others in the Kurdish region north of Aleppo. He estimates he has around 1,000 sources for all his maps, which he uses to corroborate claims of territorial control. \n \n \u201cWhen I see, for example, a status update of a rebel group on Facebook in which they claim they\u2019ve captured a small village, then I usually wait until either other sources report it or footage from rebels within that village shows up on YouTube before I make the edit on my map,\u201d said Van Linge. \n \n He then uses a map tool on Google Earth to make and edit shapes of controlling territories, like the mint green boomerang shape showing a low amount of rebel-controlled countryside in southwestern Syria, which he replicates in the Paint file. \n \n The finished product is shared on Twitter and is often retweeted several times. Pieter Van Ostaeyen, the Belgian jihadist expert described by the Financial Times as an \u201carmchair terrorist tracker,\u201d has also started republishing the maps on his website. \n \n Despite Van Linge\u2019s age and relative inexperience in the world of foreign affairs, some Middle East experts have applaud his maps. Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said he finds the maps \u201camong the most useful,\u201d mainly due to the color blocking system employed by Van Linge. Most mapmakers, Landis says, use \u201cspindly strands of highway control\u201d to show the areas run by ISIS, which might underestimate the group\u2019s power. \n \n \u201cControlling large swaths of desert, where few people live, is strategically important. No one would make a map of Algeria or Saudi Arabia like this, only ISIS,\u201d said Landis. \u201cBy updating his maps frequently and sticking to tradition by trying to depict how much actual territory ISIS controls, Thomas van Linge does us all a favor.\u201d \n \n Rana Khalaf, a researcher at the Centre for Syrian Studies at St. Andrews University, also found the maps useful, but said it would be helpful to highlight the uninhabited desert regions, as well as to use intersecting lines to show contested areas where control can change overnight. \n \n Van Ostaeyen, who publishes Van Linge\u2019s maps but primarily uses Twitter to track and communicate with jihadists, also spoke of how helpful the maps are. \n \n \u201cI found it really interesting to see the evolution of everything going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThomas\u2019s maps are one of the best published on what\u2019s going on in Syria and Iraq.\u201d \n \n At the start of their correspondence, Van Ostaeyen didn\u2019t know Van Linge\u2019s age and was impressed when he found out he was a teenager. He wasn\u2019t, however, surprised. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many weird things, like the Shami Witness case [Van Ostaeyen was in close contact with Mehdi Masroor Biswas, the man behind the pro-ISIS account, who was arrested in Bangalore, India, last December], that I can\u2019t be surprised anymore by something,\u201d said Van Ostaeyen. \n \n Van Linge\u2019s Twitter feed is more than just maps: it\u2019s also a valuable resource for news of ongoing humanitarian crises in the region and around the world. He posts photos of the aftermath of shelling and retweets activists who post graphic photos of children killed by weapons in Syria. He says he does this to raise awareness now that the international media is largely ignoring daily bomb attacks. \n \n \u201cBy tweeting every bombardment, every victim of the Assad regime or ISIS, I believe you\u2019re reminded of these crimes, these events,\u201d said Van Linge. \u201cThey\u2019re ongoing everyday even though they don\u2019t make headline news anymore.\u201d ||||| Islamic State fighters have conquered Rahabi in Iraq. They control the Libyan coast near Sirt. In Syria, they just lost Tall Abyad to the Kurds, but are spreading out in the center of Palmyra. Thomas van Linge is keeping an eye on their movements. The 19-year-old wears a hoodie and, although he only just graduated from high school, he already knows better than most people where the Jihadists are heading, which areas they are occupying and where they've been beaten back. That's because van Linge makes some of the world's best maps of chaotic war zones from the desk of his childhood bedroom in Amsterdam. He has never been to Syria, Iraq or Libya, and he learned Arabic on YouTube. \n \n The young Dutchman isn't just keeping an eye on Islamic State and its \"caliphate,\" he also knows what the rebels of the Free Syrian Army, al-Nusra Front and Lebanon's Hezbollah are doing. In Libya he's monitoring the Zintan Brigades, in Nigeria he's watching Boko Haram, in Eastern Ukraine he's keeping an eye on the separatists. \"All places where people are rising up,\" he says. \n \n His maps have been used by CNN, the New York Times and even SPIEGEL. The question is: Why is a 19-year-old interested in the situation at Syrian front lines? And how does he manage to depict these conflicts so precisely, with more details than almost any other professional cartographer? \n \n Thomas van Linge still lives at home, in a small house near Schiphol Airport, where Star Wars DVDs line the shelves. When he looks out the window, he can see hazelnut bushes and a slide in his front yard. He shrugs with his shoulders -- he has no answer to the question. He's a practical person and believes that everyone should just do what interests them. Afraid of failing at something? No, he says. He claims not to know that feeling. \n \n At school he did theater. He learned the anthroposophical movement art known as eurythmy and completed an internship in a home for senior citizens. He has collected money for species in danger of extinction and memorized the names of all the birds and mammals of central Europe. He attended a school called the Free School, a Waldorf institution where lessons follow the principles of Rudolf Steiner. One of the ideas of these progressive educators is that students shouldn't only be made to learn how to think and feel, but also how to want -- i.e., how to do things. \n \n Moving into the Real World \n \n One evening four years ago, van Linge saw a show on CNN about the Arab Spring in Egypt. He saw furious young people fighting for their freedom on Tahrir Square in Cairo. His mother is a psychologist, his father an economist, and they raised him to be a free thinker who views the world as a place of promise. He says he often wished that others were as free as him. \n \n So he selected the Syrian civil war as the subject for his specialized work at school. He looked up a map of Syria on Google and began inputting front lines and rebel groups. He used different colors. He established contact with activists and gained their trust. They, in turn, sent him information. Then he continued tinkering with the map. In January 2014, he released it for the first time on his Twitter account, @arabthomness. Now he has over 14,000 followers from around the world. He regularly updates the maps. \n \n A flood of information flows together on his mobile phone from Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. He Skypes with fighters on the front, corresponds with activists and charities and even gets messages from other cartographers. In all, he claims to use over 1,100 sources for his Syrian maps. \n \n Now that he is finished with high school, van Linge has been doing a lot of thinking about what he should do next. He says he's like to work freelance, be outside and travel. During his research he learned about a young Syrian whose parents died. She now needs to take care of her little sister alone. Thomas van Linge often thinks about the two. He knows, he says, that his maps don't help the girls. \n \n That has inspired him to think about traveling to one of the places soon he so far has only known from his maps -- possibly into the Kurdish region in northeastern Iraq. He believes he's spent enough time monitoring the situation from afar. He feels that it's now time for him to help people where their suffering is actually taking place. ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented. \n \n This feature is not available right now.

    "input": "The mortgage-foreclosure crisis spilled into the financial markets on Thursday, driving down bank stocks and weighing on mortgage bonds as investors took a grim view of the potential costs. \n \n View Full Image Getty Images A bank owned sign hangs in front of a foreclosed home in Miami, Florida. Bank repossessions rose to their highest level in September, exceeding 100,000 in a month for the first time. \n \n Shares of U.S. banks fell, while the broader stock market was essentially flat. Bank of America Corp., potentially among the most affected, dropped more than 5%. Bank bonds also fell, and the cost of buying protection against a possible debt default by banks climbed. \n \n \"The level of uncertainty in the economy is at extraordinarily high levels to begin with,\" said Jack Scott, chief investment officer at BlackHawk Capital Management, a Charlotte, N.C., money manager that owns mortgage securities. \"The foreclosure problem adds another layer of acute uncertainty.\" \n \n So far, the foreclosure crisis hasn't affected consumer mortgage rates, which remain near record lows. They are closely linked to rates on U.S. Treasurys, which have tumbled in recent months. \n \n The crisis has been escalating for several weeks, as banks suspend foreclosures across the country, citing flaws they have uncovered, including faulty or missing documentation. Tales of mismanagement within the foreclosure process\u2014including so-called robo-signers, who were paid to rubber stamp documents without properly reviewing them\u2014are emerging daily. \n \n Until recently, investors hadn't fled financial stocks. If the issues raised about foreclosure practices in recent days are easily resolved technical glitches, with most foreclosures resuming after brief delays, then the impact on most investors would be small. \n \n \"The [mortgage] market seems to be functioning relatively well, but that could change depending on how we see this play out,\" said BlackRock Inc. portfolio manager John Vibert. \n \n But some fear that it may be difficult to do any foreclosures for a while. The risk is that foreclosure flaws are so widespread, or the political furor so heated, that the entire process grinds to a halt, as Citigroup analyst Joshua Levin said in a conference call this week. \n \n In some cases, that would choke off much of the cash flow used to pay mortgage bondholders. \n \n Another concern is that banks could be forced to modify billions of dollars in loans, including reducing principal, which could leave bondholders as big losers. \n \n \"All this does is increase uncertainty and make me question my estimates of returns\" on mortgage bonds, said Mr. Scott of BlackHawk, which bought mortgages that aren't guaranteed by government agencies near the bottom in early 2009. BlackHawk started trimming its mortgage holdings this summer after a run-up. \n \n PM Report: Foreclosure Mess - How Bad Will It Get? 9:48 Nick Timiraos discusses the unfolding foreclosure-crisis, including how bad it's likely to get, how much it's likely to cost banks and the risk that it could paralyze the housing market. Plus, a health-care ruling and seniors flip for college teams. \n \n News Hub: Bank Stocks Hit on Foreclosure Worries 2:41 Mike Reid looks at how news of the escalating foreclosure mess impacted bank stocks today as well why the market fell then rebounded in late trading. \n \n Bank of America CEO Comments on Moratorium 1:16 Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan comments on when the foreclosure moratorium might be lifted and what impact it could have on the housing market, MarketWatch's Val Brickates Kennedy reports from Boston. \n \n Banks, meanwhile, could be hit with investor lawsuits, and foreclosure delays could bring short-term losses. Some investors are pushing for banks to take back nonperforming mortgages in cases of faulty documentation. \n \n Such worries helped push down shares of Bank of America on Thursday, in their biggest one-day drop since mid-July. Wells Fargo, with its own large mortgage portfolio, fell more than 4%, as did Citigroup Inc. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. dropped 2.8%. \n \n The annual cost of buying five-year credit-default swap protection on $10 million of Bank of America debt rose from $155,000 on Monday to $193,000 on Thursday, with the bulk of the rise coming in the past two days, according to data provider Markit. The cost of protecting similar debt from Wells Fargo rose to $129,000 from $95,000 on Monday. \n \n \"If nothing else, this is creating uncertainty for the banks,\" Nomura Securities bank analyst David Havens wrote in an email. \"Our take is that it could be quite negative for the banks, and the markets are waking up to this very quickly.\" \n \n The latest foreclosure headache is just one in a string for owners of mortgage securities not backed by government agencies. This $1.3 trillion market has yet to fully recover from its implosion starting in 2007. \n \n Estimates of the size of the foreclosure problem are still forming. Some $154 billion in mortgages could be affected by foreclosure delays, according to an estimate this week by Laurie Goodman, senior managing director at mortgage-bond trader Amherst Securities Group LP in New York. \n \n Morgan Stanley trading-desk analyst Greg Gore estimated in a conference call on Tuesday that as much as $134 billion of mortgage bonds held by the nation's four biggest banks could ultimately be affected by foreclosure delays. \n \n For now, many bond investors doubt the damage will be extensive. But wild cards remain. For starters, attorneys general in all 50 states are investigating foreclosures. \n \n Some investors still feel burned by a 2008 settlement between attorneys general and Bank of America, after the bank bought Countrywide Financial. The bank agreed to modify mortgages, and investors say they are bearing the costs unfairly. They fear foreclosure investigations could result in mortgage modifications that once again hurt investors. \n \n In an Oct. 7 ruling, a New York state justice dismissed a lawsuit by investors who argued they shouldn't bear any of the cost of the $8.4 billion settlement. \n \n Mortgage-bond investors will get more information at the end of the month, when they get fresh data on cash flows from the bonds they own. But that data may only partially reflect the impact of recent foreclosure delays. \n \n \u2014Ruth Simon contributed to this article. \n \n Write to Mark Gongloff at mark.gongloff@wsj.com ||||| \u201cI don\u2019t see how it can be cleared up in a short period of time,\u201d said Richard X. Bove, an analyst with Rochdale Securities. \u201cThe moratorium won\u2019t last that long but the problem will last at least four or five years, maybe a decade.\u201d In the short term, he said, \u201cit could easily cost $1.5 billion per quarter.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, the foreclosure machinery in many states has ground to a halt. Major institutions like Bank of America, JPMorgan and GMAC Mortgage have halted foreclosures in many states, and have not said when they would resume. As a result, foreclosed homes will remain on the bank\u2019s books while racking up thousands of dollars a month in extra costs. \n \n Until Thursday, Wall Street regarded the foreclosure issue as a risk to the banks\u2019 reputations, rather than their bottom lines. Indeed, some analysts insisted it was unlikely that wide-scale abuses would be found. \n \n Photo \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s inexcusable that the banks didn\u2019t staff up to meet the surge in foreclosures,\u201d said Christopher Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer. \u201cOn the other hand, we need to look at whether they are filing foreclosures on a massive basis against people who are not delinquent. So far, I haven\u2019t seen any evidence that they are.\u201d \n \n Inside the investment houses, several traders said nerves were frazzled further by worries that banks could face much bigger mortgage related losses, not from foreclosures, but because of questions about how the money was lent in the first place. If it turns out that mortgages were bundled together and sold improperly, more holders could sue the banks and force them to buy back tens of billions in mortgage-backed securities. \n \n An alarming report on Bank of America, compiled by Branch Hill Capital, a San Francisco hedge fund, circulated widely on Wall Street on Thursday. Branch Hill suggested that the bank, the nation\u2019s largest, could be facing more than $70 billion in losses from mortgage securities that it may have to repurchase from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as private investors. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

But the company\u2019s chief executive, Brian T. Moynihan, said last month at an investor conference that adequate reserves had been taken to protect against any losses that could materialize if it was forced to repurchase mortgage securities. \u201cThis will be manageable over time, but it has cost us a lot of money so I\u2019m not making light of it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to manage it.\u201d \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n On Wednesday, JPMorgan said it had added $1 billion to its reserves to cover faulty home loans that it was obligated to repurchase from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and private insurers. It has set aside a total of $3 billion for potential repurchases. \n \n Even if the larger losses envisioned by Mr. Mehta do not materialize, the foreclosure issue remains a worry. In a report, Paul Miller, an analyst with FBR Capital Markets, forecast that the controversy would cost the banking industry $6 billion to $10 billion. He estimated that each month\u2019s delay cost the banks $1,000 per home loan, so if there was a three-month delay on the roughly two million homes currently in foreclosure, that translated into a $6 billion hit. \n \n In addition to the losses directly caused by the delay, Mr. Miller foresees additional charges totaling $3 billion to $4 billion to cover lawsuits stemming from faulty foreclosure procedures. \n \n For now, bank executives are not making any predictions how long the foreclosure halt will last. \n \n \u201cIf you\u2019re talking about three or four weeks it will be a blip in the housing market,\u201d said Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, in a conference call on Wednesday. \u201cIf it went on for a long period of time, it will have a lot of consequences, most of which will be adverse on everybody.\u201d",

    "input": "Scientists have added to the complex and controversial tales of origin surrounding the Turin Shroud, by revealing the myriad locations of the DNA and pollen that are present on the cloth. \n \n The length of linen is highly contentious. Some Christians believe the fabric \u2013 which is kept in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin - is the burial shroud of Jesus of Nazereth, dating back over 2,000 years. \n \n However,previous scientific studies have suggested that the cloth, which appears to be imprinted with the image of a man, may in fact be from the 13th or 14th century - centuries after Jesus is believed to have died. \n \n Now, a new study by Italian researchers published in the prestigious science journal Nature gives a further insight into the potential origins of the cloth. \n \n To make their findings for the paper entitled 'Uncovering the sources of DNA found on the Turin Shroud', the team behind the study sequenced the DNA of pollen and other dust from the cloth. \n \n By doing so, they were able to pinpoint the biogeographic origin of the people who came into contact with the shroud. \n \n The authors found traces on the parchment from people and pollen from around the world, including Europe, south Asia, eastern Africa and the Middle East. \n \n Researchers said that the findings could indicate that that the shroud made its \"historic [...] presumed journey\" from the Near East and was taken around the world before being kept in Italy; or that it has its origins in medieval Europe where and was contaminated by those who travelled to it. \n \n In a further twist, the study indicated that it may have been manufactured in India. ||||| Collection of TS Samples for DNA analyses \n \n The samples used in this study for DNA investigations are sub-sets of the dust particles vacuumed from the back of the Turin Shroud (TS), which were kindly provided in 2010 by Giulio Fanti (Dept. of Industrial Engineering, University of Padua, Italy), who in turn received them personally from Giovanni Riggi di Numana in 200612,18 (see also Supplementary Document S1). In particular, four samples were originally collected on filters in 1978 from four distinct areas of the back of TS, corresponding to the hands (filter E), face (filter F), feet (filter G) and glutei (filter H) of the TS male image12. An additional sample was collected in 1988, deriving specifically from the corner area (filter I) of TS, which was used for radiocarbon dating8,12 (for details, see Supplementary Figure S2, panels A\u2013C). \n \n The dust samples collected on these filters were immobilized on adhesive tapes as previously described6,13 and consisted of a variety of particles. In fact, optical microscope observations of filters E-I had previously revealed the presence of pollen grains, cell debris and other minuscule organic specimens, such as plant-derived fibers and blood-like clots6,7,13. \n \n The five pieces of adhesive tape containing TS dust particles collected on filters E, F, G, H and I were supplied as portions of the original samples (ranging in size from 5 \u00d7 10 mm to 10 \u00d7 30 mm, see the schematic representation in Supplementary Figure S2, panel D), each attached to a sterile microscope slide. Each piece of adhesive tape was manually cut using a scalpel and tweezers under a stereomicroscope into tiny sub-portions of dimensions on the order of a few square millimeters (~5 \u00d7 5 mm each); the pieces were then individually transferred into 1.5-ml sterile microtubes. A total of 2 to 12 square portioned specimens of the pieces of adhesive tape were used for independent genomic DNA extractions; the DNA samples from the individual specimens were kept separate for PCR amplifications. \n \n PCR amplicons obtained from each of the cpDNA regions were sub-cloned and used individually for DNA sequencing, whereas PCR amplicons obtained from each of the mtDNA regions were pooled for 454 sequencing reactions. In particular, the DNA amplicons from each of the 2, 4 or 6 specimens associated with internal filters E, F, G and H were pooled together into single samples, whereas the DNA amplicons from external filter I were divided into two samples of 6 specimens each (named I and I R and taken as independent biological replications; Supplementary Figure S2). This pooling strategy was imposed by the different sizes of the pieces of adhesive tape to be analyzed for each of the five TS filters and by the fact that dust particles were demonstrated to be much more abundant on the tape representing the external filter than on those for the internal filters6,13. \n \n All manipulation steps were performed aseptically under laminar flow hood conditions using autoclaved disposables and buffers that were filter-sterilized. In particular, we used sterile materials and all standard procedures with internal negative controls to avoid, or eventually discover, contaminations from the operators and the environment. The entire mitochondrial genomes of the three operators who came in contact with the Shroud samples were completely sequenced and all mtDNA sequences that we obtained from the TS samples and could be theoretically attributed to operator contamination (Supplementary Table S3) were excluded from our final results. As for possible environmental contaminations, none of the large varieties of plant sources detected in the Shroud (Supplementary Table S1) through the analysis of nuclear ITS, chloroplast genes or cpDNA sequences are grown or studied in our facilities. \n \n Genomic DNA extraction \n \n Specimens from the pieces of adhesive tape with the TS dust particles were used individually for genomic DNA extraction to avoid any loss of TS material and to perform replicate experiments for each TS filter. \n \n All genomic DNA extractions were performed with the QIAamp\u00aeDNA Investigator commercial kit (Qiagen) by applying the protocol originally developed for laser-microdissected specimens, with some modifications. All manipulation steps were performed under laminar flow hood conditions using DNA- and DNase-free, disposable autoclaved materials and filter-sterilized buffers. Immediately after collection, sub-samples were transferred to a 1.5-ml tube containing a pre-warmed mixture composed of 40 \u03bcl of ATL buffer and 20 \u03bcl proteinase K. Each sample was then mixed by pulse-vortexing and incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 16 hours under constant agitation. After this step, 100 \u03bcl of the AL buffer, containing 2 \u03bcg of carrier RNA, was added, and the solution was mixed by pulse-vortexing for 15 sec. Then, 100 \u03bcl absolute ethanol was added, and the solution was mixed thoroughly by pulse-vortexing for 15 sec and then incubated for 5 min at room temperature. The next steps, which consisted of DNA immobilization to a silica membrane and wash steps to clean the isolated DNA from salts and impurities, were conducted by following the manufacturer\u2019s suggestions. Elution of the DNA immobilized by the silica membrane was performed in two steps by using 15 \u03bcl ATE buffer at each elution step and by extending the incubation step to 10 min at room temperature. \n \n To identify human genetic lineages and plant taxonomic entities, specific plant DNA and human mitochondrial DNA regions were designated for PCR amplification and sequencing. \n \n PCR amplification and sequencing of plant and human DNA sequences \n \n PCR amplifications of plant DNA sequences were performed with primer combinations designed using nuclear (rDNA intergenic transcribed spacers, ITS) and chloroplast targets (cpDNA barcodes RuBisCO or rbcL, trnH-psbA, and trnL-intron) (Supplementary Table S4), following already available protocols19,20. Briefly, the reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 \u03bcl that included 2 \u03bcl of 10X reaction buffer, 1 mM MgSO 4 , 0.3 mM dNTPs, 0.25 U of Platinum\u00ae Pfx DNA Polymerase (Life Technologies), 0.3 \u03bcM of primer mix and 2.5 \u03bcl of eluted DNA solution. The reactions were performed in a 9700 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems) using a temperature profile that consisted of an initial denaturation step of 10 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 50 cycles of 1 min at 95 \u00b0C, 30 sec at 55 \u00b0C, 1 min at 68 \u00b0C and a final step of 10 min at 68 \u00b0C. \n \n The same conditions were adopted for PCR amplifications of human sequences corresponding to three distinct mtDNA loci (MT-DLOOP with the hypervariable segments MT-HV1 and MT-HV2, MT-CO1, and MT-ND5) using specific primer pairs (Supplementary Table S4). \n \n The amplicons were sub-cloned by ligation into the TOPO-blunt cloning vector (Life Technologies) and transformed into chemically competent one-shot TOP10 bacterial cells (Life Technologies). Clones were plated on LB plates (1.5% agar, 50 \u03bcg/mL ampicillin, 40 \u03bcg/ml X-Gal), and transformed colonies were selected by Colony-PCR. Amplification reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 \u03bcl including 2 \u03bcl of 10X reaction buffer, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 300 \u03bcM dNTPs, 1.5 U of BIOTaq DNA polymerase (BIOLINE), 0.2 \u03bcM of M13For (5\u2032-GTAAAACGACGGCCAG-3\u2032) and M13Rev (5\u2032-CAGGAAACAGCTATGAC-3\u2032) primers. Positive colonies were sequenced using an ABI3100 automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). \n \n Both nuclear ITS sequences and DNA barcodes were used to identify plant and fungal species21,22, querying the Barcode of Life Data BOLD Systems v. 3 (http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/IDS_OpenIdEngine). Sequence similarity searches in nucleotide collections (nt) and with non-redundant protein sequences (nr) were also performed with blastn/x programs of the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool BLAST v. 2.2.30+ (http://blast.st-va.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) using default parameters. All plant cpDNA and ITS sequences deriving from PCR amplicons were verified through replicated sequencing of both strands and deposited in GenBank with accession numbers JQ007354-JQ007431 and JQ082521-JQ082524. The human mtDNA sequences, as clusters deriving from the assembly of reads generated by 454 sequencing, were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KP126143-KP126230. \n \n For each plant sequence, we collected information regarding: i) the TS location source; ii) the GenBank accession number of the most similar sequence; iii) the Linnaean name of the species, including the botanical family and its common name; iv) the name and length of the target DNA sequence; v) the center of origin and geographical distribution of the species, along with information on plant type and/or common use (for details, see Supplementary Table S1). From an experimental point of view, it should be noted that some species were identified in biological replicates by using different specimens of the same filter as well as different filters but were also assessed by technical replicates according to amplicons from different genetic targets. In addition, other species were identified by performing independent experiments, meaning that the PCR analyses were conducted at different times using DNA samples isolated at different times from the same filters/dust samples. All these cases are pivotal experimental validations and demonstrate the robust assignments of plant species (or genus). \n \n PCR amplification of human mtDNA and preparation of libraries for pyrosequencing \n \n Amplifications of target mtDNA sequences prior to pyrosequencing were performed as described in the previous paragraph using specific primer sets (Supplementary Table S4). It is worth mentioning that the successful amplification of human mtDNA fragments ranging in size from 419 to 576 bp (as well as plant nuclear and chloroplast DNAs from 229 to 622 bp) such as the ones that we amplified, would be mostly possible from undamaged or slightly damaged DNA templates, which is unexpected when dealing with very ancient DNA specimens. However, the size of ancient DNA fragments, in addition to age, is influenced by many additional factors such as environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, moisture and pH) and mode of preservation (e.g., museum specimens vs. freshly excavated remains). In brief, DNA degradation becomes more effective only over long intervals, but is de facto unpredictable over shorter time spans such as those postulated for the DNA traces on the TS and when considering the numerous copies of extra-nuclear DNA molecules23,24,25,26. \n \n PCR products originating from the amplification of multiple samples were pooled (Supplementary Table S4) and purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) by following the recommendations of the supplier. Next, the amplicons of the three different mtDNA target regions were pooled together, as reported in Supplementary Table S5, and purified with the Agencourt AMPure XP procedure (Beckman Coulter) by following the recommendations of the supplier. Quantification of the pooled amplicons was performed with a Nanodrop fluorometer ND 3300 (Thermo Scientific). \n \n Libraries were prepared starting from 100 ng of purified PCR products using Rapid Library Preparation Method (Series GS FLX+; Roche 454 sequencing), starting from step 3.2: Fragment End Repair (thus avoiding the step 3.1, DNA Fragmentation by Nebulization). Single libraries were tagged with univocal MIDs (Supplementary Table S6). Emulsion PCR and 454 sequencing were carried out according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions on the Roche 454 FLX Titanium platform. Library sequencing was carried out using a Roche 454 GS Junior System. \n \n Analysis of sequence reads, variant calling and cluster assembly \n \n Sequence reads were de-multiplexed based on their MID sequence with the Roche 454 software SFFfile. The number of sequenced and aligned reads referring to the single libraries are reported in Supplementary Table S7. \n \n Mapping of the sequence reads to the H. sapiens mitochondrial genome (gb|NC_012920.1) was performed with the software CLC Genomics Workbench version 5.05 with defaults parameters. Mapping of the sequence reads originating from each library was used to estimate the average coverage for each target region. Background noise in the sequences was filtered with a program developed ad hoc that analyzes the composition in words (k-mer) of the produced sequences and masks the words having a frequency lower than the value set as the cutoff. For this step, the length of the k-mers was set to 7, and the minimum frequency parameter was set to 5. After the masking of rare variants, the sequences were clustered with the software CD HIT v.4.5.427 by setting a threshold of percent identity equal to 99%. The average coverage of the mtDNA target regions for each single pool and target region is summarized in Supplementary Table S7. \n \n Sequence clusters with a length greater than 200 bp were aligned to the H. sapiens mitochondrial genome (gb|NC_012920.1) using the program \u201cbwa\u201d28 with default parameters. In this step, each pool of sequences was independently aligned against the reference sequence17. The alignment files were saved as standard SAM files. Variant calling was performed on alignments of sequences representative of each cluster with the software PASS29. For each cluster, the haplotype was defined as the collection of substitutions (either transversions or transitions) that emerged in the variant calling process. Insertions and deletions were not taken into account. \n \n A pre-filtering step for estimation of the mtDNA haplogroups represented in our cluster sequences was performed with the software HaploGrep30, which allows the automatic assignment of haplogroups according to Phylotree31. Preliminary assignments of haplogroups to sequence clusters displaying the highest sequence coverage were manually verified. The frequency of each haplogroup was estimated by the number of sequences contained in each cluster assigned to that specific haplogroup. The distribution of haplogroups in the different samples was estimated as above, but by counting the sequences according to the library information. The assembled human mtDNA sequences were deposited in GenBank with accession numbers KM655881-KM655934 (for details, see Supplementary Table S8). ||||| Editor's Note: This story was updated at 1:55 p.m. E.T. \n \n Is it a medieval fake or a relic of Jesus Christ? A new analysis of DNA from the Shroud of Turin reveals that people from all over the world have touched the venerated garment. \n \n \"Individuals from different ethnic groups and geographical locations came into contact with the Shroud [of Turin] either in Europe (France and Turin) or directly in their own lands of origin (Europe, northeast Africa, Caucasus, Anatolia, Middle East and India),\" study lead author Gianni Barcaccia, a geneticist at the University of Padua in Italy and lead author of the new study describing the DNA analysis, said in an email. \"We cannot say anything more on its origin.\" \n \n The new findings don't rule out either the notion that the long strip of linen is a medieval forgery or that it's the true burial shroud of Jesus Christ, the researchers said. \n \n Long-standing debate \n \n On its face, the Shroud of Turin is an unassuming piece of twill cloth that bears traces of blood and a darkened imprint of a man's body. Though the Catholic Church has never taken an official stance on the object's authenticity, tens of thousands flock to Turin, Italy, every year to get a glimpse of the object, believing that it wrapped the bruised and bleeding body of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion. [Religious Mysteries: 8 Alleged Relics of Jesus] \n \n According to legend, the shroud was secretly carried from Judea in A.D. 30 or 33, and was housed in Edessa, Turkey, and Constantinople (the name for Istanbul before the Ottomans took over) for centuries. After crusaders sacked Constantinople in A.D. 1204, the cloth was smuggled to safety in Athens, Greece, where it stayed until A.D. 1225. \n \n However, the Catholic Church only officially recorded its existence in A.D. 1353, when it showed up in a tiny church in Lirey, France. Centuries later, in the 1980s, radiocarbon dating, which measures the rate at which different isotopes of the carbon atoms decay, suggested the shroud was made between A.D. 1260 and A.D. 1390, lending credence to the notion that it was an elaborate fake created in the Middle Ages. (Isotopes are forms of an element with a different number of neutrons.) \n \n But critics argued that the researchers used patched-up portions of the cloth to date the samples, which could have been much younger than the rest of the garment. \n \n What's more, the Gospel of Matthew notes that \"the earth shook, the rocks split and the tombs broke open\" after Jesus was crucified. So geologists have argued that an earthquake at Jesus' death could have released a burst of neutrons. The neutron burst not only would have thrown off the radiocarbon dating but also would have led to the darkened imprint on the shroud. \n \n Global traveler? \n \n In the current study, Barcaccia and his colleagues analyzed dust that they vacuumed from the shroud that contained traces of both plant and human DNA. \n \n The plant DNA came from all over the world, the researchers reported Oct. 5 in the journal Scientific Reports. European spruce trees; Mediterranean clovers, ryegrasses and plantains; North American black locust trees; and rare East Asian pear and plum trees all left their mark on the cloth. \n \n The team also sequenced the human mitochondrial DNA (DNA passed from mother to child) found in dust from the shroud. The genetic lineage, or haplotype, of the DNA snippets suggested that people ranging from North African Berbers to East Africans to inhabitants of China touched the garment. \n \n Still, the strongest genetic signals seemed to come from areas in and around the Middle East and the Caucasus \u2014 not far from where Jesus was buried, and consistent with the early folklore surrounding the object. [The 10 Most Controversial Miracles] \n \n \"One of the most abundant human mitochondrial haplotypes, among those discovered on the shroud, is still very rare in western Europe, and it is typical of the Druze community, an ethnic group that has some origin in Egypt and that lives mainly in restricted areas between Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel and Palestine,\" Barcaccia told Live Science in an email. \n \n The oldest DNA snippets (which tend to be shorter because DNA breaks down over time) are found in many places on the shroud, and come from genetic lineages typically found only in India, Barcaccia said. That finding suggests that the shroud was manufactured in India before somehow making its way to Europe, as Indians had little contact with Europeans at the time of its origin. \n \n \"In my opinion, it is hard to believe that in the past centuries, in a historical interval spanning the medieval period, different subjects \u2014 such as priests, monks or nuns, as well [as] devotees and other subjects of Indian ancestry \u2014 have had the possibility to come in contact with the shroud in France and/or Turin,\" Barcaccia said. \n \n Unsettled question \n \n But the new results don't settle questions about the shroud's authenticity, said Hugh Farey, editor of the British Society of the Turin Shroud newsletter. [Who Was Jesus, the Man?] \n \n As far as the plant DNA goes, \"they've done a good job, and they've identified a number of species that mean, broadly speaking, nothing at all,\" Farey told Live Science. \n \n The new study suffers from the same issues that made past studies of pollen on the shroud unreliable, said Ren\u00e9e Enevold, a geoscientist at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark who has analyzed ancient pollen in the past. \n \n \"The plant DNA could be from many sources, and there is no way of finding the right source,\" Enevold told Live Science in an email. \"Also, the sub-genus level of taxon that has been reached is not near enough to the species level that is needed to determine the area of origin for each plant.\" \n \n The researchers also mistakenly relied on an interpretative method that is used to analyze thousands of grains of pollen in a lake, she said. In that environment, the conditions that led to the deposition of pollen \u2014 rain and wind, for instance \u2014 are known. In contrast, there are so many unknowns when it comes to describing how dust settled onto the shroud. \n \n \"It is very bold and completely wrong to use the same interpretational approach on the presence of DNA \u2014 or just a few pollen grains, for that matter \u2014 on a shroud that has been man-handled for decades,\" Enevold said. \n \n Given that the cloth was publicly displayed for centuries, it's not surprising that so many people touched it, Farey added. \"Apart from ruling out the United States of America as the source for the shroud, it leaves just about everything else open,\" Farey said. \n \n As for the possible Indian manufacture, it's just as likely that Indian DNA got onto the object during its 20th-century testing, he said. To truly determine where the cloth was manufactured, the researchers would need to analyze the DNA from the flax seeds used to make the linen shroud, which was not done, he added. \n \n Still, Farey said he's about 40 percent convinced the shroud is authentic and about 60 percent inclined to believe it is a forgery. \n \n \"There is a pretty substantial amount of evidence on both sides,\" Farey said. \"So the proper thing to do is to maintain an open mind at the moment.\" \n \n However, using DNA analysis and more sophisticated scientific techniques could ultimately settle the question, Farey said. For instance, geologists can now determine the origin of rock with incredible precision, by analyzing its ratio of isotopes of certain elements. If researchers can one day figure out how to test the isotopes in the limestone dust found on the shroud, they could say with greater certainty whether the shroud was ever in Jerusalem, he said. \n \n Editor's Note: This story was edited to note that the crusaders, not the Ottomans, sacked Constantinople in A.D. 1204.

An Italian team analyzed DNA from the relic some believe is the burial cloth of Jesus but failed to find conclusive proof of its origins, the Independent reports. The testing revealed traces of people and pollen from many parts of the world, meaning it that could be a medieval forgery\u2014or that its journey to Europe could indeed have begun in Jerusalem around 30 or 33AD. The results show that over the centuries, the shroud came in contact with many \"different types of natural and anthropological environments,\" according to the researchers, whose study is published in the journal Nature. One find that will surprise skeptics: One of the most common snippets of mitochondrial DNA was from the Middle East. The type is \"rare in western Europe, and it is typical of the Druze community, an ethnic group that has some origin in Egypt and that lives mainly in restricted areas between Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, and Palestine,\" lead researcher Gianni Barcaccia tells LiveScience, which notes that other experts consider some of the methods used unreliable. Another find: Barcaccia says some of the oldest DNA on the cloth was from India, meaning the shroud may have been made there.

    "input": "The View from the Front Seat of the Google Self-Driving Car \n \n After 1.7 million miles we\u2019ve learned a lot \u2014 not just about our system but how humans drive, too. \n \n Chris Urmson Blocked Unblock Follow Following May 11, 2015 Unlisted \n \n About 33,000 people die on America\u2019s roads every year. That\u2019s why so much of the enthusiasm for self-driving cars has focused on their potential to reduce accident rates. As we continue to work toward our vision of fully self-driving vehicles that can take anyone from point A to point B at the push of a button, we\u2019re thinking a lot about how to measure our progress and our impact on road safety. \n \n One of the most important things we need to understand in order to judge our cars\u2019 safety performance is \u201cbaseline\u201d accident activity on typical suburban streets. Quite simply, because many incidents never make it into official statistics, we need to find out how often we can expect to get hit by other drivers. Even when our software and sensors can detect a sticky situation and take action earlier and faster than an alert human driver, sometimes we won\u2019t be able to overcome the realities of speed and distance; sometimes we\u2019ll get hit just waiting for a light to change. And that\u2019s important context for communities with self-driving cars on their streets; although we wish we could avoid all accidents, some will be unavoidable. \n \n Follow Backchannel: Facebook | Twitter \n \n The most common accidents our cars are likely to experience in typical day to day street driving \u2014 light damage, no injuries \u2014 aren\u2019t well understood because they\u2019re not reported to police. Yet according to National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) data, these incidents account for 55% of all crashes. It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really going on out on the streets unless you\u2019re doing miles and miles of driving every day. And that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve been doing with our fleet of 20+ self-driving vehicles and team of safety drivers, who\u2019ve driven 1.7 million miles (manually and autonomously combined). The cars have self-driven nearly a million of those miles, and we\u2019re now averaging around 10,000 self-driven miles a week (a bit less than a typical American driver logs in a year), mostly on city streets. \n \n In the spirit of helping all of us be safer drivers, we wanted to share a few patterns we\u2019ve seen. A lot of this won\u2019t be a surprise, especially if you already know that driver error causes 94% of crashes. \n \n If you spend enough time on the road, accidents will happen whether you\u2019re in a car or a self-driving car. Over the 6 years since we started the project, we\u2019ve been involved in 11 minor accidents (light damage, no injuries) during those 1.7 million miles of autonomous and manual driving with our safety drivers behind the wheel, and not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident. \n \n Rear-end crashes are the most frequent accidents in America, and often there\u2019s little the driver in front can do to avoid getting hit; we\u2019ve been hit from behind seven times, mainly at traffic lights but also on the freeway. We\u2019ve also been side-swiped a couple of times and hit by a car rolling through a stop sign. And as you might expect, we see more accidents per mile driven on city streets than on freeways; we were hit 8 times in many fewer miles of city driving. All the crazy experiences we\u2019ve had on the road have been really valuable for our project. We have a detailed review process and try to learn something from each incident, even if it hasn\u2019t been our fault. \n \n Not only are we developing a good understanding of minor accident rates on suburban streets, we\u2019ve also identified patterns of driver behavior (lane-drifting, red-light running) that are leading indicators of significant collisions. Those behaviors don\u2019t ever show up in official statistics, but they create dangerous situations for everyone around them. \n \n Lots of people aren\u2019t paying attention to the road. In any given daylight moment in America, there are 660,000 people behind the wheel who are checking their devices instead of watching the road. Our safety drivers routinely see people weaving in and out of their lanes; we\u2019ve spotted people reading books, and even one playing a trumpet. A self-driving car has people beat on this dimension of road safety. With 360 degree visibility and 100% attention out in all directions at all times; our newest sensors can keep track of other vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians out to a distance of nearly two football fields. \n \n Intersections can be scary places. Over the last several years, 21% of the fatalities and about 50% of the serious injuries on U.S. roads have involved intersections. And the injuries are usually to pedestrians and other drivers, not the driver running the red light. This is why we\u2019ve programmed our cars to pause briefly after a light turns green before proceeding into the intersection \u2014 that\u2019s often when someone will barrel impatiently or distractedly through the intersection. \n \n In this case, a cyclist (the light blue box) got a late start across the intersection and narrowly avoided getting hit by a car making a left turn (the purple box entering the intersection) who didn\u2019t see him and had started to move when the light turned green. Our car predicted the cyclist\u2019s behavior (the red path) and did not start moving until the cyclist was safely across the intersection. \n \n Turns can be trouble. We see people turning onto, and then driving on, the wrong side of the road a lot \u2014 particularly at night, it\u2019s common for people to overshoot or undershoot the median. \n \n In this image you can see not one, but two cars (the two purple boxes on the left of the green path are the cars you can see in the photo) coming toward us on the wrong side of the median; this happened at night on one of Mountain View\u2019s busiest boulevards. \n \n Other times, drivers do very silly things when they realize they\u2019re about to miss their turn. \n \n A car (the purple box touching the green rectangles with an exclamation mark over it) decided to make a right turn from the lane to our left, cutting sharply across our path. The green rectangles, which we call a \u201cfence,\u201d indicate our car is going to slow down to avoid the car making this crazy turn. \n \n And other times, cars seem to behave as if we\u2019re not there. In the image below, a car in the leftmost turn lane (the purple box with a red fence through it) took the turn wide and cut off our car. In this case, the red fence indicates our car is stopping and avoiding the other vehicle. \n \n These experiences (and countless others) have only reinforced for us the challenges we all face on our roads today. We\u2019ll continue to drive thousands of miles so we can all better understand the all too common incidents that cause many of us to dislike day to day driving \u2014 and we\u2019ll continue to work hard on developing a self-driving car that can shoulder this burden for us. \n \n Chris Urmson is director of Google\u2019s self-driving car program. \n \n Follow Backchannel: Twitter | Facebook ||||| Eleven driverless vehicles have been involved in minor accidents on California roads over the past six years during testing, Google said Monday, stressing that none of its cars were at fault in any of the incidents. \n \n The company made the admission after a reported from the Associated Press said two Google driverless cars, while controlled by computers, were involved in accidents since last fall when the state gave the company official permission to start testing the technology on public roads. Nobody was hurt in any of the crashes, Google said. \n \n But in the wake of the accidents, the police reports were not made public in accordance with California law. Google did not release the reports either \u2014 a practice could hurt the very future of driverless cars that several technology companies are trying to build. \n \n Proponents of self-driving cars argue that computer-driven vehicles can help improve automotive safety by reacting more quickly to oncoming dangers and keeping a better eye on the environment, reducing the risk of driver error. But the public lacks objective data about whether that\u2019s true in practice or even potentially true. \n \n Earning drivers\u2019 trust is going to be one of the biggest challenges for driverless car manufacturers. Giving up the steering wheel to a computer just won\u2019t come naturally to many people. Nor will the prospect of having to share the road with machines that can make their own decisions. \n \n \u201dSafety is our highest priority,\u201d said Google in a statement. \u201cSince the start of our program six years ago, we\u2019ve driven nearly a million miles autonomously, on both freeways and city streets, and the self-driving car hasn\u2019t caused a single accident.\u201d \n \n Add it all up and the message seems pretty clear: The autopilot was not the problem. \n \n But what would really bolster people\u2019s confidence is if the companies could prove that the autopilot performed well at preventing or avoiding a crash \u2014 not merely that it wasn\u2019t the cause of a crash. \n \n In two of the crashes, according to the AP, the driverless car features were engaged and no human was behind the wheel. Understanding exactly how the self-driving cars behaved under these conditions \u2014 and in similar situations to come \u2014 will be the key to showing whether driverless cars really are better or safer than humans behind the wheel. \n \n Imagine a world in which driverless cars are the only types of car on the road. In this hypothetical universe, driverless cars are completely safe. Each vehicle behaves predictably according to its programming, so the interactions between those cars become predictable events as well. In this universe, the inattentiveness, speeding, road rage and the half-dozen other reasons accidents happen today would have been eradicated. \n \n The world we inhabit today is far messier. For the foreseeable future, self-driving cars will have to respond to all the crazy things human drivers do, such as cutting other people off, texting behind the wheel, or driving drunk. \n \n If the police reports show there was nothing the autopilot could have done to prevent a crash, that\u2019s a clear point in favor of driverless car manufacturers \u2014 especially if the reports also suggest that a human driver would have fared no better. \n \n But suppose the crashes involved a head-on collision with an 18-wheeler whose lights were flashing and horn was blasting, and the driverless car missed all the signs. That would be a big problem. \n \n The fact that we don\u2019t really know, and that the state of California won\u2019t release the reports, could become a setback for the adoption of driverless cars. We are left with voluntary disclosures by individual manufacturers to fill the gap. On Monday, Google published a post explaining that its cars have been in 11 \u201cminor\u201d accidents, 7 of which occurred when another driver rear-ended them. The blog post also highlights cases where the autopilot successfully avoided crash risks even as other drivers were behaving dangerously in the situation. But the full police reports were not released. \n \n This type of crash and near-crash information, particularly on a large scale, could help consumers make informed decisions about whether to get a self-driving car if and when they finally make it to market. ||||| Internet search company Google Inc's self-driving cars have been involved in 11 accidents, but have not been the cause of any, over the last six years since the project began, the program's director said on Monday. \n \n A team of drivers that is testing the fleet of more than 20 vehicles have driven 1.7 million miles so far. \n \n \"...Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,\" Chris Urmson said in a post on technology news website Backchannel's blog Medium.

Of the nearly 50 self-driving cars rolling around California... (Associated Press) \n \n The company released the number Monday after The Associated Press reported that Google had notified California of three collisions involving its self-driving cars since September, when reporting all accidents became a legal requirement as part of the permits for the tests on public roads. \n \n The director of Google's self-driving car project wrote in a web post that all 11 accidents were minor \u2014 \"light damage, no injuries\" \u2014 and happened over 1.7 million miles of testing, including nearly 1 million miles in self-driving mode. \n \n \"Not once was the self-driving car the cause of the accident,\" wrote Google's Chris Urmson. \n \n It was not possible to independently verify Google's assertions about the fault and nature of the collisions. The company would not release accident documentation, and the California Department of Motor Vehicles said it could not discuss details, citing confidentiality. The agency has licensed just 48 of these test cars. \n \n An accident caused by a self-driving car is a fear of the people developing them, whether at Google or one of the traditional automakers. That's not just because if the accident is particularly horrific, public and political acceptance of the technology would suffer badly. It's also because the reaction to the first car-caused accident will set a precedent in terms of financial liability. \n \n \"Assuming that you are not dead, you are in a much better positon than if you had been hit by an ordinary, human-driven vehicle,\" said Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina who has studied issues about the cars. \n \n That's because the company behind the car will have deep pockets. California law makes it hard for any but major companies or very wealthy individual to test the cars. Each one requires $5 million worth of insurance. \n \n Given the potential for bad publicity, the company will have strong incentive to settle any lawsuit quickly and generously, Smith said. \n \n Three other states have passed laws welcoming tests of self-driving cars onto their roads. Regulators in Nevada, Michigan and Florida told The Associated Press that they weren't aware of any accidents. \n \n If a car in self-driving mode hits a pedestrian, the case becomes a matter of product liability. \n \n California law has a definition of a design defect that would favor a person who is hit, said Robert W. Peterson, insurance law expert and law professor at Santa Clara University. \n \n If the car \"fails to behave in a way which a reasonable consumer would expect it to behave, that is a defect,\" Peterson said. The cars have a clear picture of their surroundings more than a football field away. If a person reasonably expects that one of the cars would stop rather than strike, that could create liability. \n \n Because the cars are required to record and store the last 30 seconds of a data before any accident, reconstructing what happened should be easier, at least. \n \n Google has modified 23 Lexus SUVs registered with DMV. \n \n The parts supplier Delphi Automotive had one accident, which an accident report the company provided the AP showed was not its fault. Delphi said at the time the car was being driven by the person the DMV requires behind the wheel during testing. \n \n ___ \n \n Contact Justin Pritchard at http://twitter.com/lalanewsman. ||||| Google said Monday that its self-driving cars had been involved in 11 \u201cminor\u201d accidents in the past six years, a disclosure the company hopes will assuage concern about the safety of the technology, but may have the opposite effect. \n \n Chris Urmson, head of Google\u2019s self-driving car program, said in a blog post that the accidents caused no injuries and only \u201clight damage.\u201d Google\u2019s cars were not the cause of any of the incidents, he added. He said Google\u2019s cars had driven 1.7 million miles over the period.",

Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving initiative, writes in a Medium blog post that its vehicles\u2014which have logged 1.7 million miles\u2014had accidents that involved \"light damage, no injuries\"; seven of the cars were rear-ended (usually at traffic lights) and most of the accidents took place on city streets, not highways, Reuters notes. Urmson also lists other reasons why cars may get into accidents other than not having a driver: tricky intersections and turns, people not paying attention (he even cites one driver spotted playing the trumpet). The accidents are being labeled as minor and somewhat typical\u2014Urmson notes \"if you spend enough time on the road, accidents will happen whether you're in a car or a self-driving car\"\u2014 and advocates for driverless cars say they actually improve safety because the cars are constantly scanning the environment for accident-causing factors and may react more quickly, the Washington Post notes. A nonprofit watchdog is trying to get both Google and the California DMV to release full reports for these accidents and any future incidents, but that doesn't seem to be happening: The DMV is citing confidentiality laws and won't give access, while Google (for now) is declining comment, per the Wall Street Journal.

    "input": "Donald Trump, the celebrity mogul whose brash and un\u00ador\u00adtho\u00addox presidential bid was counted out time and again, became the de facto Republican nominee Tuesday night after a runaway victory in Indiana\u2019s primary forced his two GOP rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, to quit the race. \n \n Trump overcame a spirited last stand by Cruz \u2014 and a patchwork movement of Republicans working desperately to derail him in fear that his polarizing politics could doom the party \u2014 to gallop to the nomination. Indiana\u2019s results positioned him to easily accumulate the 1,237 delegates required to avert a contested convention. \n \n Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus declared Trump the \u201cpresumptive nominee\u201d and urged all Republicans to unite behind him. \n \n Cruz dropped out Tuesday night in the aftermath of the drubbing, saying he saw no path forward to the nomination. Kasich, who won only his home state of Ohio, is set to announce his departure from the race later Wednesday in Columbus. \n \n [Kasich to leave GOP race after a sunny campaign in a season of anger] \n \n Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) suspended his presidential campaign May 3 after suffering a stinging loss in the Indiana primary to Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump. (Reuters) \n \n On the Democratic side, Indiana proved a surprising aberration as Bernie Sanders scored an upset victory over Hillary Clinton, giving the Vermont senator a needed psychological boost and a fresh rationale to soldier on against increasingly difficult odds. \n \n But Sanders\u2019s success did not change the overall trajectory of the Democratic race, which remains strongly in the former secretary of state\u2019s favor. Clinton holds what her campaign and many analysts argue is an irreversible lead in total delegates. Although she has not clinched the nomination, she has shifted her focus to a likely general election campaign against Trump. \n \n In Indiana, a large manufacturing state battered by shifts in the global economy, Trump and Sanders triumphed on the power of their populist pitches against free trade as well as by channeling the passions of voters who are distrustful of the nation\u2019s political and economic systems. \n \n As Trump claimed the mantle of GOP standard-bearer on Tuesday night, he was uncharacteristically measured. He remarked on his unlikely journey \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s been some unbelievable day and evening and year . . . a beautiful thing to behold\u201d \u2014 and promised Republicans that he would not let them down. \u201cWe\u2019re going to win big league, believe me,\u201d he said at Trump Tower in New York. \u201cWe\u2019re going after Hillary Clinton. She will not be a great president. She will not be a good president. She will be a poor president.\u201d \n \n Clinton, who campaigned Tuesday in the general election battleground of Ohio, now has her focus squarely on Trump. In a statement acknowledging Trump\u2019s status as presumptive nominee, Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said, \u201cThroughout this campaign, Donald Trump has demonstrated that he\u2019s too divisive and lacks the temperament to lead our nation and the free world. With so much at stake, Donald Trump is simply too big of a risk.\u201d \n \n The Hoosier State\u2019s results capped an especially explosive day in the Republican race. In a last gasp on Tuesday morning, Cruz unloaded a litany of personal charges against Trump \u2014 a striking shift in tone that conveyed both the Texas senator\u2019s frustrations with his fading fortunes and his freedom to finally speak his mind about the rival he once praised lavishly. \n \n [The Fix\u2019s winners and losers from Indiana primary night] \n \n Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump held a campaign event at Trump Tower in Manhattan, after sweeping the Indiana primary. (Victoria Walker/The Washington Post) \n \n But as Trump savored what his family members described as a shocking evening, he strived to be magnanimous in his remarks and singled out Cruz for praise. \u201cTed Cruz \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he likes me or he doesn\u2019t like me, but he is one hell of a competitor,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe is a tough, smart guy. And he has got an amazing future.\u201d \n \n Moments earlier, Cruz gave an emotional concession speech in Indianapolis. Flanked by his family and running mate Carly Fiorina, he said: \u201cWe left it all on the field in Indiana. We gave it everything we\u2019ve got. But the voters chose another path. And so with a heavy heart but with boundless optimism for the long-term future of our nation, we are suspending our campaign.\u201d \n \n In a GOP race that began with 17 candidates \u2014 including four sitting governors, four sitting senators and an astoundingly well-funded scion of the Bush political dynasty \u2014 it was Trump who won over the party\u2019s most restive and confrontational voters. He looks to California, which awards 172 delegates on June 7, the final day of primary voting, to make his nomination officially secure. \n \n Trump faces an immediate challenge to unify the fractured GOP. There are already clear fissures, with Republicans Mark Salter, a former top adviser to Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), and Ben Howe, an editor of RedState, tweeting \u201cI\u2019m with her\u201d \u2014 meaning they support Clinton. \n \n Kasich held no public appearance on Tuesday night and scrapped plans to hold a news conference Wednesday morning at Washington Dulles International Airport. He will read a statement announcing the end of his campaign at 5 p.m. Wednesday, according to senior advisers. \n \n Kasich entered the race with an impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9: 18 years in the House, where he built a reputation as a budget cutter; a stint as a Fox News Channel host; and five years as the popular governor of a presidential swing state. He ran as a pragmatic conservative, one had defied his own party and expanded Medicaid, the federal health-care program for the poor, in Ohio. The message never caught on, and Kasich struggled to attract both fundraising and attention. \n \n [The question of the moment: What will Trump be like as GOP nominee?] \n \n For Cruz, the last days of the race in Indiana were a painful demonstration that his time had run out. After Trump\u2019s landslide April victories in six consecutive Northeast and Mid-Atlantic primaries, Cruz saw Indiana as an essential lifeline. His political operation went into overdrive, and he barnstormed Indiana as hard as any state since the kickoff Iowa caucuses. His allied super PACs spent millions of dollars advertising in the state. \n \n Cruz\u2019s moves over the past week signaled desperation. He struck a nonaggression pact with Kasich, who effectively pulled out of Indiana to give Cruz a one-on-one shot against Trump in exchange for Cruz ceding coming primaries in Oregon and New Mexico. \n \n Cruz also named Fiorina as a running mate, and the two of them hurled fiery insults at Trump on the stump. Cruz escalated his rhetoric at a news conference Tuesday, labeling Trump \u201cutterly amoral,\u201d a \u201cserial philanderer\u201d and a \u201cbraggadocious, arrogant buffoon,\u201d among other slurs. \n \n None of it worked. Pre-primary polls showed Trump the chief beneficiary of the Cruz-Kasich deal and pulling farther ahead. \n \n [Cruz unloads on Trump: A \u2018narcissist at a level I don\u2019t think this country has ever seen\u2019] \n \n Trump left nothing to chance. Unlike in some earlier contests, his campaign aired television ads and ran a sizable field operation while the candidate kept up a busy schedule of massive rallies. Trump toured the state with retired Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight. \n \n Cruz, meanwhile, was beset by bad luck. The Fiorina announcement was overtaken by news that former House speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) had disparaged Cruz as \u201cLucifer in the flesh.\u201d Cruz won a hard-sought endorsement from Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, but it drew notice instead for being markedly mealy-mouthed. Pro-Trump hecklers personally confronted Cruz outside one of his events. And Fiorina fell off a campaign stage. \n \n Cruz\u2019s frustrations boiled over Tuesday. After Trump attacked Cruz by referring to an unsubstantiated National Enquirer story alleging that Cruz\u2019s father, Rafael, was connected to President John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassin, Cruz unleashed his tirade. \n \n [GOP elites are now resigned to Donald Trump as their nominee] \n \n Buoying Trump, 6 in 10 Indiana Republican voters \u2014 a larger share than in most previous contests \u2014 said they wanted the next president to come from outside the political establishment, according to preliminary exit polling reported by ABC News. \n \n Similarly, nearly half of Indiana\u2019s Republican voters were supportive of deporting undocumented immigrants, while that figure in earlier contests averaged 41 percent, the data showed. And more Republicans said that Cruz had run the most unfair campaign than said so of Trump, according to the exit polling. \n \n Trump neutralized Cruz\u2019s support from demographic groups \u2014 evangelicals, college graduates and voters who describe themselves as very conservative \u2014 that in previous primaries backed the Texan heavily, exit polling showed. \n \n On the Democratic side, Clinton\u2019s earlier victories were so commanding that she could withstand even a string of lopsided losses in May and still secure the nomination. Sanders has pledged to remain in the race until the end, even though his fundraising has slowed considerably and the scale of his political operation has been downsized accordingly. \n \n But Sanders told reporters Tuesday night that he felt \u201ca great deal of momentum.\u201d \n \n \u201cI sense some great victories coming,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd I think while the path is narrow, and I do not deny that for a moment, I think we can pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States.\u201d \n \n David A.

But in terms of the delegate math, his path to the Democratic nomination hasn't gotten any easier. \n \n Clinton is now 92 percent of the way to clinching the Democratic nomination. \n \n With 83 Indiana delegates at stake, Sanders will gain at least 43. Clinton picked up at least 37. Three delegates remain to be allocated, pending final vote tallies. \n \n That means based on primaries and caucuses to date, Clinton now has 1,682 and Sanders has 1,361. \n \n Clinton's lead is bigger when including superdelegates, or party officials who can back any candidate. \n \n She has 2,202, or 181 delegates away from the 2,383 needed to win, keeping her on track to clinch the nomination by early June. Sanders has 1,400. \n \n If he still hopes to win the nomination, Sanders would need to win more than 84 percent of the remaining delegates and superdelegates. \n \n ___ \n \n 10:40 p.m. \n \n Donald Trump has a clear path to the Republican nomination for president, but he still has some work to do to clinch it. \n \n Mathematically, Trump cannot reach the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination until June 7, the last day of the primary season. \n \n He needs just 42 percent of the remaining delegates to get there. His chances are good. \n \n Trump's last remaining rival, John Kasich, has won just one state, his home state of Ohio. Since then, Kasich has collected a total of nine delegates. \n \n Kasich is fourth in the race for delegates, behind Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, who have suspended their campaigns. \n \n Trump won at least 51 delegates in Indiana, with six delegates remaining. \n \n The AP delegate count: \n \n Trump: 1,047. \n \n Cruz: 565. \n \n Kasich: 152. \n \n ___ \n \n 10:30 p.m. \n \n Donald Trump Jr. is describing his father's emergence as the presumptive Republican nominee as \"surreal.\" \n \n Trump's son says he was with his father, watching TV with the rest of their family when the news that rival Ted Cruz was dropping out of the race broke. \n \n \"I think it was just sort of a collective, 'Wow.' I don't think there were a lot of words spoken,\" he describes. \"I think we're just incredibly shocked.\" \n \n Trump Jr. says they'd assumed Trump's rivals would \"be in it all the way 'til the end.\" \n \n He says his father's message is now focused on \"party unity, bring everyone together. Let's focus on the real prize.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 9:50 p.m. \n \n Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders tells The Associated Press that he has won a \"great upset victory\" in Indiana over rival Hillary Clinton and he expects \"more victories in the weeks to come.\" \n \n The Vermont senator said Tuesday \"the Clinton campaign thinks this campaign is over. They're wrong.\" \n \n He said he has an \"uphill climb\" to the nomination but he's \"in this campaign to win and we are going to fight until the last vote is cast.\" \n \n Sanders said he wants to debate Clinton in California. \n \n ___ \n \n 9:40 p.m. \n \n And then there were two. A strategist for Donald Trump's remaining rival, John Kasich, says the Ohio governor will continue his fight for the Republican nomination until the end. \n \n John Weaver said in a statement Tuesday that \"as long as it remains possible. Gov. Kasich will fight for the higher path.\" \n \n GOP candidate Ted Cruz ended his bid for the nomination Tuesday following a crushing defeat in Indiana's primary. Kasich was running a distant third in the race before Cruz suspended his campaign. \n \n Weaver said \"Cruz ran a strong campaign, stood for conservative principles, and exposed a lot about Donald Trump.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 9:35 p.m. \n \n Donald Trump is telling supporters in New York that Hillary Clinton \"will be a poor president.\" \n \n Trump, who struck a far more somber tone Tuesday than in his rallies, saluted Ted Cruz, his former Republican rival, who suspended his campaign earlier in the night, and shifted his attention instead to his likely opponent in the general election. \n \n Trump said Cruz's decision was \"a brave thing to do\" in the name of party unity. \n \n He also saluted the Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, who Trump joked had started the primary process \"with 17 egos\" ?\u2014 the number of GOP candidates \u2014? and was now \"down to one.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 9:25 p.m. \n \n Donald Trump is shifting his focus to Hillary Clinton. \n \n The Republican front-runner addressed supporters at Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday night after his chief Republican rival, Ted Cruz dropped out.

He says she wants to close mines and he promised to help coal miners get back to work. \n \n ___ \n \n 9:23 p.m. \n \n Bernie Sanders is the winner of Indiana's Democratic primary, scoring a late victory over front-runner Hillary Clinton. \n \n But it's a win that won't change the reality of the Democratic race. \n \n The Vermont senator is far behind the former secretary of state in the delegate count. He won't win by a large enough margin Tuesday to keep Clinton from collecting at least some delegates. \n \n Clinton entered the night with 91 percent of the delegates she needs to become the first woman nominated by a major party. \n \n __ \n \n 9:05 p.m. \n \n The chairman of the Republican National Committee is calling for unity, saying that Donald Trump will be the \"presumptive\" Republican nominee for president. \n \n Reince Priebus took to Twitter Tuesday after Ted Cruz ended his bid for the GOP nomination, saying that Donald Trump \"will be presumptive @GOP nominee, we need to unite and focus on defeating @HillaryClinton.\" He ended his message with the hashtag #NeverClinton. \n \n Trump is due to speak at the Trump Tower in New York City later Tuesday. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:55 p.m. \n \n Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump's campaign staff and supporters are exchanging hugs and handshakes as rival Ted Cruz formally announced his exit from the race. \n \n Trump's team gathered at his Trump Tower in New York City Tuesday where the Republican front-runner is scheduled to speak shortly. \n \n Cheers broke out in the building's grand lobby as a television broadcasting Cruz's speech announced his departure from the race. \n \n ___ \n \n 8:20 p.m. \n \n Texas Sen. Ted Cruz is ending his presidential campaign, eliminating the biggest impediment to Donald Trump's march to the Republican nomination. \n \n Cruz's campaign said he plans to drop out of the race Tuesday following his loss in Indiana's Republican primary to Trump. \n \n Cruz's campaign placed its hopes on a data-driven effort to turn out conservative evangelical Christians who had opted out of recent presidential elections. Increasingly, he would modify his travel schedule to go where data showed there might be pockets of untapped supporters. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:41 p.m. \n \n Donald Trump is thanking voters in Indiana after his big win in the state's Republican presidential primary. \n \n Trump took to Twitter Tuesday, shortly after his big win which gives him a big boost toward reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination. \n \n \"Thank you Indiana,\" Trump wrote. \"We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget!\" \n \n Trump's win dealt a big blow to rival Ted Cruz, who had poured time and resources into the state, which is home to a significant evangelical population. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:40 p.m. \n \n Bernie Sanders is steering clear of Indiana's primary, opening his rally in Kentucky on Tuesday night by pointing to his progress in the Democratic presidential campaign. \n \n Sanders isn't making any predictions about the outcome of Tuesday's primary in Indiana, saying instead that he has closed the big lead that Hillary Clinton had when he started his campaign a year ago. \n \n Sanders says in Louisville he's winning the vote of people age 45 and under. He says that shows that his campaign is fighting for the ideas that are important to the future of the country \"and the future of the Democratic party.\" \n \n Sanders traveled the state and spent about $1.5 million in advertising in Indiana against Clinton. The former secretary of state did not air TV ads and did not campaign extensively in Indiana. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:20 p.m. \n \n As Donald Trump celebrates his win in Indiana's presidential primary, Democratic candidates are awaiting to hear who will walk away with most of the state's Democratic delegates. \n \n Becky Hollenberg, a 32-year-old attorney with the YWCA in Elkhart where she helps people get protective orders against their abusers, said she voted for front-runner Hillary Clinton. \n \n \"I think she has good experience. I think she's really going to be able to be the good leader for the country that we're looking for,\" Hollenberg said. \n \n Hollenberg also said many of the people she works with through the YWCA need better-paying jobs. She also likes how Clinton promotes women's rights. \n \n Ben Swisher, 41, of Indianapolis stopped at the Broad Ripple Park Family Center in Indianapolis to vote for Bernie Sanders, saying he likes that the senator from Vermont hasn't taken a lot of money from big corporations. \n \n \"I've found that a lot of the decisions the government has made in the last several years ... have been based on what would benefit a large corporation and not the American people in general,\" he said. \n \n Polls closed at 7 p.m. Eastern but the winner of the Democratic primary is not yet known. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:05 p.m. \n \n Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz is holding an Indiana primary party inside Indianapolis's ornate Union Station, but only about a third of the available space was occupied with his backers. \n \n The smaller than usual election night crowd Tuesday was subdued as they awaited Cruz, once breaking out into boos and chants of \"Never Trump!\" when a pro-Trump ad came on TV in the hall. \n \n Donald Trump has won the state primary, clinching at least 45 delegates, putting him on a solid path to the nomination. \n \n Cruz's campaign switched from showing televised election results on a big screen to an internal TV feed as the race was called for Trump. Country singer Dierks Bentley's song \"I'll Hold On\" played in the hall as his supporters chatted, ate snacks and drank. \n \n Cruz is due to address his supporters shortly. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:01 p.m. \n \n Donald Trump will collect at least 45 delegates for his victory in Indiana, putting him on a solid path to clinch the nomination and avoid a contested convention. \n \n There are still 12 delegates left to be allocated. \n \n Trump needs to win just 43 percent of the remaining delegates to capture the nomination by the end of the primaries on June 7. \n \n He has won a majority of the delegates allocated so far. \n \n Trump's rivals, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, have been mathematically eliminated from reaching the 1,237 delegates needed to win the nomination before the convention. Their only hope is to block Trump and force a contested convention in which no one arrives with a majority of the delegates. \n \n The AP delegate count: \n \n Trump: 1,041. \n \n Cruz: 565. \n \n Kasich: 152. \n \n ___ \n \n 7:00 p.m. \n \n Donald Trump has won the Republican presidential primary in Indiana, continuing his surge toward clinching the GOP nomination. \n \n The win for Trump is a blow to Ted Cruz, who will fall further behind the billionaire in the race for the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the Republican nomination. \n \n Among his supporters Tuesday was Roger Willett, a 51-year-old Republican who says he has been a Trump supporter since the businessman's campaign began. \n \n Willett works as a driver escorting oversize truck loads and complained that the economy in rural western Indiana offers few prospects, particularly for people just getting out of school. He says he's tired of voting for career politicians and called Trump \"a working man, for us.\" \n \n ___ \n \n 5:18 p.m. \n \n The economy is weighing heavily on the minds of Indiana voters as they cast ballots in their state's primary election. \n \n More than 9 in 10 Republican primary voters and more than 8 in 10 Democratic primary voters are either very or somewhat worried about the economy, according to early results from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. \n \n Asked about some specific economic issues, two-thirds of Democratic primary voters say Wall Street mostly hurts the economy. And they're evenly divided over whether trade with other countries mostly helps or hurts the American economy. \n \n ___ \n \n 5:12 p.m. \n \n Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have both attacked their parties' nomination processes. They've also gone after their opponents for what they say are unfair tactics. But Indiana voters on both sides don't see much of a fairness gap in the presidential race. \n \n Only a third of GOP voters say their party's nomination process has been unfair, according to early results from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. \n \n When it comes to tactics, most Democratic primary voters don't see either Sanders or former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton as having attacked the other unfairly. \n \n Republican primary voters were about equally likely to say that each of the top two candidates ran the most unfair campaign. Four in 10 voters say Trump did, while four in 10 say Texas Sen. Ted Cruz did. \n \n ___ \n \n 5:04 p.m. \n \n Indiana Democrats voting in the state's primary election say they've been energized by their party's nominating process, while most GOP voters say their party has been divided by the political sparring among their top candidates. \n \n That's according to early results from exit polls conducted for The Associated Press and television networks by Edison Research. \n \n Three-quarters of Indiana Democrats in Tuesday's election say they think the nominating process has energized rather than divided their party.

The murders executed by family members on the orders of a jirga of elders of the Mohmand tribe. \n \n First to fall prey to misconstrued notions of honour was the 15-year-old girl. By the next sunrise, the 17-year-old boy too was no more. \n \n Over the next few days, their bodies simply disappeared, buried in the dark of night. There was no mourning, no last rites and no prayers for the departed. \n \n Any reader would be forgiven for assuming this brutal tragedy occurred somewhere in the tribal reaches of the country. But this was in Karachi, the largest urban centre of Pakistan, where the laws of the country apply in full force. \n \n The area where this atrocity played out was Ali Brohi Goth, a locality in the suburbs of Karachi that falls with the jurisdiction of the Ibrahim Hyderi police. \n \n As per information garnered from local residents and police sources, the wheels of tribal \u2018justice\u2019 were set in motion on August 14, the day the country celebrated 70 years of its existence. \n \n The girl, 15-year-old Bakht Taj, daughter of Hikmat Khan, had allegedly attempted to elope with 17-year-old Rehman, son of Muhammad Afzal. Both families belong to the Safi sub-clan of the Mohmand tribe and reside in Ali Brohi Goth. \n \n On Independence Day, Taj disappeared from her house with cash and jewellery. While she stayed at a house in the nearby area of Gulshan-e-Buner, Rehman was to remain at his own home so as to not arouse suspicion. \n \n As Taj\u2019s frantic parents scoured their daughter\u2019s room for any clue to her whereabouts, they soon found a mobile SIM card registered in Rehman\u2019s name. The oversight would prove fatal for the teenage couple as the elders managed to track Taj down and brought her home on the same day. \n \n A broken agreement \n \n Realising the gravity of the matter, Rehman\u2019s father, Afzal, visited Taj\u2019s house to meet her father, Hikmat, and extended a marriage proposal. Knowing well the possibility of violent retribution from Taj\u2019s family, Afzal relied on another archaic tribal practice, Swara (offering girls of the family for marriage), to pacify Taj\u2019s parents. \n \n Along with promising to give two of his daughters for marriage, Afzal offered to bear all the expenses of Taj and Rehman\u2019s wedding and also proffered a cow as compensation. \n \n Sources who followed the developments told The News that Taj\u2019s family had accepted Afzal\u2019s offer. An agreement was reached between the two families and over a dozen elders of the Mohmand tribe residing in Ali Brohi Goth, Sherpao Colony and Muslimabad gathered on August 15 for a jirga to conclude the matter. \n \n It was there that a staunchly conservative elder, Sartaj Khan alias Shagalai, raised objections to the agreement. In his rigid view, the jirga had to punish the teenagers to discourage such acts in the future and their families had to be the ones to kill their children, all to save their and the tribe\u2019s \u2018honour\u2019. \n \n Murder most foul \n \n Shagalai\u2019s contentions swayed the jirga members and the orders for cold-blooded murder were passed. The adolescents, though, were to die separately. \n \n Taj\u2019s life was taken first. Her father and uncle, Zar Khattab, made her consume a strong sedative and then tied the unconscious girl to a charpoy. She was then administered powerful electric shocks to end her life. \n \n Taj was buried that night in secrecy by five tribesmen at the Maula Madad graveyard in Sherpao Colony. The next day, Rehman\u2019s family was made to repeat the same harrowing exercise with their own flesh and blood. \n \n Rehman\u2019s father, Afzal, had opposed the decision but, according to his relatives, one of the jirga members threatened to have his family in his hometown harmed by Taliban militants if he failed to comply. \n \n The law strikes \n \n Everyone involved in the barbaric murders tried to keep it a secret. Fortunately, though, news of the killings soon reached the authorities. \n \n Law enforcers have been conducting raids and the case has been transferred to the Shah Latif police. SHO Aman Marwat told The News that four people, including Afzal and Hikmat, had been arrested so far while efforts were afoot to track down the main instigator, Sartaj Khan alias Shagalai. The officer said the victims\u2019 bodies would be exhumed on September 13 for autopsies. \n \n Activists working on gender issues and women\u2019s rights say the practice of killing people over misconstrued notions of honour remains rampant in the country, particularly among Pashtun tribesmen. \n \n \u201cSuch incidents keep occurring in Karachi\u2019s Pashtun-populated localities but due to geographical inaccessibility and an absence of a vibrant civil society in the neighbourhoods, news of these murders often does not make it to the media,\u201d said Mahnaz Rahman, resident director of women\u2019s rights body, Aurat Foundation. ||||| Image copyright AFP Image caption Rights groups say honour killings are on the rise in Pakistan \n \n The bodies of a teenage Pakistani couple feared murdered in an \"honour killing\" bear marks suggesting they were electrocuted, police say. \n \n Officials exhumed the bodies of Bakht Jan, 15, and her boyfriend Rehman, 17, a month after they were buried. \n \n Doctors, police and a magistrate were present at the graveside in Karachi. Post-mortem results are awaited. \n \n Police say the couple were planning to elope but their families found out and tribal elders ordered them killed. \n \n Death by electrocution is almost unheard of in so-called honour killings in Pakistan, says the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad. The BBC reported a suspected case in the Indian capital Delhi in 2010. \n \n Four people, including the fathers of the dead Karachi couple, have been arrested. Police are trying to trace the whereabouts of the head of the tribal council (or jirga). \n \n District police head Rao Anwaar told the media that police had been alerted to the killings and burials by an \"informer\". \n \n He said the bodies exhumed at Mauladad graveyard in Sherpao Colony on Wednesday had marks on the arms, chest and legs that indicated electrocution. \n \n \"There were visible signs of electric shock and torture on both bodies,\" Civil Hospital Karachi Additional Police Surgeon Dr Qarar Ahmed Abbasi confirmed, Dawn newspaper reports. \n \n Human rights groups say so-called honour killings are on the rise in Pakistan.

    "input": "Major internet providers, including AT&T, Time Warner and Verizon, are slowing data from popular websites to thousands of US businesses and residential customers in dozens of cities across the country, according to a study released on Monday. \n \n \n \n The study, conducted by internet activists BattlefortheNet, looked at the results from 300,000 internet users and found significant degradations on the networks of the five largest internet service providers (ISPs), representing 75% of all wireline households across the US. \n \n The findings come weeks after the Federal Communications Commission introduced new rules meant to protect \u201cnet neutrality\u201d \u2013 the principle that all data is equal online \u2013 and keep ISPs from holding traffic speeds for ransom. \n \n Tim Karr of Free Press, one of the groups that makes up BattlefortheNet, said the finding show ISPs are not providing content to users at the speeds they\u2019re paying for. \n \n \u201cFor too long, internet access providers and their lobbyists have characterized net neutrality protections as a solution in search of a problem,\u201d said Karr. \u201cData compiled using the Internet Health Test show us otherwise \u2013 that there is widespread and systemic abuse across the network. The irony is that this trove of evidence is becoming public just as many in Congress are trying to strip away the open internet protections that would prevent such bad behavior.\u201d \n \n The study, supported by the technologists at Open Technology Institute\u2019s M-Lab, examines the comparative speeds of Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), which shoulder some of the data load for popular websites. Any site that becomes popular enough has to pay a CDN to carry its content on a network of servers around the country (or the world) so that the material is close to the people who want to access it. \n \n In Atlanta, for example, Comcast provided hourly median download speeds over a CDN called GTT of 21.4 megabits per second at 7pm throughout the month of May. AT&T provided speeds over the same network of \u2155 of a megabit per second. When a network sends more than twice the traffic it receives, that network is required by AT&T to pay for the privilege. When quizzed about slow speeds on GTT, AT&T told Ars Technica earlier this year that it wouldn\u2019t upgrade capacity to a CDN that saw that much outgoing traffic until it saw some money from that network (as distinct from the money it sees from consumers). \n \n AT&T has strongly opposed regulation of its agreements with the companies that directly provide connectivity between high-traffic internet users and their customers. Cogent, Level3 and others have petitioned the FCC to make free interconnection to CDNs a part of the conditions for the proposed merger between AT&T and DirecTV. \n \n \u201cIt would be unprecedented and unjustified to force AT&T to provide free backbone services to other backbone carriers and edge providers, as Cogent et al seek,\u201d said the company in a filing replying to the CDNs\u2019 suggestion, part of a brief opposing the merger. \u201cNor is there any basis for requiring AT&T to augment network capacity for free and without any limits. Opponents\u2019 proposals would shift the costs of their services onto all AT&T subscribers, many of whom do not use Opponents\u2019 services, and would harm consumers.\u201d \n \n FCC chairman Tom Wheeler has taken an aggressive regulatory tack when it comes to mergers in the telecommunications sector. \u201cHistory proves that absent competition a predominant position in the market such as yours creates economic incentives to use that market power to protect your traditional business in a way that is ultimately harmful to consumers,\u201d he told industry leaders at the Internet and Television Expo last month. \n \n The dispute over traffic speeds comes as the telecoms and cable industry readies legal challenges to the net neutrality rules. Most telecoms are content letting their lobbyists, notably trade associations Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (CTIA) and USTelecom, sue the FCC over net neutrality rules, but AT&T has been one of the few companies to sue the FCC directly. ||||| WASHINGTON (CBS DC) \u2014 A new study claims massive Internet providers such as AT&T, Time Warner and Verizon are purposefully slowing data from popular websites to thousands of businesses and residential users across the country. \n \n A study from Internet activists, BattlefortheNet, analyzed data from 300,000 Internet users and found the five largest Internet service providers (ISPs) have significantly degraded data speed, The Guardian reports. The purposeful internet service slow-down from the country\u2019s largest internet provider companies affects 75 percent of all wireline households throughout the U.S. \n \n The BattlefortheNet findings comes just weeks after the Federal Communications Commission introduced new rules meant to protect \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d or the concept that all data on the Internet is equal. The rules are intended to keep ISPs such as AT&T, Time Warner, Verizon and Comcast from holding consumers\u2019 traffic speeds for ransom. The country\u2019s largest ISP companies urged the FCC to ignore consumer outcry and not view their networks as public utilities. \n \n Last September, BattlefortheNet succeeded in overwhelming the federal government with millions of public comments demanding the FCC scrap its proposed rules for net neutrality and write new ones. Their day-long battle managed to send 1,000 calls per minute to members of Congress. \n \n AT&T has continued to fight regulations of its services, calling them \u201cunprecedented\u201d and \u201cunjustified\u201d rules hurting their business. \n \n Tim Karr of Free Press, one of many groups composing BattlefortheNet, said the study reflects that ISPs are continuing to refuse content to users at the speed for which they are paying. \n \n \u201cFor too long, internet access providers and their lobbyists have characterized net neutrality protections as a solution in search of a problem,\u201d Karr told The Guardian. \u201cData compiled using the Internet Health Test show us otherwise \u2013 that there is widespread and systemic abuse across the network.

Although the enforcement action targets AT&T\u2019s cellular business, other broadband providers fear it is a preview of the greater scrutiny the industry will face under a more assertive FCC. \n \n AT&T\u2019s practice affected millions of customers who saw their Internet service slow to the equivalent of dial-up speeds for up to 12 days a month, the FCC said. Thousands of AT&T customers complained as they struggled to browse the Web or watch movies on their smartphones, according to the agency. \n \n The fine is the largest ever levied by the FCC and faults AT&T for failing to adequately disclose that unlimited customers faced \u201cthrottling\u201d of their Internet speeds if the company determined they were using too much data. \n \n \u201cConsumers deserve to get what they pay for,\u201d Wheeler said in a statement. \u201cBroadband providers must be upfront and transparent about the services they provide. The FCC will not stand idly by while consumers are deceived by misleading marketing materials and insufficient disclosure.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n AT&T said it would fight the fine. \u201cWe have been fully transparent with our customers, providing notice in multiple ways and going well beyond the FCC\u2019s disclosure requirements,\u201d the company said in a statement. \n \n But the FCC said that AT&T\u2019s disclosures did not go far enough and that the company should correct its misleading statements. \n \n If AT&T is unsuccessful in challenging the fine, the money will go to the U.S. treasury, not to customers. AT&T should allow customers to drop their unlimited data plans without incurring a penalty, the FCC said. \n \n AT&T stopped offering unlimited data plans to new customers in 2010, but those who already had such plans were allowed to keep them. The company declined to say how many customers have unlimited plans. \n \n Unlimited contracts were once common among cellular providers but fell out of favor as consumer appetite grew for smartphones and mobile Internet. The amount of mobile data used last year jumped 26 percent, according to CTIA, the wireless industry\u2019s top trade group. \n \n The explosion of demand for data has made offering unlimited service too expensive, industry analysts have said. The only way to keep up, they say, is to \u201cthrottle,\u201d or cap, Internet access for customers who use too much data playing games or watching videos. \n \n Most cellular customers now have a limited amount of monthly data and are hit with extra fees when they exceed the cap. \n \n Before implementing its \u201cthrottling\u201d policy in 2011, AT&T allegedly tested the idea with several focus groups. The more participants learned about the program, however, the less they liked it, according to the FCC. Consumers told the company that the policy was inconsistent with its promise of truly \u201cunlimited\u201d data. Yet AT&T went ahead with the policy. \n \n This isn\u2019t the first time AT&T\u2019s unlimited-data policy has landed the company in hot water. The Federal Trade Commission sued the telecom company in October, alleging that 3.5 million users had their Internet service slowed to dial-up speeds. The case is pending, and AT&T has said it would fight the charges. \n \n The FCC fine comes at an awkward time for AT&T as it tries to persuade the FCC to approve its $49 billion acquisition of DirecTV. The deal, which has been under scrutiny for more than a year, is considered essential to AT&T\u2019s growth plans, including giving it access to valuable TV programming. \n \n Consumer advocates said that while Wednesday\u2019s decision is unlikely to jeopardize the deal, it reverses a long-standing perception that the FCC had gotten too cozy with industry. \n \n \u201cBig fines say, \u2018Those days are over, and we expect you to behave,\u2019 \u201d said Harold Feld, senior vice president of the advocacy group Public Knowledge. \u201cAs broadband is recognized increasingly as the critical service for people . . . we\u2019re seeing the consumer-protection agencies within the government taking it a lot more seriously.\u201d \n \n The FCC fined AT&T under a transparency rule that was enacted in 2010 as part of its \u201cnet neutrality\u201d authority \u2014 a set of powers aimed at preventing Internet providers from interfering with how content is delivered to consumers. A federal court struck down those regulations last year, except for the transparency provision, which requires broadband companies to explain their practices clearly to consumers. This year, the FCC passed a new version of net neutrality that is designed to police Internet providers even more closely. \n \n The FCC\u2019s aggressive oversight of AT&T will probably spread to other companies, industry officials fear. T-Mobile, for example, also slows Internet speeds for some of its unlimited customers in certain cases. The company, the country\u2019s fourth-largest cellular provider, declined to comment. Meanwhile, the agency is expected to consider a complaint against Time Warner Cable alleging that the nation\u2019s second-largest cable provider is unfairly charging content providers to access its subscribers. \n \n Industry groups and officials declined to comment publicly on the AT&T fine but said privately that they were worried. \n \n \u201cThis signals a very strong intention of the FCC and its enforcement bureau to make examples of [Internet providers] where they think there\u2019s a problem,\u201d said a cable industry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to comment freely. \u201cIt\u2019s a signal to say, \u2018Watch out, because we\u2019re coming.\u2019 \u201d \n \n Ensuring that consumers have adequate access to the Internet has become a cornerstone of Wheeler\u2019s tenure. In February, the FCC knocked down state limits on city-run Internet services in Tennessee and North Carolina, putting more pressure on large Internet providers. The agency has also increased funding for schools and libraries that need help buying high-speed Internet. \n \n On Thursday, the FCC is expected to expand Lifeline, a Reagan-era program that once subsidized only basic telephone service but under Wheeler could also cover the cost of stand-alone high-speed Internet subscriptions for the first time. \n \n andrea.peterson@washpost.com",

    "input": "As technical failures bedevil the rollout of President Obama\u2019s health care law, evidence is emerging that one of the program\u2019s loftiest goals \u2014 to encourage competition among insurers in an effort to keep costs low \u2014 is falling short for many rural Americans. \n \n While competition is intense in many populous regions, rural areas and small towns have far fewer carriers offering plans in the law\u2019s online exchanges. Those places, many of them poor, are being asked to choose from some of the highest-priced plans in the 34 states where the federal government is running the health insurance marketplaces, a review by The New York Times has found. \n \n Of the roughly 2,500 counties served by the federal exchanges, more than half, or 58 percent, have plans offered by just one or two insurance carriers, according to an analysis by The Times of county-level data provided by the Department of Health and Human Services. In about 530 counties, only a single insurer is participating. \n \n The analysis suggests that the ambitions of the Affordable Care Act to increase competition have unfolded unevenly, at least in the early going, and have not addressed many of the factors that contribute to high prices. Insurance companies are reluctant to enter challenging new markets, experts say, because medical costs are high, dominant insurers are difficult to unseat, and powerful hospital systems resist efforts to lower rates. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the structure of the Affordable Care Act which really deals with that problem,\u201d said John Holahan, a fellow at the Urban Institute, who noted that many factors determine costs in a given market. \u201cI think that all else being equal, premiums will clearly be higher when there\u2019s not that competition.\u201d \n \n The Obama administration has said 95 percent of Americans live in areas where there are at least two insurers in the exchanges. But many experts say two might not be enough to create competition that would help lower prices. \n \n For example, in Wyoming, two insurers are offering plans at prices that are higher than in neighboring Montana, where a third carrier is seen as a factor in keeping prices lower. \n \n It is unclear how the online marketplaces might evolve over time. Many large insurers are closely watching what happens in the first year to decide whether to more aggressively pursue new markets. In the meantime, problems with the healthcare.gov Web site are making it harder for them to know whether the exchanges\u2019 slow start is the result of technical difficulties or more serious underlying problems, such as a lack of consumer demand, that would discourage them from entering. \n \n In some cases, competition varies markedly across county lines. In Monroe County, Fla., which includes the Florida Keys, two insurers, Cigna and Florida Blue, offer plans on the federal exchanges. In neighboring Miami-Dade County, there are seven companies, including Aetna and Humana, two of the nation\u2019s largest players. \n \n In rural Baker County, Ga., where there is only one insurer, a 50-year-old shopping for a silver plan would pay at least $644.05 before federal subsidies. (Plans range in price and levels of coverage from bronze to platinum, with silver a middle option.) A 50-year-old in Atlanta, where there are four carriers, could pay $320.06 for a comparable plan. Federal subsidies could significantly reduce monthly premiums for people with low incomes. \n \n Counties with one carrier are mostly concentrated in the South. Nearly all of the counties in Mississippi and Alabama, for example, are served by just one insurer, according to The Times\u2019s analysis. Other states with scarce competition include Maine, West Virginia, North Carolina and Alaska. \n \n \u201cThe consumer wants some level of choice,\u201d said Alexander K. Feldvebel, the deputy insurance commissioner for New Hampshire, where one carrier, Anthem Blue Cross, owned by WellPoint, now offers plans. \u201cYou don\u2019t have that when you have a single carrier offering all the products.\u201d ||||| WASHINGTON\u2014No one in the government made sure the many complex parts of the federal health-insurance website worked together properly, and testing of the complete site didn't take place until two weeks before its Oct. 1 launch, contractors said at the first congressional hearings into the matter. \n \n \"It seems like we've got several fingers but no palm here,\" said Rep. Michael Burgess (R., Texas), as contractors for the site...",
    "reference": "\u2013 ObamaCare's technical difficulties are well-documented\u2014the House is dragging four contractors in to talk about them today\u2014but it has one problem no web developer can solve: It's pretty lousy in rural areas. The theory behind the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplace is that forcing insurers to compete will keep prices low. But in many rural areas, that competition simply isn't materializing, the New York Times reports. In 21% of the 2,500 counties serviced by the federal exchanges, consumers have only one carrier to choose from. Among the reasons why new insurers aren't stepping in: \"dominant\" insurers hold tightly to their territory, and \"powerful\" hospital systems fiercely oppose any moves that would trim their rates. Most under-served areas are poor, and many are in the South; there's only one option in almost all of Mississippi and Alabama. That lack of competition can have a huge effect on prices. A 50-year-old in rural Georgia, for instance, would pay twice as much for a silver-level plan as one in Atlanta. The cheapest silver plan in Wyoming, which has two insurers, costs as much as the most expensive in Montana, which has three (including one new co-op). \"The Affordable Care Act was designed for \u2026 big cities,\" Wyoming's insurance commissioner says. \"You've got to have some bargaining chips, and we don't have that much.\""

I know this is late and I would like to apologize to everyone that I haven't been able to reach out to all of you before it was released to facebook. On Wednesday, November 15, 2017, the love of my life, my best friend, my closest confidant, Robert Buchel passed away suddenly. I wish I could say that my heart was broken or even shattered, but in reality it is just gone. My heart died along with him. Our future together died along with him. Next year we were going to be getting married in Walt Disney World and have our own Disney Fairytale Wedding. We were going to start a family. We were going to grow old together. Everything we were ever going to be can now never be. He did not deserve to go this way and this was not his time. 14 years together is not enough and although many people say it's better to love the time you have than to mourn the time you don't: no offense but screw you. Rob had a hard life and in the last 2 months he finally had hope for the life he always wanted. This was a robbery beyond words. And thanks to those of you who have reached out to me, I realize now that this robbery is more dispicable than I thought. The memories and the love that I have been seeing for him has been overwhelming. I am overjoyed at how much love he had given but also received from all of you. I am also angered beyond words that he's not here to continue to love and be loved. And even moreseo I am saddened that he died not realizing how much love you all really had for him. Rob suffered from never realizing how good a man he was and always felt inadequate and a failure. Thank you to all of you for validating my love for him. I knew what kind of soul he had but could never convince him of how truly special he was. A person like him should never have to die this way and certainly not this young and most definitely not when his life was about to begin. Arrangements have not been made yet, but his mother and I will be settling things here in Texas as we wait for his remains. Once we have him back, we will bring him home and I promise you that I will notify you when his memorial is scheduled. You all meant so much to him and I thank you all for being there. Please keep his mom and family and friends in your thoughts. This has been difficult for all of us. But most of all, please do this for me: take lessons from him. Every morning he would tell me or text me \"good morning angel\". Every phone call ended with \"I love you.\" Every night he would text me or tell me \"Goodnight my love.\" In fact the night before he passed he told me \"If I don't wake up tomorrow please know that I have always loved you.\" Tell that person you love that you love them. The only consolation I have right now is that we were together and that his last words of peace to me were how he felt about me and how I felt about him. And when he did pass, he was not alone. I was there holding his hand. Thank you to the doctors and nurses who worked tirelessly for almost three hours to bring him back to me. Although I do not know your names, please understand your efforts will not be forgotten. I still have his phone on and his facebook is still live. I will see your messages to him and I will try to respond, You can also contact me directly as well. Thank you all for loving him.",

Seski, M.D. & Associates, P.C., an oncology practice based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, pleaded guilty to a criminal charge of having caused the introduction of an unapproved drug into interstate commerce and was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. Magistrate Judge Karen S. Crawford also ordered the defendant to place ads in two medical journals, warning of the dangers of unapproved drugs. \n \n In pleading guilty earlier today before Judge Crawford, the medical practice admitted that between December 4, 2008 and May 25, 2011, the practice ordered $973,795 worth of foreign versions of the oncology drugs Eloxatin7, Gemzar7, and Taxotere7 from GlobalRxStore.com and had them shipped through Oberlin Medical Supply of San Diego. The drugs ordered by the practice were determined to be foreign versions of these drugs and were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States. \n \n According to sentencing documents filed with the court, this case came to light in May 2011, when federal agents visited Oberlin Medical Supply's offices in San Diego. Maher Idriss, (charged in Criminal Case No. 12cr1775-WQH) the owner of Oberlin Medical Supply, had been working in conjunction with Martin Bean (charged in Criminal Case No. 12cr3734-WQH) and others of GlobalRxStore.com (GlobalRx) to supply foreign oncology drugs to doctors throughout the United States. At Oberlin, the agents discovered numerous boxes of oncology drugs that bore labeling indicating that the products had been manufactured outside of the United States and were not approved for use in this country. \n \n The medical practice provided agents with a copy of a label for boxes of Gemzar received from GlobalRx. The labeling indicated that the product was manufactured by Eli Lilly in Fegershaim, France. The labeling was partially in English and partially in Turkish. The labels did not bear the words \"Rx only\" as required by the FDA and did not bear the National Drug Code (NDC) numbers used for Medicare billing in this country. Moreover, the labels were different in color from the FDA-approved labeling for the U.S. product. \n \n The medical practice later provided to the government one of the vials of drugs that was in the box. When tested, the vial was found to have the active ingredient used in the manufacture of Gemzar. However, without such testing there is no assurance that other foreign drugs purchased by the defendant (outside of the closed chain system established by the FDA to protect patients in this country) all contain the active ingredient. Just recently, in February, 2013, the FDA warned doctors about batches of counterfeit Avastin (an oncology drug) that had been sold to U.S. doctors that did not contain any of the active ingredients, the third such incident in several months. \n \n Defendant in Criminal Case No. 13cr3316-KSC \n \n Jan C.

(Associated Press) \n \n Zimbabwe's National Parks and Wildlife Management Authority accused Jan Casimir Seski of Murrysville, Pennsylvania, of shooting the lion with a bow and arrow in April near Hwange National Park, without approval, on land where it was not allowed. \n \n Landowner Headman Sibanda was arrested and is assisting police, it said. \n \n Seski is a gynecological oncologist who directs the Center for Bloodless Medicine and Surgery at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. \n \n He's also an active big-game hunter, according to safari outfitters and bow-hunting sites where kill shots identify \"Dr. Jan Seski\" as the man standing next to slain animals including elephants, a hippo, an ostrich and antelopes such as an impala, a kudu, and a nyala. \n \n The Associated Press called and knocked on the door at Seski's home, which is set back among some woods outside Pittsburgh. The AP also left a message with an answering service for his medical practice, with no immediate response. \n \n One image on the Melorani Safaris Facebook page, since taken down, showed Seski posing with the body of a small antelope in 2012, with a caption saying it was killed two days after he shot it with an arrow. Other captions described how his arrows penetrated organs and split bones. \n \n \"This Zimbabwe elephant is the sixth African elephant shot by Dr. Jan Seski,\" Alaska Bowhunting Supply claims in a caption dated September 2014, below a picture of the doctor posing above the dead beast's trunk and tusks. \n \n \"The arrow was shot quartering into the elephant, penetrated a rib and one lung, lacerated the heart and liver, and was recovered in the gut. The elephant went a short distance and died. With results like this, no wonder Jan is a firm supporter of our Ultra-Magnum Arrow System.\" \n \n Alaska Bowhunting Supply didn't immediately respond Sunday to a request for comment, and it wasn't clear how the hunting supply company learned such details about the hunt. \n \n Images of the doctor wearing camouflage and holding high-powered bows match those on Seski's website, where he wears a suit or hospital scrubs. His address and other identifying information given by authorities in Zimbabwe matches those of U.S. medical authorities. \n \n A handful of Seski's neighbors said he mostly keeps to himself and that he'd been buying up the land around his property. Ernest Hahn said Seski put up no-trespassing signs, breaking the rural area's tradition of people feeling free to cross property lines to hunt. \n \n Hahn said Seski can be \"quirky,\" walking around wearing a low-slung pistol \"like a gunslinger,\" for example, but he appreciates that his neighbor is protecting land from development. \n \n \"It seemed to me everything he does is aboveboard,\" Hahn said. \"I've never seen him done anything illegal or unsportsmanlike at all.\" \n \n Seski provided his name and other identifying information for a government database when he came for the hunt, Zimbabwe National Parks spokeswoman Caroline Washaya Moyo said. \n \n \"When hunters come into the country they fill a document stating their personal details, the amount they have paid for the hunt, the number of animals to be hunted, the species to be hunted and the area and period where that hunt is supposed to take place,\" she said. \"The American conducted his hunt in an area where lion hunting is outlawed. The landowner who helped him with the hunt also did not have a have a quota for lion hunting.\" \n \n Seski seemed like a \"perfect gentleman\" to Stewart Dorrington, who operates Melorani Safaris and owns a game reserve in neighboring South Africa where Seski hunted in 2012. \n \n \"He was a great guy,\" Dorrington said. \"Everything he did was perfectly legal and aboveboard and a great help to our conservation efforts.\" \n \n Dorrington said he converted his cattle ranch into a game reserve in the 1980s. He said funds from trophy hunting of antelope are essential to conserving wildlife. \n \n Dorrington said he received an abusive phone call Sunday; his Facebook page was later closed from view after people began posting threatening comments. \n \n Two other illegal lion hunts also were recorded last year in Zimbabwe, said Geoffrey Matipano, conservation director for the wildlife authority. He did not provide details on those cases. \n \n Zimbabwean authorities have said they will seek the extradition of Minnesota dentist Walter James Palmer, alleging he lacked authorization to kill \"Cecil.\" The lion was lured out of Hwange park, wounded with a bow and arrow and then tracked down and shot, conservationists said. \n \n Palmer said he relied on professional guides to ensure his hunt was legal. Two Zimbabwean citizens were arrested and face charges. \n \n Zimbabwe's wildlife authority has suspended the hunting of lions, leopards and elephants in the Hwange area, and said Saturday that bow and arrow hunts can be approved by only by the head of the wildlife authority. \n \n In Washington, meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., announced the \"Conserving Ecosystems by Ceasing the Importation of Large (CECIL) Animal Trophies Act,\" which would expand import bans to species proposed for listing as threatened or endangered, as well as those already listed as endangered. \n \n \"The logic is that if you keep killing them, they will become endangered,\" Menendez spokesman Steven Sandberg said Sunday. \n \n ___ \n \n Contributors include Christopher Torchia in Johannesburg; Kristen De Groot and Ron Todt in Philadelphia and Zach Brendza in Murrysville, Pennsylvania; and Deepti Hajela in New York City. ||||| Jan C.

Officials there say in a press release that Jan Casmir Sieski of Murrysville, Pa., joined a hunt in April near Hwange National Park, where an American dentist recently coaxed out and killed a famous lion. The New York Times finds no Jan Casmir Sieski on record, but spotted a Jan Casimir Seski running a gynecological oncologist practice in Pittsburgh. The AP knocked on his door in a wooded area near Pittsburgh, and called his practice, but hasn't heard back. Meanwhile, pictures on social media (now removed) show the 68-year-old posing with wildlife he apparently killed in Africa, including antelope and elephants. The AP says he's specifically accused of illegal lion-hunting. Seski's neighbors describe him as mostly a loner. One says he's \"quirky\" and carries a low-slung handgun \"like a gunslinger,\" but adds that \"I've never seen him done anything illegal or unsportsmanlike at all.\" Turns out Seski pleaded guilty to allowing $973,795 in unapproved, foreign oncology drugs into the US between 2008 and 2011, the Daily News reports. According to an official document, he was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. He's also seen as a trailblazer in bloodless surgery. Now Zimbabwe officials have arrested the farm owner who allegedly conducted the April hunt, and stopped all hunting of elephants, leopards, and lions outside Hwange National Park."

PlayStation said it was getting to grips with the issue and thanked users for their patience. \n \n A hacking group called Lizard Squad claimed to have caused the problems. \n \n The name is the same used by a group of hackers that has targeted Sony in the past. \n \n Microsoft's Xbox Live has 48 million subscribers and Sony's PlayStation system has more than double that number, at about 110 million users. \n \n In a tweet posted on Saturday morning, PlayStation said: \"Update: PS4, PS3, and Vita network services are gradually coming back online - thanks for your patience.\" \n \n A later statement said: \"We are seeing reduced reports of network issues. We'll continue to monitor.\" \n \n 'Member Two' \n \n A hacker claiming to be from Lizard Squad - a 22-year-old calling himself Member Two - said it had hacked the sites \"because we can\". \n \n He also suggested the motive was to demonstrate weaknesses in the two companies systems. \n \n \"It's just such a huge company Microsoft... Do you not think they should be able to prevent such an attack?\" he told BBC Radio 5live. \n \n \"Is Christmas really about children playing with their new consoles, or playing with their new toys, or is it about them spending time with their families and celebrating Christmas?\" he added. \n \n \"I think everyone's just taking it all out of the ordinary.\" \n \n Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent \n \n Image copyright AFP \n \n Sony executives must be asking themselves - when will it stop? \n \n The attack on the PlayStation network - along with Microsoft's Xbox Live network - is nothing like as serious and sophisticated as the Sony Pictures hack. \n \n But the impact on customers is more direct, and the fact that the company has taken longer than Microsoft to get its network up and running is another blow to the reputation of its security operation. \n \n The distributed denial of service attack which overwhelmed the servers at Sony and Microsoft appears to have been on a very large scale, and came when traffic would have already been very high. \n \n But customers are just as angry with Lizard Squad, the group which claims it launched the attack - and has since justified it with some rather pompous statements about exposing poor security. \n \n The group now appears to have set its sights on bringing down Tor, the secure network which enables anonymous online communication. That has incurred the wrath of the better known hacker collective Anonymous - so prepare for more online conflict in the coming days. \n \n Services disconnected \n \n To make the most of the Xbox and PlayStation consoles players have to connect to the internet in order to reach the console manufacturers' servers. \n \n The outage stopped people accessing some core services, such as registering a new account, connecting with other people to play the same game and connecting to entertainment channels via the console. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption A hacking group called Lizard Squad claimed to have caused the problem \n \n Earlier this month a different branch of Sony - Sony Pictures Entertainment - was hit by a cyber attack that stole huge amounts of data from its servers. \n \n The fallout from that hack soon focussed on The Interview, a film featuring a fictional plot to assassinate North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un. \n \n No link between Sony Pictures hack and the gaming service disruptions has been confirmed. \n \n However, the latest disruption did mean that many families were unable to enjoy their new Christmas presents. \n \n In the UK, Ros Bruce, from Essex, said her 10-year-old son got an Xbox One for Christmas, had spent most of the day in tears, and called for Xbox to provide compensation. \n \n Ian Hornby, from Lancashire, spent a frustrating time trying to connect a new PlayStation to the Sony network, and said he hoped that the electronics giant would now invest in better protection for its systems. ||||| Gamers who received new consoles for Christmas might find themselves unable to connect and play with friends, thanks to a coordinated attack by hackers who claim to have taken down the two largest gaming networks. On what might be the biggest gaming day of the year, a hacker group called Lizard Squad is claiming responsibility for taking down both Xbox Live and PlayStation Network. \n \n Reports of service disruptions began popping up earlier today, with both Xbox Live and PlayStation Network acknowledging issues with some core services. In both cases, users have had a difficult time logging in to the networks, which generally gives them access to connect with friends and play games requiring online access. \n \n We are aware that there have been issues reported with PSN. Thanks for your patience as we investigate. \u2014 Ask PlayStation (@AskPlayStation) December 24, 2014 \n \n A hacker group called Lizard Squad claims to be behind the attacks, which follow weeks of threatening to take the systems offline. This is the same group that said it was behind PlayStation Network and Blizzard outages in August that took down games like League of Legends and Path of Exile. \n \n https://twitter.com/FUCKCRUCIFIX/status/548168352666247168 \n \n For those who just got a shiny new PS4 or XBOne for Christmas, the attack couldn\u2019t have come at a worse time. That\u2019s because new users generally have to be connected to one of those networks even just to set up their Xbox or PlayStation accounts for the first time. \n \n And what are those gamers supposed to do for the rest of the day? Spend time with their families? ||||| Sony\u2019s online PlayStation store and Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Live network have been disrupted over Christmas in what is thought to have been a cyber-attack on the companies. \n \n \n \n The network outages, which have left millions of users unable to play games and access entertainment channels, are continuing into a second day. \n \n Sony said on Friday that some users were having trouble logging into its network and engineers were investigating. Microsoft said it knew some users were having trouble signing in. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of this issue and we\u2019re working to find a fix ASAP.\u201d \n \n An online entity calling itself Lizard Squad, regarded as a serial nuisance by gamers the world over, appeared to take responsibility for the disruptions via its Twitter account. A DDoS attack, which bombards servers with spurious traffic, was thought to have been the method used. \n \n The PlayStation store also experienced spells of inaccessibility earlier this month. That followed the hacking of computer systems of Sony Pictures Entertainment, followed by the release of confidential information on the internet. \n \n Sony and Microsoft had both expected heavy use over Christmas as people who received their computer games tried to hook up. The problems may have been exacerbated by Sony\u2019s decision to let consumers download controversial movie The Interview through Xbox Video as well as other online sources. \n \n Microsoft said in an online message: \u201cAre you having a rough time signing in to Xbox Live? We\u2019re working to get this figured out right away. We appreciate your patience.\u201d \n \n Sony similarly pleaded for patience. \u201cWe are aware that some users are experiencing difficulty logging into the PSN,\u201d it said. \n \n On Thursday Microsoft Xbox spokesman Sean McCarthy had declined to give details of how the company may have been preparing for security breaches, given the problems that Sony has experienced in releasing The Interview. \n \n \u201cOf course it\u2019s safe to say holiday season is always a very busy time of year for any consumer electronics company, so we work hard to ensure the stability of our infrastructure when so many consoles are activating for the first time.\u201d \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report ||||| Story highlights Some Xbox users finally able to log on to network \n \n Incident and a hack of Sony Pictures don't appear to be related \n \n Lizard Squad hacker group has claimed responsibility for prior attacks \n \n One Twitter user bemoans issue, stuck with cranky teenager \n \n (CNN) Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox Live gaming networks experienced widespread problems on Christmas Day as a hacker group claimed responsibility for what it said was an attack. \n \n Hundreds of users took to Twitter to report problems with the systems, which lasted much of the day. \n \n \"With the #Xbox hacking shutdown going on I'm watching my 15 year old nephew meltdown: 'I've got nothing else to do!!!!'\" Jim Crilley Jr. wrote on the social messaging site. \n \n The problem persisted for hours, but Thursday night Xbox Live briefly posted a message on its support website saying: \"Were you having a hard time signing in to Xbox Live? If so, we're glad to say we've reached a solution! You can once again sign in without any issues. Thanks for hanging in there while we worked. We appreciate it!\" \n \n But many PlayStation users were still having difficulty logging on to their network. \n \n Gamers were able to play games offline, but couldn't communicate with other players or make use of network functions. \n \n The hacker group Lizard Squad said earlier it was \"smacking\" the two systems, apparently one of several attacks in December. The group took responsibility for keeping each network down earlier this month on separate occasions. \n \n On Thursday, the group asked for retweets in exchange for ending the problem, which could be a distributed denial of service attack. \n \n That's when hackers flood networks with illegitimate traffic, overwhelming the ability of the servers. \n \n The problem might be exacerbated by video gamers who received new systems for Christmas and were adding to the potential traffic on one of the busiest gaming days of the year. \n \n The network downtime started just hours after Microsoft's Xbox video store started to stream the Seth Rogen comedy \"The Interview.\" The movie was made by Sony Pictures, a sibling of Sony's PlayStation division. \n \n Sony was the victim of a massive cyberattack in late November that was widely believed to be motivated, at least in part, by North Korea's anger over \"The Interview,\" which depicts the assassination of Kim Jong Un. \n \n But there was no indication that Thursday's problems were in any way connected to the movie's digital release. Other participating distributors of the movie, such as YouTube, were unaffected. And PlayStation is not participating in the release. \n \n A Sony Pictures spokesman deferred to PlayStation for comment about the outage.",

The problems began Christmas Eve and persisted through the next day, with Microsoft and Sony telling users they were aware of the issues and were doing their best to get them fixed, the BBC reports. Some suspected the problems may have been linked to Sony's release of The Interview, but a hacking group calling itself the Lizard Squad has claimed responsibility, reports TechCrunch. The same group said it took down gaming networks in August following tweets denouncing the bombing of ISIS targets. The group, which also took responsibility for bringing Xbox and PlayStation networks down earlier this month, asked for retweets of its messages yesterday in return for ending the problem, CNN reports.

REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein - RTSAF6Q \n \n Schlafly, who lived in the St. Louis suburb of Ladue, Missouri, died at her home in the presence of her family, Eagle Forum said in a statement. The cause of death was not given. \n \n She was still a conservative force and popular speaker in her 90s, endorsing Donald Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 and praising his policy on immigration. She was a delegate to the Republicans\u2019 convention in Cleveland. \n \n Trump said in a statement that he spoke with Schlafly a few weeks ago by telephone \u201cand she sounded as resilient as ever ... She was a patriot, a champion for women, and a symbol of strength.\u201d \n \n Schlafly once called feminists \u201ca bunch of bitter women seeking a constitutional cure for their personal problems,\u201d Time said, while insisting that \u201cwomen find their greatest fulfillment at home with their family.\u201d \n \n Her political ardor did not fade with age and in 2014, as President Barack Obama pushed for pay equity for women, Schlafly sparked controversy with a column for the Christian Post saying a man\u2019s paycheck comes first. \n \n \u201cThe pay gap between men and women is not all bad because it helps to promote and sustain marriages,\u201d she said. \u201c... The best way to improve economic prospects for women is to improve job prospects for the men in their lives, even if that means increasing the so-called pay gap.\u201d \n \n Schlafly promoted traditional family values and once told a reporter that she always listed her occupation as \u201cmother\u201d when filling out applications. But she was hardly a typical stay-at-home housewife/mother. \n \n Shortly after marrying lawyer Fred Schlafly in 1949, she became active in Republican Party politics in Alton, Illinois, and ran unsuccessfully for Congress twice. She would go on to found the Eagle Forum grass-roots conservative group, write a newspaper column and newsletter and author some 20 books. \n \n Her crowning achievement was crusading to prevent the Equal Rights Amendment from being added to the U.S. Constitution and it made Schlafly a leader in the modern American conservative movement. \n \n \u201cPhyllis Schlafly courageously and single-handedly took on the issue of the Equal Rights Amendment when no one else in the country was opposing it,\u201d said James C. Dobson, chairman and founder of Focus on the Family. \u201cIn so doing, she essentially launched the pro-family, pro-life movement.\u201d \n \n Biographer Donald T. Critchlow said defeating the ERA helped usher in a conservative era in American politics and boosted Ronald Reagan to the presidency. \n \n In her decade-long fight against the ERA, Schlafly traveled across the country to speak at rallies and persuade state legislators not to approve the ERA. \n \n Along the way she often debated feminist writer Betty Freidan, who called Schlafly \u201ca traitor to her sex\u201d and once told her: \u201cI\u2019d like to burn you at the stake.\u201d \n \n The intention of the ERA was to ensure women were treated the same as men under state and federal laws. Schlafly\u2019s attack on the proposed amendment was based on the premise that the rights of women already were well protected by the U.S. Constitution. She said the ERA actually would erode women\u2019s standing, leading to homosexual marriages, women in combat, government-funded abortions and loss of alimony. \n \n In 1972 she started the Eagle Forum, now located in Clayton, Missouri, along with Stop ERA, bringing in legions of supporters who had been regarded as non-political housewives. In a 1978 appearance at the Illinois capitol she was accompanied by backers bearing loaves of home-made bread. \n \n Described by Time magazine as \u201cfeminine but forceful\u201d and with her hair always carefully styled, Schlafly said she attended 41 state hearings to testify against the Equal Rights Amendment.

She put herself through Washington University by firing weapons as an ammunition factory tester and later earned a master\u2019s degree in political science from Radcliffe. In 1978 she graduated from Washington University\u2019s law school. \n \n The left attacked Schlafly for promoting domestic life to her supporters while spending so much time pursuing her ambitious political agenda. She responded by saying she never told women they should not work. \n \n \u201cI simply didn\u2019t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women\u2019s rights,\u201d Schlafly told the New York Times. \n \n Schlafly first became a political presence with her 1964 self-published book \u201cA Choice, Not an Echo,\u201d which championed the conservative politics of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater. \n \n Schlafly also built a reputation as a strident anti-Communist and opponent of arms control treaties. After the ERA\u2019s defeat, she continued to preach conservative causes such as limited government, anti-abortion laws, traditional education, strong defense and keeping out illegal immigrants. \n \n Related Coverage Factbox: Facts about conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly \n \n She frequently criticized immigration reform and the Obama administration and wrote more than 25 books. \n \n Schlafly also was a critic of gay rights, which proved to be a sensitive topic in 1992 when the oldest of her six children, John, who worked for the Eagle Forum, acknowledged he was homosexual. \n \n Schlafly\u2019s husband Fred died in 1993. She is survived by six children, 16 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, Eagle Forum said.",

She threw a party when it expired in 1982, having been passed by both houses of Congress but only ratified by 35 of the necessary 38 states, reports Reuters. Schlafly\u2014who worked at a munitions factory in World War II\u2014earned a master's degree in political science and a law degree, unsuccessfully ran for Congress three times and founded the Eagle Forum conservative group while raising six children and presenting herself as a traditional housewife, the New York Times reports. When she spoke at gatherings nationwide, Schlafly loved to mock what she called \"women's libbers\" by saying: \"I'd like to thank my husband, Fred, for letting me be here today.\" Historians say the ERA might have passed if it wasn't for Schlafly, who mobilized anti-feminist volunteers across the country and warned that the amendment could lead to gay marriage, women in combat, and unisex restrooms, the Los Angeles Times notes. She remained active in her later years and endorsed Donald Trump in March this year, saying: \"We've been following the losers for so long,\" but \"now we've got a guy who will lead us to victory.\" After her death, Trump issued a statement calling Schlafly \"a patriot, a champion for women, and a symbol of strength.\" (In 2012, she warned men not to date feminists.)"

Wilson, Barbara Broccoli and Daniel Craig today announced that due to creative differences Danny Boyle has decided to no longer direct Bond 25,\" the official James Bond Twitter account tweeted. \n \n Boyle revealed in March that he was eyeing the next Bond film, which he was set to tackle after directing an untitled comedy starring Lily James and Kate McKinnon, which opens in September 2019. The filmmaker is a longtime 007 fan, and included Craig\u2019s Bond in the opening of the 2012 London Olympics, which Boyle directed. Boyle's Trainspotting collaborator John Hodge was writing a script for the next Bond pic based on an idea from the helmer. A previous draft was written by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, who penned Craig's Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall and Spectre. \n \n The director shake-up comes as developments in the Bond franchise continue to capture the public's attention. The next Bond is expected to be Craig's last as the secret agent, and speculation about who could replace him after Bond 25 sets the internet ablaze on a semi-regular basis. Upon being tapped as director, Boyle was seen by some as a natural choice, due to his Oscar pedigree as the filmmaker behind Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours. But it was also viewed as a surprise, given that the filmmaker, who had avoided franchises in the past, would board the Bond machine after crafting idiosyncratic genre films such as 28 Days Later and Sunshine. \n \n Production on the next James Bond film is currently set to begin in December for a U.S. release date of Nov. 8, 2019. It is scheduled to hit the U.K. on Oct. 25, 2019. Universal is distributing the film internationally, while MGM, which is making the movie with Eon Productions, is handling domestic rights. \n \n Sam Mendes directed the previous two installments of the James Bond series, with 2012's Skyfall earning a franchise best $1.1 billion and 2015's Spectre bringing in $880 million.",

While the company\u2019s reputation for instant printing is less prevalent these days, the resurgence of analogue photography \u2013 or perhaps more specifically, the analogue aesthetic \u2013 has brought them back into relevance. \n \n They also hit the headlines back in May last year when a subsidiary of Acacia Research Corporation, a renowned patent troll, acquired patents covering digital imaging and other related technologies that were originally issued to Polaroid. \n \n Image Credit: Polaroid \n \n Read next: Christmas week saw a record-breaking 1.76 billion app downloads worldwide: Flurry ||||| Though its heyday is behind it, Polaroid is still trying to carve a space in the photography sector, and it's hoping brick and mortar storefronts might do the trick.

It's not really all that hard to share, save, edit, or even print photos elsewhere, so physical Fotobars will also be banking on \"Phototenders\" who can guide users through the process and on evoking the \"classic Polaroid experience.\" Polaroid is already playing on the nostalgia value of its brand with updated versions of its instant printing cameras, and Fotobar is one of several online retailers experimenting with offline service, but with online competitors and a fairly niche product, it's a somewhat risky endeavor.",

From Maine to New Jersey, you can't go a day without reading a story about flood damage. They're all sad, but this one, this one today was just plain horrible ... if not horrifying. A Petco store in Johnson City, New York was evacuated then beset by flood waters. When employees returned to the store for the first time on Friday, they found not only wet floors, but 100 dead animals. From hamsters to birds, little pets perished by either drowning or starving -- the cause of death has yet to be confirmed. \n \n The saddest part is that these deaths could have been prevented. \n \n Had the manager or store officials been a little extra-cautious, perhaps they would have evacuated the whole store, not just the employees and a \"majority\" of the pets. The ones who weren't cleared out suffered a cruel and unusual fate. Petco's CEO says that the fact that store was new, and had never been through a flood before, was the reason they misjudged the risk of their location. \n \n If the flooding began on Wednesday, and schools in the area were closing early due to the rising waters, why didn't an employee or Petco manager think to check on the store? Listen, I know what it's like to be sick of the weather hype. As a New Yorker who \"survived\" Irene, I was a little frustrated by the overly-cautious preventions the city took. That said, I'd rather be safe than sorry. Which is why I'm surprised Petco, who's responsible for the lives of hundreds of animals, didn't react sooner. When lives are at stake, you have to over-react and over-prepare. Plan for the worst, hope for the best, enjoy bitching about preparing for the worst when everything turns out for the best -- that's how the saying goes, doesn't it? \n \n Animal lovers are rightfully outraged by the incident -- there's been a Facebook page set up calling for the boycott of Petco, and PETA's now involved. While I'm not necessarily a fan of PETA, I am a fan of keeping animals safe. There must have been a lot of people in town who would have gladly adopted the pets for the flood's duration, or a volunteer or two to make sure they stayed fed in the store (if in fact they didn't drown). \n \n There's no info on whether or not the pet fish in the store were super psyched about the flood, but clearly no one else is happy about it. \n \n Do you think Petco should be boycotted? \n \n \n \n \n \n Photo via fwooper/Flickr \n \n",

(Photo by Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg) \n \n The U.S. economy added 209,000 jobs in July, according to government data released Friday morning, surpassing economists' expectations and suggesting the economy continues to thrive after an extended streak of job gains in recent years. \n \n The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.3 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in June, and wages rose by 2.5 percent from the year before to $26.36 in July. \n \n \u201cIt was pretty solid across the board,\u201d said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JP Morgan. \u201cIt suggests there is really no slowing in the momentum of the labor market.\u201d \n \n [How healthy is Trump\u2019s economy?] \n \n President Trump greeted the report as evidence of his administration's success, tweeting Friday morning, \u201cExcellent Jobs Numbers just released \u2014 and I have only just begun.\u201d \n \n Yet average monthly jobs gains this year, which are now at 184,000, are basically in line with the average monthly gains of 187,000 in 2016. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re looking at job growth that was pretty similar to what we were getting a year ago or two years ago. I just don\u2019t think at a business cycle frequency these things respond to political developments,\u201d Feroli said. \n \n The U.S. labor market has made strong and steady gains in recent months, even as this period of economic expansion has stretched into the third longest in history. That has driven U.S. stock markets to record highs, with the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average closing above 22,000 Wednesday for the first time in history. The Dow opened at 22,058.39 Friday morning, before retreating slightly by mid-day. \n \n July\u2019s additions also signify a notable turning point for the U.S. economy: After accounting for shifts in population, the level of employment has returned to what it was at in November 2007, before the recession decimated the job market, according to research published Friday morning by the Brookings Institution\u2019s Hamilton project. \n \n \u201cIt does not mean there\u2019s no slack in the economy, [or] that we\u2019re at full employment. But it does mean the job losses from the Great Recession are behind us,\u201d said Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, one of the report\u2019s authors. \n \n Job gains were broadly spread across many sectors, with health care, restaurants and office jobs recording the strongest increases. \n \n Low-wage industries like leisure and hospitality grew the fastest in July, a development which may help lower-income Americans get back to work, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at jobs site Indeed. Yet manufacturing hit a new low in July as a share of all U.S. jobs, said Kolko. While manufacturing has been a focus of the Trump administration, the sector continues to shed jobs, due largely to automation. \n \n Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected 180,000 jobs to be added in the month, in line with average monthly gains for the first six months of the year. Government statisticians revised their estimates for May and June, in total adding 2,000 jobs to the rolls. \n \n America's monthly jobs report can be hard to understand. Here's what you need to know about non-farm payroll employment and the unemployment rate\u2014with gummy bears to help explain. (Kate M. Tobey,Gillian Brockell,Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) \n \n The labor force swelled as more Americans found work. The labor force participation rate, the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking work, ticked up to 62.9 percent after dipping in previous months. \n \n The jobs data is gathered from two separate surveys, one of employers and the other of households. It will be revised twice in subsequent months, sometimes significantly. \n \n The economy's strength has encouraged the Federal Reserve to continue to gradually raise interest rates to more normal levels, after years of keeping lending easy to stimulate the economy. \n \n Yet wage growth remains somewhat tepid, a sign that the economy may have farther to go before reaching the point where further expansion merely results in inflationary pressures. As the unemployment rate falls, business owners have to compete more to hire qualified workers, forcing them to raise wages and adding to inflation. \n \n In a call on Thursday to state their support for Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and urge Trump to reappoint her when her term expires early next year, members of a coalition called Fed Up argued that the economy\u2019s recovery is not yet complete and that the Fed should maintain low interest rates to allow workers, especially lower-income communities of color, to recover from the financial crisis. \n \n \u201cWe still don\u2019t look like an economy that should still be raising interest rates, and we absolutely should not be raising interest rates in an autopilot kind of way,\u201d said Josh Bivens, director of research at the Economic Policy Institute. \n \n Futures contracts indicate most investors expect the central bank to hold interest rates steady when it meets in September, instead focusing on a plan to reduce its massive balance sheet. But those contracts put the odds of a rate hike in December at over 40 percent. \n \n Investors should bet on more rate hikes this year, Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG, said in an email to clients Thursday. \u201cInflation is coming and the Fed has to push interest rates back to normal levels before inflation gets there.\u201d \n \n See also: \n \n U.S. economy rebounds in the second quarter \n \n Federal Reserve leaves interest rate unchanged, readies markets for balance sheet changes \n \n Amid resistance, Trump backs away from controversial trade plan ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Average hourly pay was up 2.5% over this time last year, a sluggish pace that has been consistent all year. When the jobless rate is as low as it is, wage growth is typically closer to 4%. Still, the July report comes with a positive milestone: The gains mean the US has now erased the massive job losses caused by the recession, reports the Washington Post. The newspaper cites research by the Brookings Institution showing that, factoring in for population shifts, the nation's employment level is now back to what it was in November 2007. \"It does not mean there's no slack in the economy, [or] that we're at full employment,\" says report co-author Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach. \"But it does mean the job losses from the great recession are behind us.\""

But now sanctions have come, the fear is of what two unpredictable leaders will do next. \n \n Speaking to reporters, Sarah Sanders said: \"We've seen no evidence that Pastor Brunson has done anything wrong.\" \n \n She added that the two Turkish ministers had both played \"leading roles\" in the arrest of the US pastor. \n \n \"As a result, any property or interest in property of both ministers within US jurisdiction is blocked and US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions with them,\" she said. \n \n Ms Sanders also said that President Trump had discussed the matter with President Erdogan \"multiple times\". \n \n Last week, President Trump warned Turkey it would face \"large sanctions\" if it did not release Mr Brunson immediately. \n \n Following Wednesday's announcement, the Turkish lira lost 1.6% of its value to fall to 5.0 against the US dollar. \n \n Who is Andrew Brunson? \n \n Mr Brunson is a long-term resident in Turkey. He lived with his wife and three children while working as the pastor of the small Izmir Resurrection Church, which had a congregation of about two dozen. \n \n The authorities accuse him of having links with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) and the Gulenist movement, which Turkey blames for a 2016 failed coup. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Turkey has urged the US to extradite Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen \n \n Mr Brunson has denied charges of espionage, but faces up to 35 years in jail if found guilty. \n \n He was moved into house arrest last month for health reasons, but US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said this was not enough. \n \n \"We have seen no credible evidence against Mr Brunson,\" Mr Pompeo tweeted at the time. \n \n Turkey's foreign ministry said it had shared \"necessary information\" with the US, but insisted the case should be left with its judiciary. \n \n What is Turkey's motivation? \n \n Mr Brunson is one of 20 Americans who were charged after the coup two years ago, according to the New York Times. \n \n More than 50,000 people were arrested in Turkey in President Erdogan's huge post-coup crackdown. \n \n He blames Pennsylvania-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen for the attempt, but Mr Gulen denies any involvement. \n \n Turkey wants the US to agree to his extradition. Mr Erdogan has indicated he would swap the pastor for \"the priest\" (Mr Gulen). \n \n US support for Kurdish forces fighting the Syrian civil war has also angered Mr Erdogan, who views them as an extension of the PKK. \n \n The PKK - a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy since the 1980s - is considered a terrorist group by Turkey and the US. ||||| Angered At Pastor's Detention, U.S. Levels Sanctions Against Turkish Officials \n \n Enlarge this image toggle caption Stringer/AFP/Getty Images Stringer/AFP/Getty Images \n \n Updated at 5:45 p.m. ET \n \n The U.S. is imposing sanctions against two high-level Turkish officials, retaliating for what the Treasury Department calls the \"unfair and unjust detention\" of an American pastor in Izmir. The penalties announced Wednesday, which aim to punish the chiefs of Turkey's ministries of justice and the interior, mark a significant escalation in the recent frictions between the two key NATO allies. \n \n But they are not altogether unexpected: Both President Trump and Vice President Pence have both lately threatened retaliation over the status of Andrew Brunson, whom Turkish authorities detained in October 2016. He has been charged with engaging in espionage and aiding terrorist groups. \n \n The 50-year-old evangelical Presbyterian minister, who hails from North Carolina but has spent more than two decades in Turkey, was swept up in Ankara's wide-ranging crackdown after a failed coup against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Now under house arrest, Brunson faces up to 35 years in prison if convicted of all charges. \n \n And on Wednesday the Treasury Department laid blame for his ongoing trial primarily with Abdulhamit Gul, Turkey's justice minister, and Turkish Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu. The sanctions against them prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with both men and block any of their property that rests within American jurisdiction. \n \n \"Pastor Brunson's unjust detention and continued prosecution by Turkish officials is simply unacceptable,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. \"President Trump has made it abundantly clear that the United States expects Turkey to release him immediately.\" \n \n U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has also discussed the matter several times with his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, according to State Department spokesperson Heather Nauert. And during a press briefing Tuesday, she noted that Brunson is not the only detained individual they're seeking to get released: She says the State Department has also been advocating on behalf of several locally hired personnel who were also swept up in the arrests after the attempted coup. \n \n \"Turkey knows our position well,\" she said Wednesday. \"This has gone on far too long.\" \n \n The Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs promised Wednesday to retaliate with \"an equivalent response\" if the U.S. does not walk back \"this wrong decision.\" \n \n \"There is no doubt that the decision, which disrespectfully intervenes with our judicial system, stands in contrast to the essence of our relations and will seriously damage the constructive efforts made in order to resolve problems between the two countries,\" the ministry added. \n \n In a tweet translated by the state-run Anadolu news agency, Cavusoglu also vowed that the \"US attempt to impose sanctions on our two ministers will not go unanswered.\" \n \n Faced with pressure from U.S. officials last year, Erdogan suggested Brunson's release may depend on U.S. compliance with one of his own demands: the extradition of elderly Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan has repeatedly accused of organizing the 2016 coup from his compound in Pennsylvania, despite Gulen's denials. \n \n \"\"You have a pastor too,\" Erdogan said then. \"You give us that one and we'll work with our judiciary and give back yours.\" \n \n U.S. officials, for their part, show no inclination to accede to their NATO ally's demand, either. And they have had lawmakers' bipartisan backing in the campaign to obtain Brunson's release. \n \n \"Our fellow citizens aren't bargaining chips,\" Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., said in a statement applauding the sanctions Wednesday. \"Pastor Brunson is an innocent man. Turkey's charges are completely unjust and these new sanctions are absolutely warranted. President Erdogan ought to know that the United States expects more from a member of NATO. Free Pastor Brunson now.\"",

The country's justice minister and interior minister, Abdulhamit Gul and Suleyman Soylu, have been sanctioned over what White House press secretary Sarah Sanders describes as the \"unfair and unjust detention\" of the North Carolina pastor and longtime Turkey resident, who was jailed for around two years before being shifted to house arrest last month, the BBC reports. Brunson was charged with espionage and aiding terrorist groups in the 2016 crackdown that followed a failed coup and faces up to 35 years if convicted on all counts. Sanders said that the sanctions on the NATO ally came after Trump discussed the matter with Turkish leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan \"many times.\" Turkish officials vowed that the sanctions, which ban American companies and individuals from doing business with the men, would not go unanswered, NPR reports.

The hired killers had been paid. They had even explained how they would dispose of the body. \n \n But now, waiting outside her house for the last of the mourners to leave, she was ready to face down the man who had put out a contract for her murder. \n \n \"When I get out of the car, he saw me straight away. He put his hands on his head and said, 'Is it my eyes? Is it a ghost?'\" \n \n \"Surprise!

She had returned to Africa from her home in Melbourne, Australia, to attend her stepmother's funeral. \n \n Image copyright iStock \n \n \"I had lost the last person who I call 'mother',\" she says. \"It was very painful. I was so stressed.\" \n \n By early evening Noela had retreated to her hotel room. As she lay dozing in the stifling city heat of Bujumbura, her phone rang. It was a call from Australia - from Balenga Kalala, her husband and father to her three youngest children. \n \n \"He says he'd been trying to get me for the whole day,\" Noela says. \"I said I was going to bed. He told me, 'To bed? Why are you sleeping so early?' \n \n \"I say, 'I'm not feeling happy'. And he asks me, 'How's the weather? Is it very, very hot?'

He asked me, 'How stupid can you be, from November, you can't see that something is wrong?'\" \n \n He might have been a hit-man with principles, but the gang's leader still took the opportunity to extort more money from Kalala. He called him back and informed him that the fee for the murder had increased. He wanted a further 3,400 Australian dollars (\u00a31,700) to finish the job. \n \n Back at the hotel, Noela's brother was getting worried about her disappearance. He called Kalala in Australia to ask for $545 to pay the police to open an investigation - Kalala feigned concern and duly wired the money. \n \n After two days in captivity, Noela was freed. \n \n \"'We give you 80 hours to leave this country,'\" Noela says the gang told her. \"'Your husband is serious. Maybe we can spare your life, but other people, they're not going to do the same thing. If God helps you, you'll get to Australia.'\" \n \n Before leaving Noela by the side of a road, the gang handed her the evidence they hoped would incriminate Kalala - a memory card containing recorded phone conversations of him discussing the murder and receipts for the Western Union money transfers. \n \n Image copyright Alamy \n \n \"We just want you to go back, to tell other stupid women like you what happened,\" the gang told Noela as they parted. \"You must learn something: you people get a chance to go overseas for a better life.

He had spent the day hosting a steady stream of well-wishers, many of whom donated money. \n \n \"It was around 7.30pm,\" Noela says. \"He was in front of the house. People had been inside mourning with him and he was escorting a group of them into a car.\" \n \n It was as they drove away that Noela sprang her surprise. \n \n \"I was stood just looking at him.

Kalala had stayed at home to look after the couple's three children, as well as Ms Rukundo's five children from previous relationships. \n \n Kalala called Ms Rukundo at about 8pm local time on February 17 and after talking about the hot weather, he told her to go outside to get some fresh air. \n \n Ms Rukundo walked outside and was suddenly approached by a man armed with a gun. \n \n \"This male threatened her with the firearm, told her to remain quiet and forced her into a vehicle,\" the prosecutor said. \"Two other unknown males were in the vehicle.

    "input": "(CNN) -- The winter storm system that walloped the Midwest moved east Friday night, bringing with it not just snow but powerful winds -- all of which made travel perilous and last-minute Christmas shopping more complicated across several states. \n \n Earlier this week, blizzard-like conditions left many locales white less than a week before the holiday. Many communities in central Iowa, for instance, got about a foot of snow, and the city of Madison, Wisconsin, got 15.2 inches Wednesday and Thursday, according to the National Weather Service. \n \n This much snow generally isn't expected as the system moves east, hitting Ohio, Pennsylvania and upstate New York. But that doesn't mean there haven't been -- and won't still be -- plenty of headaches. \n \n Snow is hardly foreign to these areas. But the addition of strong winds, especially in mountainous areas and along the Great Lakes, makes staying on snow-slickened roads even harder. \n \n \"It's scary,\" Esther Boyer told CNN affiliate WDTN, soon after her car slid into a ditch Friday in western Ohio. \"I guess I was just driving too fast, and you should slow down a lot sooner.\" \n \n The lone blizzard warning, in effect Friday night through 6 p.m. Saturday, was for parts of northern West Virginia and north-central Maryland. The National Weather Service predicts 8 to 12 inches of snow and sustained winds of up to 35 mph, with gusts blowing up to 60 mph. \n \n \"Strong winds will cause blowing and drifting of snow with blizzard conditions expected at times with visibilities of one quarter mile or less (and) wind chill temperatures in the single digits ... also possible,\" the agency's forecast said. \"Downed trees and power lines could result from the strongest gusts on Saturday.\" \n \n More populated areas -- many of which, such as Buffalo, Cleveland and Erie, Pennsylvania, were seeing snow around 9 p.m. Friday -- are also expected to be hit hard. \n \n The latter two cities are among those facing a winter storm warning through 7 p.m. Saturday. The weather service's forecast calls for 5 to 7 inches of snow, with 10 inches possible in spots, plus regular winds approaching 30 mph and up to 45-mph gusts by Lake Erie. \n \n A similar warning applies to western Pennsylvania, where 5 to 9 inches of light to moderate snow -- some of it \"heavier, lake-enhanced snow\" -- and gusts as strong as 40 mph are expected. \n \n Even more snow, between 10 to 18 inches, is forecast farther south in Pennsylvania and in northern Maryland, with 50-mph gusts possible. \n \n \"A winter storm warning means that snow will make travel dangerous,\" the weather service said. \"If you must venture out at all, use extreme caution.\" \n \n These advisories follow severe weather farther west that caused major problems earlier this week. \n \n While the city itself was largely spared of snow, Chicago's two airports -- O'Hare and Midway -- were clogged with travelers due to flight cancellations. \n \n Blinding snow is blamed for a 30-car pileup on Interstate 35 near Fort Dodge, Iowa, that killed two people, said Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Scott Bright. It was one of close to 100 weather-related accidents reported around the state by Thursday morning, according to Bright. \n \n CNN's Stefan Simons, Jim Kavanagh, Jareen Imam, Laura Smith-Spark, Carma Hassan and Joe Sutton contributed to this report. ||||| Travelers facing canceled flights and closed roads were hoping to finally head to their holiday destinations as a widespread snowstorm that dumped more than a foot of snow in parts of the Midwest moved across the Great Lakes toward Canada. \n \n CORRECTS NUMBER DEAD TO TWO INSTEAD OF THREE, AND LOCATION OF ACCIDENT TO INTERSTATE 35 INSTEAD OF INTERSTATE 80 - This photo provided by the Iowa State Patrol shows the scene of a 25-vehicle pileup that...

(Associated Press) \n \n The storm, part of a system that began in the Rockies earlier in the week, led airlines to cancel more than 1,000 flights and caused whiteout conditions that left roads dangerous to drive on. It was blamed for deaths in at least five states, with parts of Iowa and Wisconsin hit with more than a foot of snow. \n \n While some people went to work on digging themselves out even as the storm continued Thursday, others had less control: They were stuck waiting for word of new flight times. \n \n Most of the canceled flights were in Chicago, where aviation officials said more than 350 flights were called off at O'Hare International Airport and more than 150 at Midway International Airport. \n \n Southwest Airlines, which canceled all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4:30 p.m. Thursday, was anticipating normal operations Friday morning in Chicago. United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. \n \n Erin Henderson is among the people hoping to get out of O'Hare Friday morning. The 20-year-old college student was trying to return home to Kansas City after five months of studying abroad in Italy when she arrived in Chicago early Thursday evening to learn the last leg of her flight had been canceled. \n \n Exhausted and teary-eyed, Henderson said she planned to get some sleep in a nearby hotel before trying to catch a flight to St Louis early Friday. She said her father planned to drive across Missouri to get her. \n \n \"It was the closest I can get,\" Henderson said. \n \n In Madison, Wis., more than 19 inches of snow fell, prompting the University of Wisconsin at Madison to cancel Thursday's finals. Senior Elle Knutson, 21, said she spent most of the day in her apartment chatting with friends on the Internet and staring out her window at the snow. \n \n \"At first it was kind of nice, but I'm going a little stir-crazy,\" Knutson said Thursday night. \n \n The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa, through Albert Lea, Minn. Iowa and Wisconsin activated National Guard troops to help rescue stranded drivers. \n \n In Iowa, two people were killed and seven injured in a 25-vehicle pileup. Drivers were blinded by blowing snow and didn't see vehicles that had slowed or stopped on Interstate 35 about 60 miles north of Des Moines, state police said. A chain reaction of crashes involving semitrailers and passenger cars closed down a section of the highway. \n \n Three other states also had traffic deaths that were blamed on the storm. There were at least two deaths in each Nebraska and Wisconsin, and one in Kansas. \n \n In southeastern Utah, a woman who tried to walk for help after her car became stuck in snow died Tuesday night. \n \n On the southern edge of the storm system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs in Alabama. \n \n The flight cancellations were getting a lot of attention because the storm came just a few days before Christmas. But Daniel Baker, CEO of flight tracking service FlightAware.com, called it \"a relatively minor event in the overall scheme of things.\" \n \n By comparison, airlines canceled more than 13,000 flights over a two-day period during a February 2011 snowstorm that hit the Midwest. And more than 20,000 flights were canceled during Superstorm Sandy. \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa; Margery Beck in Omaha, Neb.; Jeff Baenen in Minneapolis; Scott Mayerowitz in New York; Carrie Antlfinger in Milwaukee; Heather Hollingsworth in Kansas City, Mo.; Jason Keyser in Chicago; Barbara Rodriguez in Des Moines; and Ryan J.

Restoring normal road traffic in the region could take longer. (Dec. 21) AP \n \n Blizzard warnings were in effect in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Illinois, according to the National Weather Service. The Weather Channel reported that parts of 17 states are under winter weather advisories -- as far west as Washington state and as far east as Maine. \n \n The storm brought much-needed precipitation for drought-plagued regions but was bad news for holiday travelers. Most of the nation's big airlines responded to the storm's threat by enacting flexible rebooking policies for passengers scheduled to fly into the storm's path. \n \n The storm led airlines to cancel about 1,000 flights ahead of the Christmas holiday \u2014 relatively few compared to past big storms, though the number was climbing. \n \n More than 600 flights were canceled at Chicago's two airports, O'Hare and Midway. O'Hare is a major hub for both United and American, meaning the disruption could ripple out and affect fliers at other airports. \n \n MORE: Storm snarls flights in Chicago, Midwest \n \n Southwest Airlines, which canceled all of its flights out of its Midway hub after 4:30 p.m. Thursday, was anticipating normal operations Friday morning in Chicago. \n \n United Airlines also planned to operate a full schedule, though spokeswomen for both airlines cautioned travelers to check their flight status before heading to the airport. \n \n American Airlines cancelled flights scheduled to depart after 8 p.m. CT on Thursday. \n \n The snowstorm walloped Iowa, where almost a foot of snow has fallen in Des Moines. State police said a 25-vehicle pileup killed at least two people, and across Iowa 30,900 customers were without power Thursday, including more than 25,000 in the Des Moines area. \n \n The storm dropped as much as 13 inches of snow on portions of central Iowa, paralyzed travel, knocked out power to scores of people and closed schools, government offices and businesses across the state. \n \n \"It's just awful out there,\" Capt. Mike Winter of the Iowa State Patrol said. \"People need to just stay home.\" \n \n The storm made travel difficult from Kansas to Wisconsin, forcing road closures, including a 120-mile stretch of Interstate 35 from Ames, Iowa through Albert Lea, Minnesota. \n \n Most major roads across Iowa remained closed either by official order or impassible due to snow and ice buildup late Thursday. \n \n The Iowa State Patrol said at least 88 crashes occurred on highways and interstate systems Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon. There were also at least 164 emergency calls from the public and 161 motorist assists. \n \n On the southern edge of the storm system, tornadoes destroyed several homes in Arkansas and peeled the roofs from buildings, toppled trucks and blew down oak trees and limbs Alabama. \n \n In southeastern Wisconsin, where a blizzard warning was in effect, sheriff's officials said slick conditions led to at least two fatalities late Wednesday when a driver lost control of his car in Rock County, about 90 miles northwest of Chicago. \n \n The weather service was forecasting \"thundersnow\" in Milwaukee and the surrounding areas, where snow could fall at the rate of 2-3 inches an hour. \n \n Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker issued an executive order declaring a state of emergency, which put the state emergency government, National Guard, State Patrol and other agencies on high alert. \n \n At least two people in Nebraska died in crashes blamed on poor driving conditions, the State Patrol said. In many areas, drivers were being told to stay off the roads because of whiteout conditions. Most of I-80 in the state was closed. Nebraska's biggest school districts canceled classes, as did many districts across the region. \n \n In Utah, Washington County sheriff's detective Nate Abbott says the woman and a man were driving when their car got stuck in rural Washington County on Tuesday night during the storm that hit the Rocky Mountain region. \n \n He says the pair started walking for help, but the woman couldn't go any farther and sought shelter while the man continued on. Search-and-rescue teams later found her body. \n \n Although the Plains and Midwest could do without the travel headaches, precipitation should be welcome. \n \n More than 93% of the high Plains region and 54% of the Midwest are enduring drought conditions, according to Thursday's U.S. Drought Monitor, a federal website that tracks drought. \n \n Out west, the leading edge of a powerful storm system arrived in Washington, Oregon and Northern California. Rain is expected across Northern California from late Thursday through the weekend, with heavy snow possible in the Sierra Nevada range as the system moves east. \n \n Four to seven feet of snow is forecast to fall above 7,000 feet, prompting the U.S. Forest Service to issue an avalanche warning for Mount Shasta. \n \n Contributing: Ben Mutzabaugh, USA TODAY; Michael Winter, USA TODAY; the Associated Press; The Des Moines Register \n \n Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/RHTLA8",

    "input": "The publication of Albert Einstein\u2019s private diaries detailing his tour of Asia in the 1920s reveals the theoretical physicist and humanitarian icon\u2019s racist attitudes to the people he met on his travels, particularly the Chinese. \n \n Written between October 1922 and March 1923, the diaries see the scientist musing on his travels, science, philosophy and art. In China, the man who famously once described racism as \u201ca disease of white people\u201d describes the \u201cindustrious, filthy, obtuse people\u201d he observes. He notes how the \u201cChinese don\u2019t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.\u201d After earlier writing of the \u201cabundance of offspring\u201d and the \u201cfecundity\u201d of the Chinese, he goes on to say: \u201cIt would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.\u201d \n \n Ze\u2019ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology, said: \u201cI think a lot of comments strike us as pretty unpleasant \u2013 what he says about the Chinese in particular. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon. I think it\u2019s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements. They\u2019re more off guard, he didn\u2019t intend them for publication.\u201d \n \n Facebook Twitter Pinterest A page from Einstein\u2019s travel journals, written while in China in 1922. Photograph: With permission of the Albert Einstein Archives, the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and the Morgan Library & Museum \n \n Rosenkranz has edited and translated The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein, which have just been published for the first time as a standalone volume by Princeton University Press, including facsimiles of the diary pages. The diaries have only previously been published in German as part of the 15-volume Collected Papers of Albert Einstein, with small supplementary translations into English. A spokesperson for Princeton University Press said: \u201cThis is the first time Einstein\u2019s travel diary will be made available to anyone who isn\u2019t a serious Einstein scholar.\u201d \n \n Further passages in the diaries, which are thought to have been written for Einstein\u2019s stepdaughters in Berlin while he and his wife were travelling in Asia, Spain and Palestine, and as an aide memoire, see him writing of the Chinese that \u201ceven those reduced to working like horses never give the impression of conscious suffering. A peculiar herd-like nation [ \u2026 ] often more like automatons than people.\u201d He later adds, in Rosenkranz\u2019s words, \u201ca healthy dose of extreme misogyny\u201d to his xenophobia with the observation: \u201cI noticed how little difference there is between men and women; I don\u2019t understand what kind of fatal attraction Chinese women possess which enthrals the corresponding men to such an extent that they are incapable of defending themselves against the formidable blessing of offspring\u201d. \n \n In Colombo in Ceylon, Einstein writes of how the locals \u201clive in great filth and considerable stench at ground level\u201d adding that they \u201cdo little, and need little. The simple economic cycle of life.\u201d \n \n Einstein\u2019s perceptions of the Japanese he meets are, in contrast, more positive: \u201cJapanese unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing,\u201d he writes. \u201cPure souls as nowhere else among people. One has to love and admire this country.\u201d But Rosenkranz points out that he also concludes that the \u201cintellectual needs of this nation seem to be weaker than their artistic ones \u2013 natural disposition?\u201d \n \n \u201cEinstein\u2019s diary entries on the biological origin of the alleged intellectual inferiority of the Japanese, Chinese, and Indians are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist \u2013 in these instances, other peoples are portrayed as being biologically inferior, a clear hallmark of racism. The disquieting comment that the Chinese may \u2018supplant all other races\u2019 is also most revealing in this regard,\u201d writes Rosenkranz. \n \n \u201cHere, Einstein perceives a foreign \u2018race\u2019 as a threat, which \u2026 is one of the characteristics of a racist ideology. Yet the remark that must strike the modern reader as most offensive is his feigning not to understand how Chinese men can find their women sufficiently attractive to have offspring with them. In light of these instances, we must conclude that Einstein did make quite a few racist and dehumanising comments in the diary, some of which were extremely unpleasant.\u201d \n \n Rosenkranz told the Guardian that although views like Einstein\u2019s were prevalent at the time, they were not universal. \u201cThat\u2019s usually the reaction I get \u2013 \u2018we have to understand, he was of the zeitgeist, part of the time\u2019 \u2013 but I think I tried here and there to give a broader context. There were other views out there, more tolerant views,\u201d he said. \n \n In his introduction, Rosenkranz writes how it is important to explore how a humanist icon such as Einstein \u2013 whose image was once used for a UNHCR campaign with the slogan \u201cA bundle of belongings isn\u2019t the only thing a refugee brings to his new country. Einstein was a refugee\u201d \u2013 could have written xenophobic comments about the peoples he encountered. \n \n \u201cThe answer to this question seems very relevant in today\u2019s world, in which the hatred of the other is so rampant in so many places around the world,\u201d he writes. \u201cIt seems that even Einstein sometimes had a very hard time recognising himself in the face of the other.\u201d ||||| Albert Einstein is not just revered as the scientist behind the theory of relativity but also as a humanitarian icon. However, excerpts of the physicist\u2019s private diaries, which detail his travels around Spain, Palestine, Japan, China, and Singapore in the early 1920s, will significantly diminish his stature as the latter. \n \n The Nobel Prize winner and civil rights advocate is remembered for his stance against discrimination, both in his native Germany and in the United States. In a speech at Lincoln University in 1946\u2014the first US institution to grant degrees to African-Americans\u2014he famously stated that racism was a \u201cdisease of white people.\u201d \n \n And yet, The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein reveal that his impressions of people he met were, in fact, racist.

He describes \u201cindustrious, filthy, obtuse people\u201d he met on his travels, and is particularly racist towards the Chinese, writing that \u201cit would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.\u201d \n \n The senior editor of the published diaries, Ze\u2019ev Rosenkranz, told the Guardian that Einstein\u2019s observations, in no uncertain terms, underpin many of the racist ideas about the inferiority of races that persist today. \n \n \u201cEinstein\u2019s diary entries on the biological origin of the alleged intellectual inferiority of the Japanese, Chinese, and Indians are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist\u2014in these instances, other people are portrayed as being biologically inferior, a clear hallmark of racism. The disquieting comment that the Chinese may \u2018supplant all other races\u2019 is also most revealing in this regard.\u201d ||||| Albert Einstein\u2019s racist attitudes towards Chinese people have been revealed following the publication of travel diaries he kept during a visit to Asia in the 1920s. \n \n The previously unseen journals have been published by Princeton University Press, documenting the scientist\u2019s five-and-a-half month travels between 1922 and 1923 to China, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Japan, as well as Palestine and Spain. \n \n The publisher describes the diaries as detailing Einstein\u2019s \u201cquirky, succinct, and at times irreverent\u201d musings on science, philosophy, art and politics, adding the handwritten journals also reveal his \u201cstereotyping of members of various nations and raise questions about his attitudes on race.\u201d \n \n In one excerpt, seen by The Guardian, Einstein describes the Chinese as \u201cindustrious, filthy, obtuse people,\u201d later calling them a \u201cpeculiar herd-like nation\u2026 often more like automatons than people.\u201d \n \n \"It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary,\u201d he adds. \n \n In another entry, Einstein described how \u201cChinese don\u2019t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.\u201d \n \n The book, The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein: The Far East, Palestine, and Spain, 1922\u20131923, was edited by Ze\u2019ev Rosenkranz, senior editor and assistant director of the Einstein Papers Project at the California Institute of Technology. \n \n Keystone/Getty Images) \n \n Speaking to The Guardian, Rosenkranz admits that some of the passenges written by Einstein are \u201cpretty unpleasant\u2014what he says about the Chinese in particular.\u201d \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re kind of in contrast to the public image of the great humanitarian icon,\" he adds. \"I think it\u2019s quite a shock to read those and contrast them with his more public statements.They\u2019re more off guard, he didn\u2019t intend them for publication.\u201d \n \n Einstein became an American citizen in 1940 after deciding he could not to return to his native Germany following the rise of the Nazi party and Adolf Hitler. The Nobel Prize-winning physicist famously described racism as a \u201cdisease of white people\u201d during a speech at Pennsylvania\u2019s Lincoln University in 1946. \n \n In a Q and A with the Einstein Papers project to promote the book, Rosenkranz said that writing about a famous historical figure's personal life can provide \u201cfascinating insights\u201d about their personalities. \n \n \u201cThe intention is not salacious but rather a genuine attempt to understand what makes such celebrities tick,\u201d he adds. \u201cThis is particularly pertinent in Einstein's case, where there is such a great discrepancy between the public image and the actual historical individual. \u201d",
    "reference": "\u2013 In a 1946 speech, Albert Einstein described racism as a \"disease of white people.\" He apparently had it, as revealed in the genius's travel diaries, published entirely in English for the first time, per Quartz. Describing travels through China, Singapore, Japan, Palestine, and Spain between 1922 and 1923, per Newsweek, Einstein's writing shows an apparent obsession with the word \"obtuse\" and an overall unfavorable attitude toward Chinese people. He describes them as \"industrious, filthy, obtuse people\" with an \"abundance\" of \"obtuse\" offspring, reports the Guardian. Commenting on \"little difference\" between Chinese men and women, he goes on to wonder \"what kind of fatal attraction\" females possess that \"enthrals the corresponding men.\" \"It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races,\" Einstein continues. \"For the likes of us, the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.\" His opinions \"are definitely not understated and can be viewed as racist,\" editor and translator Ze'ev Rosenkranz tells the Guardian. \"In these instances, other peoples are portrayed as being biologically inferior, a clear hallmark of racism.\" This is especially apparent as Einstein describes Japanese people as \"altogether very appealing\" and \"pure souls as nowhere else among people.\" As more tolerant views were held during his lifetime, \"it seems that even Einstein sometimes had a very hard time recognizing himself in the face of the other,\" writes Rosenkranz in the introduction to The Travel Diaries of Albert Einstein. He adds that a discussion of Einstein's views, contrasting with his public image as a humanitarian icon, \"seems very relevant in today's world, in which the hatred of the other is so rampant.\" (A scrap of paper Einstein scribbled on recently sold at auction for a record price.)"

A deadly weekend shootout involving rival motorcycle gangs at... (Associated Press) \n \n Waco police Sgt. W. Patrick Swanton said an uninvited group appeared for Sunday's meeting of a loose confederation of biker gangs at a restaurant. \n \n One man was injured when a vehicle rolled over his foot. That caused a dispute that continued inside the restaurant, where fighting and then shooting began, before the melee spilled back outside, Swanton said. \n \n Authorities offered few details. It was not clear which gang was responsible for running over the biker's foot or which gang the aggrieved biker belonged to. \n \n When the shootout was over, nine people were dead and 18 wounded. \n \n Police have said five biker gangs from across Texas had gathered in part to settle differences over turf. \n \n Jimmy Graves, who described himself as an ambassador for the gang known as the Bandidos, disputed that claim, saying the groups had planned to discuss laws protecting motorcycle riders and other topics such as trademarks for club logos. \n \n But he acknowledged that differences with other groups, such as the Cossacks, have been \"simmering and brewing.\" \n \n Another biker named Johnny Snyder said he was at the restaurant for a quarterly meeting to talk about legislative issues. \n \n Snyder, a long-haul trucker, declined to describe what he saw inside the restaurant, saying he was only concerned with \"not getting shot.\" \n \n He is vice president of the Boozefighters Motorcycle Club in Waco, a group that Snyder says hosts charity events and family gatherings and is not a criminal gang. \n \n About 50 weapons were confiscated, mostly knives and firearms, and Swanton said more than 100 weapons may be found once authorities are done analyzing the crime scene at the Twin Peaks restaurant, which is part of a national chain that features waitresses in revealing uniforms. \n \n Preliminary autopsy results showed all nine of the dead were killed by gunshots. Many were hit in the head, neck, chest or torso. Most of the men were in their 40s, but they ranged in age from 27 to 65, according to reports released by a McLennan County justice of the peace. \n \n Police have acknowledged firing on armed bikers, but it was unclear how many of the dead were shot by gang members and how many were shot by officers. \n \n Of the injured, seven remain hospitalized. Swanton, who has been virtually the sole source of law enforcement information on the fight, described their conditions as stable. \n \n He said the investigation is being hampered by witnesses who \"are not being honest with us.\" \n \n Police are concerned that the brawl will invite retaliation and more violence, Swanton said. \n \n \"We would encourage them to try to be a little peaceful and let the bloodshed stop,\" he said. \n \n About 170 bikers have been charged with engaging in organized crime.

When the Cossack member refused to remove the Texas patch from his vest, the Bandidos hit him in the head with a hammer and stole it. \n \n The Department of Public Safety declined to release the bulletin to The Associated Press. \n \n There are other documented instances of violence between the groups. \n \n Last March, two members of the Bandidos were indicted in connection with the stabbing of two Cossacks at an Abilene steakhouse. \n \n And in December, three Bandidos were arrested for a shooting at a Fort Worth motorcycle bar that left one dead and two others wounded. Fort Worth police said the victims were known members of a criminal motorcycle gang. \n \n The Bandidos \"constitute a growing criminal threat,\" the Justice Department said in a report on outlaw motorcycle gangs.

    "reference": "\u2013 Outlaw motorcycle gangs are in the spotlight after Sunday's slaughter in Waco, though law enforcement officials say they've been thriving for many years out of the public eye. \"These guys have never gone away. I'm shocked that people are shocked that this happened,\" the ATF's Los Angeles chief tells the Wall Street Journal. He was part of a team that infiltrated the Hells Angels more than a decade ago. The Hells Angels, along with the Bandidos, are among the biggest outlaw groups in the US, but the Justice Department says there are more than 300 active ones, the Journal reports. The Waco shootout is believed to have stemmed from a Bandidos-Cossacks feud over the latter club's wearing of a \"Texas\" patch. Police in Waco have called for a truce between biker factions, the Waco Tribune-Herald reports. A police spokesman says the fighting on Sunday appears to have started after a biker's foot was run over outside the Twin Peaks restaurant, though he adds that investigators are finding witnesses and suspects deceptive. Around 170 bikers charged with engaging in organized crime are still in custody, though the wife of one of them tells the AP plenty of innocent bikers were rounded up. She says her husband\u2014a member of the Vise Grip club\u2014had just arrived when the shooting started. He took off and was arrested when he came back for his bike, she says.

( Hyoung Chang, The Denver Post ) \n \n Beefy, black-clad security officers \u2014 donning bulletproof vests and perched on a scaffolding \u2014 peered across Civic Center park through military-style binoculars Saturday as crowds began to grow for the first day of Denver's 4/20 rally. \n \n Teams of security officers performed \"soft\" body patdowns and backpack searches before allowing people through any of the several entry gates. An officer only half-jokingly said he was checking for guns, knives and high explosives. \n \n The watch tower and patdowns are just a few of the enhanced security measures for this year's 4/20 event that were noticeably absent from the 2013 gathering, marred by the shooting of two people in the leg, as well as a stampede toward the stage. Also, a third person was grazed by a bullet in the shooting. \n \n \"It's presidential-style security,\" chief organizer Miguel Lopez boasted about this weekend. \n \n He was more sheepish when he spoke of last year's security breaches, when a crowd tumbled through a barricade and trampled one another while ascending the stage. \n \n This year, Lopez hired three security companies to patrol the two-day event. Glendale Mayor Mike Dunafon, who is running for governor as an independent, also hired a captain and a lieutenant from his department to help. He paid for it himself. One of the security teams had 40 security guards carrying guns and handcuffs. \n \n \"We're armed and everything,\" said Jesse Pe\u00f1a, owner of Special Agent Security Service. \"If we see a crime happen, we do an arrest and then just get a police officer.\" \n \n Advertisement \n \n Police issued citations to a couple of the private security guards for lacking the appropriate license, said Denver police spokesman Sonny Jackson. \n \n Part of the reason for enhanced security are projections that because of legal marijuana, the crowds of people from across the country are likely to at least double last year's numbers. Lopez was expecting 80,000 visitors Sunday. \n \n The Denver Police Department \u2014 which said it had cited or arrested 25 people, 17 for public marijuana smoking, on Saturday \u2014 invited state and federal law enforcement officers to tour its command center at police headquarters a block away. The communications center has about 50 TV screens that can flip back and forth to 138 HALO and 38 traffic cameras. \n \n Pat Phelan, commander of the department's special-operations unit, said the cameras will ensure rapid deployment of a beefed-up downtown police presence Saturday and Sunday. \n \n \"We don't expect to see a problem, but we're prepared if there is,\" Cmdr. Matt Murray said Saturday. \n \n Avid marijuana inhaler Guy Orvis, 62, of Denver, who rode to the festival in a wheelchair rigged out like a lounge chair, said the extra security makes a lot of sense. \n \n \"It puts everybody on notice to keep it on the down low. I'm not about violence or anything,\" he said. \n \n He denied that the smoke \u2014 with a particular scent \u2014 pumping out of a cannister at the back of his wheelchair was cannabis-infused. But a small crowd of people followed him around the park sniffing deeply and giggling. ||||| DENVER (AP) \u2014 Once the province of activists and stoners, the traditional pot holiday of April 20 has gone mainstream in the first state in the nation to legalize recreational marijuana. \n \n Partygoers dance to live music and smoke pot on the first of two days at the annual 4/20 marijuana festival in Denver, Saturday April 19, 2014.

(Associated Press) \n \n With the Colorado state capitol building visible in the background, partygoers dance to live music and smoke pot on the first of two days at the annual 4/20 marijuana festival in Denver, Saturday April... (Associated Press) \n \n Tens of thousands gathered for a weekend of Colorado cannabis-themed festivals and entertainment, from a marijuana industry expo called the Cannabis Cup at a trade center north of downtown, to 4/20-themed concerts at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater \u2014 acts include Slightly Stoopid and Snoop Dogg \u2014 to a massive festival in the shadow of the state capitol where clouds of cannabis smoke are expected to waft at 4:20 p.m. MDT Sunday. \n \n The festival in Denver's Civic Center Park is the most visible sign of the transformation. It started as a defiant gathering of marijuana activists, but this year the event has an official city permit, is organized by an events management company and featured booths selling funnel cakes and Greek food next to kiosks hawking hemp lollipops and glass pipes. \n \n Gavin Beldt, one of the organizers, said in a statement that the event is now a \"celebration of legal status for its use in Colorado and our launch of an exciting new experience for those attending. \" \n \n On Saturday, the first day of the two-day festival, only a few people lingered on the steps of a Roman-style amphitheater where marijuana activists spoke angrily about bans on the drug in other states. Thousands instead lingered on the park's broad lawns, listening to hip-hop music blasting from the sound stage and enjoying the fresh, albeit marijuana-scented, air. \n \n \"It's a lot mellower this year,\" said Cody Andrews, 29, of Denver. \"It's more of a venue now. More vendor-y.\" \n \n Last year's event was marred by an unsolved shooting that wounded three. This year a fence rings the park. Security guards in protective gear roam the grounds, and all entrants are being checked for weapons. \n \n Earlier this year, there was tension when some organizers wanted to officially sanction a 4:20 p.m. Sunday smokeout, but the city noted that public consumption of marijuana is still illegal in Colorado. By Saturday night, Denver police said they had issued at least 17 citations for public pot smoking. \n \n Still, participants expect to light up on Sunday, which happens to also be Easter Sunday. Plenty weren't waiting until 4/20 proper. On Saturday, Jairin Genung, 25, of Aurora, sat on the grass with friends, including one who was carefully rolling a thick joint. \n \n \"We're going to light up no matter what,\" Genung said. \"If you can't smoke at the 4/20 rally, it just doesn't make sense.\" \n \n The whole scene was wonderfully surreal for Bud Long, 49, from Kalamazoo, Mich., who recalled taking part in his first 4/20 protest in 1984. \n \n \"Nationwide, it'll be decriminalized,\" he predicted, \"and we'll be doing this in every state.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Follow Nicholas Riccardi on Twitter at https://twitter.com/NickRiccardi . ||||| Story highlights Tens of thousands turn out for first 420 celebration since Colorado began legal pot sales \n \n \"420 Rally,\" Cannabis Cup competition, Snoop Dogg concert among highlights \n \n Many traveled from out of state, even abroad, to buy and smoke marijuana legally \n \n CannaBUS takes hundreds to dispensaries; expo puts weed business on display \n \n Coming to the Mile High City this weekend was the perfect 65th birthday present for Karen Stevenson.

Hide Caption 21 of 21 EXPAND GALLERY \n \n Weed and a tale of two cities \n \n Though the date has long been observed in Colorado, this is the first celebration since recreational sales of marijuana became legal here on New Year's Day. (Recreational use became legal in late 2012.) \n \n Replete with the Denver \"420 Rally\" in Civic Center Park, the High Times Cannabis Cup -- an expo and a competition sponsored by the magazine -- and a 420 concert at Red Rocks Amphitheatre headlined by Snoop Dogg, the weekend has drawn the trappings one might expect. Dreadlocks. Tie-dye. T-shirts brandishing phrases like \"Cheech & Chong for President.\" \n \n Those predictable, or stereotypical, images, however, only tell part of the story. \n \n They don't speak for the white-haired Mississippi man who looked like he'd walked out of a law firm on casual Friday. They don't reflect what drew a Crohn's disease patient from Missouri. Nor do they represent three older Texas women, one with her nails perfectly manicured in hot pink and her hair done just so, who advocate on behalf of seniors and are working to reform marijuana laws. \n \n \"We're not trying to force people to smoke pot,\" said Dawn Brooks, 62, of Austin, the one with the bright nails. \"Cannabis is merely a plant. That's all it is. And more and more seniors are coming out of the closet.\" \n \n This is a weekend that draws people of various backgrounds and with different needs and desires. \n \n That said, for many of those who turned out Saturday, the vast majority it seemed from out-of-state, it was all about the smoking. And for some of them, it was in a frenzied way -- a mad rush to try everything because they couldn't take any of it home. \n \n Kate, a 30-year-old from Kansas City, Missouri, was waiting with her boyfriend, Scott, for a free bus ride to the Cannabis Cup expo at Denver Mart. \n \n \"It's like his Super Bowl,\" said Kate, who, like many people we spoke to, didn't want her last name used. \"He's been giddy about it for weeks. ... Super stoked is an understatement.\" \n \n Bus to Show, a nonprofit that works to reduce intoxicated driving, partnered with High Times to offer transportation this weekend. It set up a downtown location for pickups and drop-offs outside Cheba Hut, a marijuana-themed sub shop. \n \n Besides the free shuttles to and from the expo, the organization sold out a $20-a-day hop-on, hop-off shuttle tour of what it called The Cannabis Freedom Trail. The CannaBUS, as the tour shuttles are called, have been shepherding as many as 200 people a day to various cannabis dispensaries around town. \n \n On one tour we joined, smoke wafted out windows. Strangers shared pipes and exchanged samples of weed and wax, a concentrated form of marijuana. Canisters of buds bearing names like \"tangerine haze\" and \"strawberry cough,\" were passed around to smell. Nutella pancakes came up in conversations at least three times. \n \n Wearing a neon green wig and green Power Ranger mini-dress, Teri Starbird, 50, who lives outside Wichita, Kansas, lit up some \"Bruce Banner.\" It is one of the contenders in this year's Cannabis Cup competition. \n \n \"Oh, that's very smooth,\" she said, passing the pipe to her friend. \"But I'll tell you what, there are some mad scientists in this town. Some of this stuff makes you plain stupid.\" \n \n While other groups actually visited dispensaries on the tour, no one in this crew bothered to get off the bus. Two guys from South Jersey sat dazed, staring out their windows. \n \n \"I'm too f**king stoned to get out,\" said a 22-year-old from New Mexico, who donned a Captain America baseball cap and heroically bounded over bus seats to take a hit of what others were smoking. \n \n Back at the sandwich shop, the final stop on the tour, he and the others had no choice but to stumble off the bus. \n \n \"Chaz\" shows off his marijuana-themed hat during the 420 Rally at Civic Center Park in Denver. \n \n Inside Cheba Hut, where 12-inch subs are called \"blunts,\" drinks are listed as \"cotton mouth cures\" and desserts and chips fall under \"munchies,\" a woman from Brooklyn, New York, stared up at the menu board -- her eyes as wide as her smile. \n \n \"Oh, my God, that bread's crazy,\" she said loudly to no one. \"Oh, my God, they have Kool-Aid here! What?\" \n \n Outside, bus driver Jody Stonebraker called us on board for the free ride to the expo. She offered lighters and bottles of water to her passengers as she drove them to Denver Mart, where tens of thousands gathered for the High Times Cannabis Cup. With bus windows open to keep her sober, she moved us on. \n \n A guy from San Francisco struggled to roll a joint; when the bus stopped short, his weed went flying. A man from Florida looked around at the peaceful, smiling faces of his fellow passengers and wanted to know where else people were this happy. And a conversation across the aisle between two people began and ended like this: \n \n \"What was your favorite?\" \n \n \"Green.\" \n \n \"What?\" \n \n Stonebraker, 54, said she's met people this weekend from all over the country, even the world -- including Germany, Japan and Mexico. She can't stop singing the praises of her cannabis-loving passengers. \n \n \"It's been so fun, and I'm getting paid for this,\" she said. \"I tended bar for 16 years, and they were all jerks. Every other person, you wanted to shoot. You guys are awesome!\" \n \n JUST WATCHED This is your body on weed Replay More Videos ...

People who waited three hours to get into Denver Mart boasted that there were no fights, screaming or pushing. \n \n A couple from Kansas City, Missouri, was among those who waited for hours to get in, but Sam, 58, and Joyce, 53, couldn't have looked less put out. They were draped in Mardi Gras beads. He wore a jester's hat; she a crown made of plastic marijuana leaves. They were simply thrilled. \n \n \"Nobody's tripping. Nobody's acting like you're from Mars,\" Joyce said. \"There's freedom to smoke. You don't have to hide in a basement or under a blanket.\" \n \n The couple, married for 32 years, raised children successfully. Sam spent 35 years working his tail off in the commercial roofing business. \n \n \"So don't tell me it makes me lazy,\" he said. \n \n In hallways outside the exhibition hall, people sat on the floor, tossing back small bags of Cheetos and Doritos. A man was hunched over in a corner, taking a nap. Another guy greeted people just inside, offering patriotic-looking stickers that resembled those handed out on Election Day -- except these said \"I Smoked.\" \n \n A stroll past the booths in the packed hall offered a head-spinning glimpse into the big business that is cannabis. \n \n There were hydrocarbon extraction machines, easy at-home growing systems, and high-powered leaf trimmers. There were academies offering certification courses, products to detoxify the body, and tips and tools to make edibles. There were cannabis-themed clothing companies, glass pipes available in all shapes -- including that of Mr. Potato Head -- and people sitting beneath lights and in front of cameras for a segment of The Plant Channel. \n \n There was even an agency called Hemp Temps, to meet the staffing needs of the growing industry. \n \n Behind the building, in a fenced-in outdoor area where 21-and-over wristbands were checked before entry, the smoke was thick. \n \n Attendees crowded couches beneath tents, sampling wares. A grown man, dressed as an Oompa-Loompa, walked by as another guy inhaled smoke from a three-foot-long bong. An emergency medical team tended to an older man who passed out, his head bleeding from when it hit the pavement after he smoked a dab, or high-grade hash oil. \n \n Photos: Retail pot shops open in Colorado 21 photos Photos: Retail pot shops open in Colorado 21 photos Retail pot shops open in Colorado \u2013 Customers wait in a long line for their turn to buy recreational marijuana outside the LoDo Wellness Center on Wednesday, January 1, in Denver.

    "input": "Reuters Health - Parents who delay or skip childhood vaccinations even when kids have no medical reason to avoid their shots are contributing to U.S. outbreaks of measles and pertussis, a research review suggests. \n \n A vial of measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and an information sheet is seen at Boston Children's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts February 26, 2015. REUTERS/Brian Snyder \n \n More than half of 1,416 measles cases reported in the U.S. since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000 were for people with no history of measles vaccination, the analysis found. \n \n Among more than 10,000 pertussis patients with known vaccination status, 24 to 45 percent of people in the five largest statewide epidemics since 1977 were unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated, the analysis also found. \n \n \u201cIf there are a high number of susceptible or unvaccinated individuals in the community the risk of getting infected \u2013 even for vaccinated children \u2013 goes up,\u201d said senior study author Dr. Saad Omer, a pediatrics and epidemiology researcher at Emory University in Atlanta. \n \n That\u2019s because few vaccines are 100 percent effective, Omer added by email. \n \n With pertussis, or whooping cough, up to 2 percent of people who receive all five recommended vaccine doses on time may still get this bacterial infection of the lungs, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \n \n For measles, roughly 3 percent of people who receive both recommended doses of the vaccine may still get the virus, according to the CDC. \n \n These numbers are a best case scenario, assuming that only people with medical reasons \u2013 like certain cancer treatments, rare allergies to vaccine ingredients, or diseases that compromise the immune system \u2013 forgo inoculations. \n \n But the CDC reports that fewer than 1 percent of kids need to skip vaccines for medical reasons, based on data from Mississippi and West Virginia, states that only grant exemptions under these circumstances. \n \n Instead, Omer and colleagues found that the majority of measles and pertussis cases in the outbreaks they analyzed were due to people intentionally skipping vaccinations. \n \n Among 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data, 574 cases were unvaccinated people who were eligible to receive their shots, researchers report in the Journal of the American Medical Association. \n \n Most of these unvaccinated people \u2013 405 of them \u2013 had nonmedical reasons for skipping vaccinations such as religious or philosophical objections, the analysis found. \n \n For the subset of pertussis reports from outbreaks with detailed data on unvaccinated individuals, 59 to 93 percent of cases were for people who intentionally skipped their inoculations, the analysis also found. \n \n Several pertussis cases also cropped up in highly vaccinated communities, suggesting waning immunity against the disease, the researchers note. \n \n Limitations of the study include a focus on measles and pertussis in the context of vaccine exemption rates, which may have underestimated the disease risk associated with skipping vaccines, the authors point out. \n \n Nonmedical exemptions also don\u2019t explain all of the resurgence in measles and pertussis in recent years, Dr. Matthew Davis, a pediatrics researcher and deputy director of the Institute for Healthcare Policy and Innovation at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, noted in an editorial. \n \n \u201cIt is very difficult to put a specific number on how much vaccine refusals reduce a community\u2019s protection against disease,\u201d Davis said by email. \n \n \u201cWhat this latest comprehensive review illustrates is that individuals who refuse vaccines not only put themselves at risk for disease,\u201d Davis added. \u201cIt turns out that they also put others at risk too \u2013 even people who have been vaccinated before, but whose protection from those vaccinations may not be as strong as it used to be.\u201d \n \n SOURCE: bit.ly/1Rj5JhT JAMA, online March 15, 2016. ||||| Importance Parents hesitant to vaccinate their children may delay routine immunizations or seek exemptions from state vaccine mandates. Recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in the United States have drawn attention to this phenomenon. Improved understanding of the association between vaccine refusal and the epidemiology of these diseases is needed. \n \n Objective To review the published literature to evaluate the association between vaccine delay, refusal, or exemption and the epidemiology of measles and pertussis, 2 vaccine-preventable diseases with recent US outbreaks. \n \n Evidence Review Search of PubMed through November 30, 2015, for reports of US measles outbreaks that have occurred since measles was declared eliminated in the United States (after January 1, 2000), endemic and epidemic pertussis since the lowest point in US pertussis incidence (after January 1, 1977), and for studies that assessed disease risk in the context of vaccine delay or exemption. \n \n Findings We identified 18 published measles studies (9 annual summaries and 9 outbreak reports), which described 1416 measles cases (individual age range, 2 weeks-84 years; 178 cases younger than 12 months) and more than half (56.8%) had no history of measles vaccination. Of the 970 measles cases with detailed vaccination data, 574 cases were unvaccinated despite being vaccine eligible and 405 (70.6%) of these had nonmedical exemptions (eg, exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons, as opposed to medical contraindications; 41.8% of total). Among 32 reports of pertussis outbreaks, which included 10 609 individuals for whom vaccination status was reported (age range, 10 days-87 years), the 5 largest statewide epidemics had substantial proportions (range, 24%-45%) of unvaccinated or undervaccinated individuals. However, several pertussis outbreaks also occurred in highly vaccinated populations, indicating waning immunity. Nine reports (describing 12 outbreaks) provided detailed vaccination data on unimmunized cases; among 8 of these outbreaks from 59% through 93% of unvaccinated individuals were intentionally unvaccinated. \n \n Conclusions and Relevance A substantial proportion of the US measles cases in the era after elimination were intentionally unvaccinated. The phenomenon of vaccine refusal was associated with an increased risk for measles among people who refuse vaccines and among fully vaccinated individuals. Although pertussis resurgence has been attributed to waning immunity and other factors, vaccine refusal was still associated with an increased risk for pertussis in some populations.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Wondering what's behind recent outbreaks of measles and whooping cough in the US? Perhaps not surprisingly, a new study published in JAMA finds that people who don't vaccinate\u2014for non-medical reasons\u2014contribute to the problem, Reuters reports. Since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, there have been 1,416 cases of the disease reported, and the study finds that more than half of those cases were in people who hadn't been vaccinated for measles. Detailed vaccination data was available for 970 of the measles cases, and 405 of them involved people who skipped vaccinations without a medical reason to do so. Researchers also looked at more than 10,000 cases of whooping cough in patients with known vaccination status and found similar, though somewhat less dramatic, results. In the pertussis cases, when looking at the five biggest statewide epidemics since 1977, 24% to 45% of the people affected were completely or partially unvaccinated. And in looking at the pertussis cases for which detailed vaccine data was available, 59% to 93% of cases were in people who were intentionally unvaccinated (as opposed to unvaccinated for medical reasons.) \u201cIf there are a high number of susceptible or unvaccinated individuals in the community the risk of getting infected\u2014even for vaccinated children\u2014goes up,\" says the study's senior author, because most vaccines are not 100% effective. Up to 2% of people who are fully vaccinated for pertussis and 3% of people who are fully vaccinated for measles are still at risk of getting the disease. Non-medical vaccine exemptions don't fully explain the resurgence of measles and whooping cough (researchers also found evidence of waning immunity against pertussis, for example), but another researcher says the study finds that \"individuals who refuse vaccines not only put themselves at risk for disease,\" but others too."

John Hickenlooper also credited security procedures adopted after the 1999 massacre at nearby Columbine High School for helping put a quick end to the Arapahoe High School shooting by Karl Pierson, an 18-year-old student who shot Claire Davis at point-blank range before killing himself. \n \n \"We all have to keep Claire in our thoughts and prayers,\" he told CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" Davis is hospitalized at Littleton Adventist Hospital. \n \n Davis is in critical condition and stable, but she is in a coma, her family said in a statement issued on the hospital's Facebook page Sunday. \n \n \"The first responders got Claire to the right place, at the right time,\" the family said. They also praised the care she was receiving and expressed thanks for the outpouring of prayers and support. \n \n About 500 classmates held a candlelight vigil Saturday for Davis, who was sitting with a friend near the school library when she was shot in the head. Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson has said investigators think she was shot at random by Pierson, who had gone into the school looking for a teacher with whom he had a dispute. \n \n Pierson may have been nursing a grudge against the teacher _ a librarian and head of the school debate team _ since September. Pierson was on the team and had been disciplined by the librarian for reasons yet to be disclosed, the sheriff said. He said Pierson threatened that teacher in September and came to the school Friday intending to harm him and inflict numerous other casualties. \n \n Pierson excelled at speech and debate and was passionate about the team, friends said. They described him as a smart student who apparently didn't shirk from confrontations in class. \n \n \"He's a funny kid. He's smart. He's in the Eagle Scouts, a very intelligent kid. Did not like being wrong,\" said August Clary, who was a friend of Pierson. \"If you're arguing with him, it's going to be, that's a feat if you win an argument against him.\" \n \n \"He would not be afraid to tell someone how he feels,\" said Zach Runberg, 18, a senior in Pierson's English class. \n \n Pierson legally bought a shotgun on Dec. 6 at a local store, and he purchased ammunition the morning of the shootings. He managed to ignite a Molotov cocktail inside the school library before he killed himself as a fast-acting school security officer, a deputy sheriff, closed in, Robinson said. \n \n That officer's aggressive response prevented more casualties, Robinson said. It's a tactic adopted nationwide after Columbine, in which first responders cordoned off the school before pursuing two student gunmen inside. The two killed 12 students and a teacher before killing themselves. \n \n \"It's nice to see how well the system worked. It's a remarkable improvement from before. This could have been much, much worse,\" Hickenlooper said. \n \n After the Aurora, Colo., theater shootings and the Newtown, Conn., school shootings, Colorado's Democrat-led legislature this year implemented gun control measures that limited the size of ammunition magazines and instituted universal background checks. Colorado also appropriated more than $20 million for mental health hotlines and local crisis centers. \n \n The measures were intended to address violence associated with so-called assault rifles, not shotguns that are widely owned for hunting and sport. \n \n Hickenlooper acknowledged the latest shooting raised again questions about guns and violence. But he noted that Pierson \"didn't seem to exhibit any signs of mental illness,\" and he cautioned that the investigation was in its early stages. \n \n \"Everyone in Colorado is asking the same questions,\" the governor said. \"On the one hand there is a deeply held conviction for the freedoms laid out in the Second Amendment, but also a very, very strong conviction about the safety of children and the safety of the community.\" \n \n Friday's shooting, he said, \"defies any explanation, and you know we are searching for some pattern.\" \n \n __ \n \n Associated Press writer P. Solomon Banda contributed to this report. ||||| Students at Arapahoe High School should have been studying for finals Monday, powering through their last week of classes before Christmas break. \n \n Instead, authorities continue to walk the school's hallways, piecing together the 80 seconds that terrified a community and left Claire Davis in a coma, fighting for her life. \n \n Davis remained in critical condition Sunday evening, according to a statement from her family, who praised first responders and asked the community to continue thinking of and praying for the 17-year-old. \n \n Claire Davis (Provided by Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office) \n \n The senior was shot point-blank in the head Friday after she found herself in the path of Karl Pierson, who had fired several random rounds in the hallway before he shot Davis. Pierson, an 18-year-old senior, stormed into the school at about 12:30 p.m., carrying a pump-action shotgun, a bandolier of ammunition, a machete and three Molotov cocktails. \n \n Seconds later, Pierson turned the gun on himself. Officers found his body in a corner of the library. \n \n Advertisement \n \n Pierson bought the shotgun days before, part of a plot to avenge a grudge he had against the school's librarian and debate coach, Tracy Murphy. Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson told The Post on Sunday that investigators have spoken with Murphy extensively and are working to understand the relationship between the two. \n \n \"We're beginning to better define that, but at this point in time it's not something we're going to talk about,\" Robinson said. \n \n Robinson and Gov. John Hickenlooper have credited the swift response by a deputy sheriff working as the school's resource officer during the shooting. \n \n \"This could have been much, much worse,\" Hickenlooper told CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \n \n Hickenlooper also visited Davis and her family Sunday. \n \n \"We all have to keep Claire in our thoughts and prayers,\" he said. \n \n More than 1,000 of Davis' classmates and other community members gathered at the high school's track Sunday to pray for and support Davis. The crowd, huddled together in black and gold, came to offer prayers, give hugs and try to understand why. \n \n \"It helps to see everyone's faces, to give them hugs,\" 14-year-old freshman Nick Atencio said. \"It still has all of us reeling. It's important that we all come together.\" \n \n Students stood in groups, and when words failed, hugs were used instead. Parents also came together, holding back tears as they described the short, terrifying text messages their children sent them from inside dark, quiet classrooms. \n \n For many parents, the messages that were sent to reassure them \u2014 \"I'm OK,\" \"We're hiding and waiting,\" \"I love you\" \u2014 turned into rattling uncertainty. \n \n \"It's going to be hard when we have to go back in there,\" Atencio said, staring at the entrance Pierson used Friday. \"I don't know what to expect. But it's a step we're all going to have to take together.\" \n \n Balloons and well-wishes for shooting victim Claire Davis, 17, are attached to a fence along Dry Creek Road near Arapahoe High School on Sunday. \n \n School officials are working to set up times when students may come and collect their belongings. \n \n But the trauma of Friday's shooting will reverberate long past when students return to school and beyond the school's walls, said Dr. David Schonfeld, director of the National Center for School Crisis and Bereavement in Philadelphia. Schonfeld traveled to Colorado to work with students after the 2006 shooting at Platte Canyon High School, during which 16-year-old Emily Keyes was killed, and the shootings at the Aurora movie theater, where a gunman killed 12 people and injured 70 others in July 2012. \n \n Less than an hour's drive to the movie theater and just miles from Columbine High School, where two students killed 12 students and one teacher in 1999, the shooting at Arapahoe High School is likely to spark memories of trauma for those affected by past events. The emotional toll also may cause overwhelming feelings of grief for members of the community, Schonfeld said. \n \n Students and staff members who were at the school Friday will experience a range of emotions, Schonfeld said. Many may begin to place blame on themselves, either for failing to stop the shooting or predict it. \n \n \"Whenever anything bad happens, people feel badly. But they also wonder what they did that was bad,\" Schonfeld said. \"A lot of this comes from the sense that people would rather accept blame for what happened than to realize it's completely out of their control.\" \n \n The Littleton Public School District has made counseling available for students. \n \n On Sunday, students worked to comfort each other, including Davis. \n \n Students hung a Christmas stocking for Davis and left notes at the tribute forming along the school's south fence. Their message \u2014 and hope \u2014 could be seen a block away. \n \n \"Pray for Claire.\" \n \n Jordan Steffen: 303-954-1794, jsteffen@denverpost.com or twitter.com/jsteffendp \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report. ||||| NBC News Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson holds a picture of Claire Davis the 17-year-old student that was shot during a briefing Saturday, Dec. 14, 2013, at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo. \n \n The 17-year-old girl shot point-blank in the head at a Colorado high school \u2014 who is being described as \"one of the nicest people\" \u2014 is in a coma and in critical condition, her family said Sunday. \n \n Claire Esther Davis, a senior at Arapahoe High School in Centennial, Colo., was wounded Friday in an 80-second attack by student gunman Karl Halverson Pierson, 18, who walked in the building packing a shotgun and a grudge over being benched on the debate team, police said. \n \n The victim's family had previously said she suffered severe head trauma, but provided more details on her condition Sunday and thanked emergency workers who rushed her to the hospital. \n \n \"Claire remains in critical condition. She is stable, but is in a coma,\" they said in a statement released through Littleton Adventist Hospital. \n \n \"The first responders got Claire to the right place, at the right time, and the doctors and hospital staff are doing a wonderful job taking care of her. \n \n \"We appreciate your continued good thoughts and prayers, and will provide updates as her condition improves.\" \n \n Arapahoe County Sheriff Grayson Robinson said Claire was just in the wrong place at the wrong time and that the motive for the shooting was retaliation against a staff member. \n \n Karl Pierson had grown angry and made threatening remarks before he shot a student and himself in a Colorado high school. NBC's Ron Mott reports. \n \n Debate team captain Joe Redmond said Pierson had grown angrier and angrier in recent weeks, and the target of his ire was debate coach and school librarian Tracy Murphy. \n \n \"Speech and debate was his life and the fact that he wasn't there crushed him a little bit and made him really tense and angry,\" Redmond told NBC News. \n \n \"Karl and Murphy did not get along and whatever it was escalated to a death threat. \n \n \"I did try to help him and didn't get to him,\" Redmond added. \"No one was able to get to him. At the end of the day, that\u2019s what happened.\" \n \n Pierson showed up at school at midday Friday with a pump-action shotgun, ammunition strapped to his chest, a machete and Molotov cocktails \u2014 and headed for the library. \n \n Alerted to the threat, Murphy left the building, which police praised as a tactical move to lure Pierson outside. \n \n Pierson fired one round down a hallway and then shot Claire, who just happened to be sitting nearby with a friend. He killed himself as a security officer closed in on him, police said. \n \n \"His intent was evil and his evil intent was to harm multiple individuals,\" the sheriff said. \n \n Redmond said he was trying to reconcile the cold-blooded crime with the teenager he knew. \n \n \"It's indefensible what he did,\" he said. \n \n \"The Karl that I knew was a good person but obviously the Karl who came into the school on Friday was not.\" \n \n Murphy was not hurt. A statement from the Littleton Public Schools he had \"asked asked that we share his and his family's concern for all of the victims of this tragedy.\" \n \n Meanwhile, Arapahoe students are praying for Claire, who was described as outgoing, athletic and an excellent student. She loves horses and recently placed second in an equestrian competition, The Denver Post reported, \n \n A neighbor told the newspaper Claire is also the best babysitter in the community. \n \n \"She took care of our 5-year-old,\" said one man. \"She was well-loved. I believe she wanted to go into nursing \u2014 I know she had already been accepted to a number of colleges already.\" \n \n Fellow student Avery Griggs, a sophomore, said she is \"one of the nicest people I've met at Arapahoe.\" \n \n \"She is amazing and so sweet,\" Avery told the Post. \n \n Friends and well-wishers posted prayers on Twitter, and some students collected money to help pay for her medical expenses. \n \n \"I feel like it's going to make us a stronger senior class and school as a whole,\" Chris Davis, an Arapahoe senior who helped organize the fundraising effort. \n \n This story was originally published on",

    "input": "CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt's main opposition coalition will not join a national dialogue on Monday called by President Mohamed Mursi because the proposal was not genuine and the group will only attend future talks if a list of conditions are met, members said. \n \n Mursi invited his allies and rivals to talks at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) on Monday to try to resolve a political crisis and end violence on the streets that erupted during anti-government protests. Five days of unrest has led to 50 deaths. \n \n The National Salvation Front, which rejected a similar call for dialogue last year during another spasm of unrest, saw the Islamist leader's call as \"cosmetic and not substantive\", said leading member of the coalition Mohamed ElBaradei. \n \n \"We will not go to the dialogue today,\" ElBaradei told a news conference after the Front's members met in Cairo to discuss the invitation. \n \n \"We will send a message to the Egyptian people and the president of the republic about what we think are the essentials for dialogue. If he agrees to them, we are ready for dialogue.\" \n \n The coalition's conditions included a demand that Mursi accept responsibility for the bloodshed and agree to form a government of national salvation, echoing previously unmet demands by the opposition. \n \n \"We have accepted dialogue (in the past) and went to the president in his office and spoke to him,\" said leftist firebrand politician Hamdeen Sabahy. \"We did not refuse dialogue. But the result was he issued an oppressive decree.\" \n \n Opposition politicians were enraged late last year when Mursi issued a decree awarding himself extra powers that the president's allies said were essential to help push Egypt's transition forward. Rivals saw it as a blatant power grab. \n \n Opposition politicians were particularly angered that they had not been given any indication of Mursi's plans for such a sweeping move in their individual talks with him shortly before the decree was issued. \n \n After that decree, Mursi fast-tracked an Islamist-tinged constitution through a referendum, further enraging his opponents who accused him of reneging on his pledged to be a president for all Egyptians. \n \n (Reporting by Shaimaa Fayed and Omar Fahmy; Writing by Edmund Blair; Editing by Alison Williams) ||||| 8.46am GMT \n \n Welcome to Middle East Live. \n \n Here's a roundup of the latest developments: \n \n Egypt \n \n \u2022 President Mohamed Morsi has announced a state of emergency in three cities along Egypt's Suez Canal, following four days of civil unrest that have left at least 40 dead and over 500 injured. Port Said, Suez, and Ismailiya \u2013 the cities most affected by the violence \u2013 will be subject to a 30-day curfew lasting from 9pm to 6am every night, Morsi said in a surprise televised speech. Speaking to the Guardian, a spokesman for the opposition expressed frustration at the announcement, blaming the president's policies and inaction for the violence, and arguing that the state of emergency was too little, too late. \n \n \u2022 Morsi also invited his opponents for a national dialogue meeting on Monday aimed at quelling the unrest. His officer said it was inviting leading politicians such as former presidential candidates Hamdeen Sabahy and Amr Moussa. \n \n \u2022 The opposition has threatened to back further protests unless Morsi meets five new demands including reforms to the constitution and the formation of a new salvation government, Ahram Online reports. The National Salvation Front stressed that if their \u201clegitimate\u201d demands were not met in the coming days, the front would call on Egyptians to peacefully protest next Friday to topple the \u201cinvalid\u201d constitution and to readopt temporarily the 1971 constitution. \n \n \u2022 Has Egypt become ungovernable? asks the latest Arabist podcast. Journalist Ursula Lindsey says there is now no respect for the country's institutions, including the courts, as many turn to violence to influence decisions. \n \n \u2022 At least 25 women have been sexually assaulted during the recent unrest in Cairo's Tahrir Square, according to local women's rights campaigners. In a typical attack, crowds of men quickly surround isolated women, groping them and attempting to remove their clothes. Some women have been stripped naked and one was raped, the campaigners said. \n \n Syria \n \n \u2022 Barack Obama has defended his decision not to intervene in Syria by suggesting that to do so would provoke further violence. Speaking to New Republic magazine, the US president said: \"In a situation like Syria, I have to ask: can we make a difference in that situation? Could it trigger even worse violence or the use of chemical weapons? What offers the best prospect of a stable post-Assad regime? And how do I weigh tens of thousands who've been killed in Syria versus the tens of thousands who are currently being killed in the Congo?\" In a separate interview with CBS he added: \"We do nobody a service when we leap before we look, where we ... take on things without having thought through all the consequences of it ... sometimes that we don't just shoot from the hip.\" \n \n \u2022 The Russian prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev, has said Bashar al-Assad's chances of retaining power in Syria are getting \"smaller and smaller\" every day, according to the transcript of an interview with CNN. \"I think that with every day, every week and every month the chances of his preservation are getting smaller and smaller,\" Medvedev was quoted as saying. \n \n Israel and the Palestinian territories \n \n \u2022 At least five unarmed young Palestinians, including a 21-year-old woman, have been shot dead by Israeli soldiers in 13 days since the start of the year, prompting mounting concern about the unwarranted use of live fire. A sixth was killed on his 17th birthday last month, and a seventh death this month is disputed by the Israeli military. The commander of the Israeli Defence Forces in the West Bank, Brigadier-General Hagai Mordechai, has ordered all commanders to reiterate to all soldiers the rules of engagement, a military spokesman told the Guardian. \n \n Iran \n \n \u2022 Security officials have raided at least four newspapers and arrested several journalists in what appears to be concerted action aimed at intimidating the media in advance of the presidential elections in June. Sources in Tehran said reformist newspapers Etemaad, Shargh, Bahar and Arman were targeted by a group of plainclothes officials who ransacked offices, filmed staff, confiscated documents and held several journalists. ||||| PORT SAID, Egypt \u2014 The police fired indiscriminately into the streets outside their besieged station, a group of protesters arrived with a crate of gasoline bombs, and others cheered a masked man on a motorcycle who arrived with a Kalashnikov. \n \n The growing chaos along the vital canal zone showed little sign of abating on Monday as President Mohamed Morsi called out the army to try to regain control of three cities along the Suez Canal whose growing lawlessness is testing the integrity of the Egyptian state. \n \n In Port Said, street battles reached a bloody new peak with a death toll over three days of at least 45, with at least five more protesters killed by bullet wounds, hospital officials said. \n \n President Morsi had already declared a monthlong state of emergency here and in the other canal towns of Suez and Ismailia, applying a law that virtually eliminates due process protections against abuse by the police. Angry crowds burned tires and hurled rocks at the police. And the police, with little training and less credibility, hunkered down behind barrages of tear gas, birdshot and occasional bullets. ||||| Police have fired tear-gas at protesters in downtown Cairo, just hours after President Mohamed Morsi declared a state of emegency and a curfew in three Suez Canal cities. \n \n Monday was the fifth consecutive day of street violence in Egypt. There were reports that one person was killed; he was not taking part in the protests, but was hit by a stray gunshot. \n \n Protests began last week to mark the second anniversary of the revolution that toppled longtime president Hosni Mubarak; nearly 50 people have been killed so far. \n \n The cabinet, meanwhile, approved a draft law which would allow Morsi to deploy the army on the streets to \"participate with the police in preserving security and protecting vital establishments.\" The law still must be ratified by the upper house of parliament; it would last until after the next legislative elections, tentatively scheduled for April. \n \n Morsi delivered a televised address on Sunday night and announced the emergency measures in Port Said, Ismailia and Suez. A curfew will take effect on Monday from 9:00pm local time (19:00 GMT) to 6:00am (04:00 GMT); he warned that more action would be taken to stem the violence. \n \n \"I have said I am against any emergency measures but I have said that if I must stop bloodshed and protect the people then I will act,\" he said. \n \n He also called for dialogue with leading politicians starting on Monday to resolve the situation. \n \n Port Said deaths \n \n Seven people were shot dead and hundreds were injured in Port Said on Sunday during the funerals of at least 30 people killed during clashes in the city on the previous day. \n \n \"Down, down Morsi, down down the regime that killed and tortured us!\" people in Port Said chanted as the coffins of those killed on Saturday were carried through the streets. \n \n In Port Said, Al Jazeera's Rawya Rageh said military helicopters that had been overhead during the funeral could also be heard during Morsi's speech. \n \n \"I dont see how these decisions will instil any confidence in the people,\" Rageh said, referring to the president's decision to impose a state of emergency. \n \n She said that immediate reaction in Port Said was one of mockery and scepticism with many asking why the three canal cities had been singled out. \n \n \"The people [in Port Said] feel that there was a complete state of collapse especially after riots today, particularly with tear gas being fired into the funerals,\" she said. \n \n Protesters defiant \n \n Several hundred people protested in Ismailia, Suez and Port Said after the announcement. \n \n Activists in the three cities pledged to defy the curfew in protest at the decision. \n \n On Sunday night, Morsi\u2019s office issued a statement inviting political supporters and opponents for a national dialogue on Monday at 6:00pm (16:00 GMT) at the presidential palace in Cairo. \n \n The spokesman for Egypt's main opposition coalition said after Morsi's speech that the move was \"expected\" and said he wanted more details about an invitation for dialogue with top politicians. \n \n \"Of course we feel the president is missing the real problem on the ground which is his own policies,\" Dawoud told the Reuters news agency. \n \n \"His call to implement emergency law was an expected move given what is going on, namely thuggery and criminal actions.\" \n \n Hamdeen Sabbahi, a leftist politician and opposition leader, said that he would not attend any negotiations \"unless the bloodshed stops and the people's demands are met\". \n \n Mohamed ElBaradei, a leader of the NSF, said in a statement on Twitter that the dialogue was \"a waste of time\". \n \n Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch in Cairo said a state of emergency reintroduced laws that gave police sweeping powers of arrest \"purely because [people] look suspicious\". \n \n \"It is a classic knee-jerk reaction to think the emergency law will help bring security,\" she said. \"It gives so much discretion to the Ministry of Interior that it ends up causing more abuse which in turn causes more anger.\"",
    "reference": "\u2013 Despite President Mohamed Morsi declaring a state of emergency yesterday, protests are raging in Cairo and other parts of Egypt for a fifth consecutive day today, the New York Times reports. Marchers in Port Said, one of three provinces where Morsi declared a curfew, said they no longer recognize his authority and called on everyone to ignore the curfew. Opposition groups have called for more protests throughout Egypt today to mark the two-year anniversary of the \"Day of Rage,\" a brutal day of clashes during the uprising that ousted Hosni Mubarak. Protests began last week to mark the two-year anniversary of the uprising, then grew over the weekend after 21 people involved in a soccer riot were sentenced to death. In addition to the state of emergency, one of the most hated Mubarak-era laws still in effect, al-Jazeera reports that Egypt's Cabinet has given the army the right to arrest civilians and act alongside police; the upper house of parliament must still ratify the draft law. Morsi has invited opposition leaders to a \"national dialogue\" tonight, and initial reports indicated they would participate. But now the Guardian reports that the National Salvation Front, the country's opposition coalition, has rejected the plan. Leading member Mohamed ElBaradei called Morsi's offer \"cosmetic and not substantive,\" Reuters reports. The coalition has given a list of conditions Morsi must meet before they will enter into talks."

My paperwork came from the embassy. It's 100 per cent correct and it was approved by the South Sudan ambassador and the American ambassador.\u201d \n \n While in prison, Ms Ibrahim said she was abused and harassed by guards and other inmates over her faith, and visited by a series of different sheikhs trying to persuade her to convert. Meriam Ibrahim was later detained trying to flee Sudan \n \n Despite being brought up a Christian, a court in Sudan determined that she was actually a Muslim because her father was a Muslim. It therefore ruled it illegal for her to marry her Christian husband Daniel Wani under Sudanese laws. \n \n Meriam Ibrahim with her husband Daniel Wani US officials say diplomats are now trying to arrange for Ms Ibrahim and her family to depart from Sudan. \n \n Mr Wani, who holds American citizenship as well as being a citizen of South Sudan, said authorities accused his wife of forging the documents as a pretext to justify her detention \u201cwithout an arrest warrant\u201d. \n \n \u201cDoes it make sense that we try to fly all the way to the United States with forged passports?\u201d he said. They were arrested and detained for two days at Khartoum airport where the family was departing the country, a day after Sudan's Cassation Court overturned a death sentence against Ms Ibrahim and ordered her release. ||||| (CNN) -- What a week it's been for Mariam Yehya Ibrahim, the Sudanese Christian woman who initially faced a death sentence after refusing to renounce her faith. \n \n She thought she was finally free Monday after a higher court ordered her release. A day later, she was back in police custody. \n \n Now she faces a new charge, accused of falsifying travel documents, and has taken refuge in a safe house in Sudan's capital, Khartoum, amid concerns for her security. \n \n In a phone interview with CNN, Ibrahim spoke of the ordeal of giving birth while in prison, her fears for her family and how she is facing a future full of unknowns. \n \n Asked how she felt in prison, refused access to a hospital as the birth of her child neared, Ibrahim said, \"I was only thinking about my children and how I was going to give birth. I was mostly scared of giving birth in prison.\" \n \n The 27-year-old had reason to be alarmed. \n \n \"I gave birth chained. Not cuffs but chains on my legs. I couldn't open my legs so the women had to lift me off the table. I wasn't attached to the table,\" she said. \n \n Doctors fear that the circumstances of the baby's birth may have lasting consequences. \n \n \"I don't know in the future whether she'll need support to walk or not,\" said Ibrahim. \n \n She her husband, American Daniel Wani, were freed from custody Thursday after having been detained two days earlier upon arriving at the airport in Khartoum. They were trying to fly with their baby and toddler son to the United States. \n \n Now they are waiting to see what happens in light of the latest allegations against Ibrahim, of traveling with falsified documents and giving false information. \n \n \"I'm currently in a safe place. It's definitely safe but not comfortable,\" Ibrahim said. \n \n Sudanese Christian woman is in U.S. Embassy in Sudan \n \n Persecuted as a 'nonbeliever' \n \n Ibrahim's ordeal started when one of her relatives, a Muslim, filed a criminal complaint saying her family was shocked to find out she had married Wani, a Christian, after she was missing for several years. \n \n A Sudanese court considered Ibrahim a Muslim because her father was Muslim. She was charged with adultery, because a Muslim woman's marriage to a Christian man is illegal in Sudan. She was also charged with apostasy, accused of illegally renouncing what was alleged to be her original faith. \n \n Convicted while about eight months pregnant, she gave birth about two weeks later in a women's hospital in Khartoum. \n \n She insists she has never been a Muslim -- and says she was persecuted as a Christian while in prison. \n \n \"I've always been Christian. I couldn't have been Muslim with the things they say and the way they treat me -- with a different sheikh coming to speak to me every other time and women in prison saying all sorts of things, like 'don't eat the nonbeliever's food' and calling me a Christian,\" she said. \"There was all this talk and even the officers in the prison would join (in).\" \n \n A string of people, from politicians to humanitarian workers to lawmakers, came to visit while she was locked up with promises to help, she said, but none offered any real assistance. Eventually, following weeks of international controversy over her conviction for apostasy and adultery, it was overturned. \n \n Ibrahim: My paperwork was '100% correct' \n \n Now, the Sudanese authorities have accused Ibrahim of trying to leave without the correct paperwork. Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Services said that she had South Sudanese travel documents despite not being a citizen of South Sudan, and she was heading to the United States, which is not her native country. \n \n But she is adamant that she \"never forged any papers\" and was entitled to travel on the documents she had. \n \n \"How can my paperwork be wrong? My paperwork came from the embassy. It's 100% correct and it was approved by the South Sudan ambassador and the American ambassador,\" she said. \n \n \"The South Sudanese embassy took responsibility and released the papers. It's in my right to use the papers and have a South Sudanese passport because my husband is a South Sudanese citizen. He has an American passport and South Sudanese passport.\" \n \n Ibrahim had also been given a U.S. visa. \n \n She described as \"terrorizing\" the way that Sudanese police officers took her and her husband, who uses a wheelchair, from the VIP departures hall as they waited to check in for their flight. \n \n \"We were scared and wondering what was wrong. They locked us in that room for four to five hours and the whole time we were trying to figure out what the problem was,\" she said. \n \n She claims that the charges were filed in court before the police even investigated the claims against her and her husband. When they finally figured out what the alleged offense was, she was shocked, Ibrahim said. \n \n \"I can't even decide what I should do right now. I want to travel but at the same time I don't want to travel. But the state I'm in right now means that I'm forced to. There's a new problem every day about me leaving.\" \n \n Asked if the authorities were trying to make life difficult for her, Ibrahim replied, \"I don't know what their problem is.\" \n \n Faith in her husband \n \n Ibrahim simply hopes that she can leave, together with her husband and their children. \n \n \"That's exactly what I want. Not anything more,\" she said. \n \n But despite her experiences so far, she insists that she is not scared.

Asked if she was scared something would happen to the baby during the delivery, she replied: \"Something has happened to the baby \u2026 I don't know in the future whether she'll need support to walk or not.\" \n \n Describing how she felt when she was sentenced to death, Ibrahim said: \"I was only thinking about my children and how I was going to give birth. I was really scared of giving birth in prison.\" \n \n Ibrahim spoke by phone to CNN from what she described as a safe place \u2013 the US embassy in Khartoum \u2013 following her detention at the city's airport two days after her convictions for apostasy and adultery were quashed and she was released from prison. \n \n \"To be honest, I'm really miserable. I left prison to bring together my children and settle down \u2026 and now there are protests against me in the streets,\" she said. \n \n Ibrahim, her husband, Daniel Wani, who is a US citizen, and their two children were waiting to check in for a flight when they were stopped by 10 to 15 security officers, she said. \n \n \"We were scared and wondering what was wrong. They locked us in that room for four to five hours and the whole time we were trying to figure out what the problem was,\" she said. \n \n When the officials, who told Ibrahim they were from the National Intelligence and Security Service, questioned the couple, \"we realised that the problem was our travel documents\". \n \n Ibrahim was accused of possessing forged travel documents, although South Sudan said it had issued the papers. \n \n \"It's my right to use the papers and have a South Sudanese passport because my husband is a South Sudanese citizen. He has an American passport and South Sudanese passport,\" she said. \"I never forged any papers. I was given the papers by the South Sudanese embassy because I deserve it. It's my right to have papers like these because my husband is South Sudanese.\" \n \n She appeared unclear about her intentions. \"I can't even decide what I should do right now. I want to travel but at the same time I don't want to travel \u2026 There's a new problem every day about me leaving.\" \n \n Her lawyer, Elshareef Mohammed, earlier said the family were boarding a plane to the US when they were detained. \n \n Ibrahim, the daughter of a Muslim man and a Christian woman, was convicted of apostasy despite insisting to the court that she had been brought up as a Christian since her father left the family when she was six. Her marriage to Wani was declared invalid and she was convicted of adultery and sentenced to 100 lashes. \n \n Her convictions, sentences and detention in Omdurman's women's prison while heavily pregnant and with her toddler son incarcerated alongside her caused international outrage. More than a million people backed an Amnesty International campaign to get her released. \n \n \"I've always been Christian,\" she told CNN. \"I couldn't have been Muslim and not go back, with all the things they said and the way they treat me \u2013 with a different sheikh coming to speak to me every other time and women in prison saying all sorts of things like 'don't eat the nonbeliever's food' and calling me a Christian. There was all this talk and taunts. Even the officers in the prison would join in.\"",

    "input": "A systematic sampling of the complete arthropod fauna in the interior of homes and an understanding of the role that interior microhabitats play in determining the assemblage of arthropod communities are the first steps toward revealing ecological dynamics in a vastly understudied system ( Baz & Monserrat, 1999 ; Dunn et al., 2013 ). What are the most prevalent arthropod groups found in houses and how common are they among homes and rooms? Here we explored the composition of overall arthropod diversity, including both pest and non-pest species, in human dwellings. Through surveying 50 free-standing houses located in the North Carolina Piedmont region, we identified and characterized the overall diversity of arthropods found within these homes. \n \n Research on indoor arthropod communities has focused almost exclusively on pests, with a particular emphasis on those of medical and economic importance such as cockroaches, termites, bed bugs, fleas, and mosquitoes ( Committee on Urban Pest Management et al., 1980 ; Robinson, 2005 ). Unlike the species that threaten or bother us, very little is known about the myriad other arthropod species, many of them inconspicuous (and even unnoticed), that live with humans. The true interactions between these other species and humans\u2014be it beneficial, neutral, or negative\u2014remain largely unknown, as does their prevalence and distribution. In fact, a comprehensive survey of arthropod life in contemporary human houses has never before been carried out. \n \n In contrast to the simple dwellings early humans used, modern western houses are perceived of as being an environment largely devoid of animal life. However, arthropods thrive in homes, as evidenced by today\u2019s multi-billion dollar pest control industry. Houses today host many of the same pest groups found in archeological sites (see \u2018Results\u2019), yet today\u2019s arthropod communities also reflect aspects of society\u2019s modernization. For example, with the advent of indoor plumbing, dung beetles (Scarabaeidae) are less prevalent indoors (as shown in this study), but drain-dwelling moth flies (Psychodidae) are likely more so. Also, as human society became more globalized through travel and trade, arthropod species that are closely associated with humans and their homes, such as the house fly ( Musca domestica L.; Legner & McCoy, 1966 ), German cockroach ( Blattella germanica L.), and fruit fly (or vinegar fly, Drosophila melanogaster Meigen; Keller, 2007 ) obtained worldwide distributions and, in some cases, even lack wild populations (e.g., the German cockroach; Roth, 1985 ; Booth et al., 2010 ). The influence of human society and our changing domiciles on the evolution of specific arthropod lineages is evident. \n \n Insects, spiders and their relatives have been living and evolving with humans for all of our history. It has been proposed that many arthropod species that are now associated with human houses were originally cave dwellers (e.g., bed bugs: Cimicidae) ( Balv\u00edn et al., 2012 ). Evidence of arthropod vectors in caves inhabited by prehistoric people ca. 26,000 years ago suggests that pestiferous arthropods, such as blood-feeding kissing bugs (Reduviidae: Triatominae), lived alongside our ancestors ( Ara\u00fajo et al., 2009 ). Among the first examples of cave art is a depiction of a camel cricket (Rhaphidophoridae) ( Chopard, 1928 ; Belles, 1997 ). \n \n For as long as humans have lived in fixed habitations there have been other organisms that dwell alongside us. We share our living spaces with a variety of invited and uninvited guests spanning the tree of life, from large vertebrates (e.g., pets and livestock) to microorganisms ( Martin et al., 2015 ). The most diverse and abundant group of multicellular life found in homes, as well as on Earth more generally, is represented by arthropods. \n \n We classified rooms into 6 categories based on their similarities of features and use: attics, basements (including finished and unfinished basements, and crawl spaces), bathrooms (including bathrooms and laundry rooms), bedrooms (including bedrooms, offices, and libraries), common rooms (including living rooms, dining rooms, and attached hallways), and kitchens (including kitchens and pantries); rooms not conforming to one of the categories were classified as \u201cother\u201d and were excluded from Table 1 . We estimated diversity of families based on the complete list of families acquired over each sampled house using the Chao2 Estimator with 1,000 randomization runs in EstimateS ( Colwell, 2013 ). We compared total dust mite abundance in each sample with the floor type on which it was collected. Some samples were collected on carpet, while others were on bare surfaces. Because the data were not normally distributed, we analyzed the differences between samples with different floor types using a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test. All analyses were done in R 3.1.2 ( R Core Team, 2015 ). \n \n We identified all specimens to family level except when specimens were badly damaged or required additional methods for identification (e.g., slide mounting of mites and other taxa). We further determined genera and species when possible, but many specimens could not be identified to such a level for several reasons including, but not limited to, being damaged, being an unidentifiable sex (e.g., female Sciaridae) or an unidentifiable life stage (e.g., larvae), or being a group that is understudied or lacking good diagnostic keys. As such, our approach produced a very conservative list of morphotaxa for each room in the house and hereafter we call these morphospecies; this type of characterization has been found to be effective in comparing species richness and turnover between sites ( Oliver & Beattie, 2002 ). The taxonomic identity of morphospecies was not compared between rooms within homes due to limitations on time, space (storage of voucher specimens) and diagnostic expertise, thus the true number of morphospecies per house and among all houses was not definitively determined. Thus, a conservative (or assumed minimum) estimate of morphospecies richness per house was created by taking the maximum number of morphospecies from the room containing the highest number of morphospecies, for each family, and summing the total. This is in contrast to a maximum estimate of morphospecies richness which was the total sum of all morphospecies from all rooms within a house; this maximum corresponds to the case in which no two rooms held the same morphospecies. We assume the true diversity falls between our minimum and maximum estimates. All voucher specimens are housed in vials of ethanol in the laboratory of RRD (Department of Biological Sciences, NCSU) for use in further ecological, genetic, and microbiological studies. Specimens will be deposited in the insect museum at NCSU (Department of Entomology) when permanently housed. \n \n We sampled dust mites from the middle of the master bedroom floor, regardless of floor type, in a 0.5 m 2 area. To collect mites, we used a vacuum that was adapted to use specimen cups modified with a screen bottom composed of mesh with 0.0055 inch (0.1397 mm) openings, small enough to allow air to pass through but not mites. We stored all samples in 95% ethanol until they were sorted and quantified. Because of time and specimen handling constraints, only five individuals from five randomly-selected samples were identified. \n \n We (trained entomologists) performed a visual inspection of each room and collected specimens by hand using forceps, aspirators and entomological nets. Only visible surfaces, including those accessible under and behind furniture, around baseboards, ceilings, and on shelves and other surfaces were sampled. We collected all arthropods or putative arthropods, including those from spider webs; both living and dead arthropods were collected in this manner into vials containing 95% ethanol. We did not collect all specimens of a given arthropod species. We designated each distinct room or area and labeled its vial with the room name (as best identified), floor type, and number of windows and doors to the outside of the house; doors between rooms were not quantified. We identified floor types as wood (including laminates, hardwoods, and other wood-like surfaces), linoleum (tiles or otherwise), tile (stone, concrete, or otherwise; not including linoleum) or carpet. The presence of small or large rugs on other surfaces was noted as well. Typical room categories included kitchens, bedrooms (sometimes specified as offices/dens because of their lack of running water, but not receiving the same amount of traffic as common areas), bathrooms, laundry/utility rooms (denoted when a washer and dryer were present), and common areas. Common areas consisted of large open areas that were not easily categorized, usually including dining rooms, living rooms, front rooms, hallways, etc. Closets were sampled and included with the room in which they opened. When a room was present on a floor other than the first/main floor, house level was recorded (e.g., \u201c2nd Floor Bathroom\u201d). All rooms inside the house were sampled in the manner described above except for attics and crawl spaces, which were sampled less thoroughly: only the entrance of each was sampled within a 2 m radius. The limited sampling method for these areas was deemed necessary for the safety of those collecting the specimens (i.e., to avoid high summer temperatures in attics and confined areas in crawl spaces). Screened porches, decks, garages, detached sheds/structures, and closets accessible only from the outside were not sampled. \n \n We solicited volunteers owning or renting free-standing homes in Raleigh and neighboring areas of North Carolina, USA. The study area is located in the Piedmont of the state and characterized by red clay soils and deciduous/pine forests (with meadows and aquatic/semi-aquatic systems interspersed) among various urban and suburban development ( Fig. 1 ). We randomly selected 50 homes/volunteers to visit from among participants who filled out an online questionnaire about the characteristics of their household and behavior of its residents. All homes included in the study were within a 30 mile radius of Raleigh\u2019s center (35.7719\u00b0N, 78.6389\u00b0W). Each home was visited once between May and October 2012. Upon arrival, volunteers were informed of the procedures and process for sampling arthropods and asked to sign a consent form ( Supplemental Information 1 ). \n \n Arthropods were found on every level of the home and in all room types. Only 5 rooms (non-attics) had no arthropod specimens collected (four bathrooms, one bedroom). Six arthropod orders dominated houses, comprising 81% of the diversity in an average room: Diptera (true flies, 23%), Coleoptera (beetles, 19%), Araneae (spiders, 16%), Hymenoptera (predominantly ants, 15%), Psocodea (book lice, 4%), and Hemiptera (true bugs, 4%) ( Fig. 5 ). Eight additional orders made up another 15% of the diversity (Blattodea, Collembola, Lepidoptera, Isopoda, Zygentoma, Polydesmida, Orthoptera, and Acari), while all remaining orders comprised a total of 4% of the overall diversity ( Fig. 5 ). The percentage of rooms in which an arthropod was collected varied among taxa, as did their presence in rooms of different types ( Table 1 ). \n \n Typical household pests were found in a minority of the homes, such as German cockroaches ( Blattella germanica : 6% of houses), subterranean termites (Rhinotermitidae: 28% of houses), and fleas (Pulicidae: 10% of houses); bed bugs ( Cimex lectularius Linnaeus) were not found during the study. Larger cockroaches (Blattidae), such as smoky brown ( Periplaneta fuliginosa (Serville)) and American cockroaches ( Periplaneta americana (Linnaeus)) were found in the majority of houses (74%). However, the American cockroach (which is the only of the two considered a true pest) was only recovered from three homes; smoky brown cockroaches made up the vast majority of large cockroaches collected. All pest species were less common than other more inconspicuous arthropods such as pillbugs (Armadillidiidae, 78%) and springtails (Entomobryidae, 78%). \n \n While overall diversity was high, 12 frequently found families were identified in at least 80% of homes ( Fig. 4 ). Only four families were identified from 100% of houses sampled: cobweb spiders (Theridiidae), carpet beetles (Dermestidae), gall midge flies (Cecidomyiidae) and ants (Formicidae). Book lice (Liposcelididae) and dark-winged fungus gnats (Sciaridae) were found in 98% and 96% of homes, respectively. Nearly half of all families (five of 12) found in over 80% of homes were true flies (Diptera): fungus gnats (Sciaridae); mosquitoes (Culicidae); scuttle flies (Phoridae); non-biting midges (Chironomidae); and gall midges (Cecidomyiidae). \n \n Twelve (12) families were represented in at least 80% of homes. For each family we present the common name and percentage of homes it was found in, followed in parentheses by the scientific family name and species level identification when possible. (A) cobweb spiders, 100% (Theridiidae; shown here Parasteatoda tepidariorum (Koch)); (B) carpet beetles, 100%, (Dermestidae; shown here Anthrenus larvae); (C) gall midges, 100% (Cecidomyiidae); (D) ants, 100% (Formicidae; shown here Monomorium minimum (Buckley)); (E) book lice, 98% (Liposcelididae); (F) dark-winged fungus gnats, 96% (Sciaridae); (G) cellar spiders, 84% (Pholcidae; shown here Pholcus sp.); (H) weevils, 82% (Curculionidae; shown here Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky)); (I) mosquitoes, 82% (Culicidae; shown here Aedes albopictus (Skuse)); (J) scuttle flies, 82% (Phoridae; shown here Dohrniphora incisuralis (Loew)); (K) leafhoppers, 82% (Cicadellidae; shown here Sibovia sp.); (L) non-biting midges, 80% (Chironomidae). All photos by MAB. \n \n The number of species collected by house is represented by the middle bar. The bottom limit is the minimum/conservative estimate of morphospecies by house which was calculated by taking the maximum number of morphospecies from the room containing the highest number of morphospecies, for each family, and summing the total The upper limit is the maximum possible of morphospecies within a house, with the assumption that each set of morphospecies within each room were unique from other rooms. Houses furthest to the left are the smallest in terms of square footage, and those furthest to the right are the largest. Houses ranged in size from 840 to 4,833 square feet. \n \n We collected 24\u2013128 families from each house, resulting in an average of 61.84 (s.d. = 23.24) distinct arthropod families per house and a total gamma diversity (across houses) of 304 families ( Fig. 2 ). One hundred and forty-nine (149) families were rare, collected from fewer than 10% of homes, 66 of which were found in just a single home. The number of families collected in a home was correlated with house size ( r 2 = 0.3, p = < 0.001). Conservative species estimates by home ranged from 32 to 211, with an average of 93.14 (s.d. = 42.34) morphospecies per house ( Fig. 3 ). Considering that our conservative species estimate assumes that rooms with the greatest number of morphospecies by family included all species from other rooms (which is almost certainly untrue), this number is likely much lower than the true number of species per house ( Fig. 3 ). \n \n Houses in the study ranged from 840 to 4,833 square feet in area (mean = 2,072; median = 1,720) and were from seven to 94 years old (mean = 41.35; median = 30.5). During the course of sampling 554 rooms in the 50 homes, over 10,000 specimens were collected and identified. These specimens represented all four subphyla (Chelicerata, Myriapoda, \u201cCrustacea,\u201d and Hexapoda), as well as six classes, 34 orders and 304 families of arthropods ( Table 1 and Table S1 ). While we cannot determine the exact number of morphospecies that were collected, there were at least 579 morphospecies based on our most conservative estimates (calculated by summing the maximum number of morphospecies for each family ever found in a single room). \n \n Discussion \n \n As household pests and disease vectors, the indoor arthropods in our daily lives have had a substantial impact on human society both historically and today. Although extensive research has been done on a small number of arthropod pest species, the data presented herein represent the first comprehensive survey of the arthropod diversity collected from urban and suburban houses. In the absence of similar studies that could provide baseline data for comparison, our results are surprising both in terms of the prevalence of arthropods (virtually every room was occupied) and in terms of their diversity. \n \n The diversity of arthropods found indoors extends far beyond commonly recognized species. We found that an individual house may have hundreds of arthropod species within it, with each house on average containing 62 families and a minimum estimate of 93 morphospecies. The true diversity among these 50 homes is undoubtedly much higher due to limitations of the minimum estimate (it assumes no species turnover between rooms), the presence of cryptic species and our sampling method that excluded areas behind walls, under heavy furniture, and in drawers and cabinets, all of which undoubtedly serve as potential refuges for additional arthropods. While sampling 50 homes did lead to a decrease in the estimated diversity of families, clearly there are still many other families and morphospecies that are yet to be recovered and characterized from homes (Fig. 2). \n \n We found that four groups of arthropods dominate the average room: flies (23%), beetles (19%), spiders (16%) and hymenoptera (predominantly ants, 15%) (Fig. 5). Overall, there are more types of flies associated with human homes than any other group of animals. Some flies have evolved close associations with humans, while others (Chironomidae and Cecidomyiidae) may arrive in houses as part of \u2018air plankton\u2019; their presence indoors is more a reflection of their abundance outdoors than of the ecology inside homes. Despite their prevalence, flies represent only a small proportion of taxon-focused studies in the urban landscape (McIntyre, 2000). Recent studies have revealed new information on flies in urban landscapes, including 30 new scuttle fly species identified from urban Los Angeles (California, USA), indicating that the true diversity of these flies, and likely many other small fly groups, in human-developed areas is underestimated (Grimaldi et al., 2015; Hartop, Brown & Disney, 2015). \n \n Book lice (Psocodea: Liposcelididae), were found to be among the most ubiquitous indoor arthropods (found in 49 of 50 houses). Book lice are close relatives of parasitic lice and have a long evolutionary history of living, among other places, in close association with birds, mammals and their nests (including those of primates; Grimaldi & Engel, 2005). As stored grain pests, fungus feeders, and scavengers, book lice thrive in indoor environments. Liposcelis bostrychophila Badonnel, for example, is a globally-distributed, anthropophilic species whose widespread success and resistance to control measures is in part due to its parthenogenesis, ability to disperse through air, wide diversity of diet, and resistance to starvation (Diaz-Montano et al., 2014). Book lice have become more common in houses in the United Kingdom over time (recovered from 14% of houses sampled in 1987 versus 30% in 1997; Turner & Bishop, 1998) and are more prevalent in areas of high humidity in houses in Spain (such as kitchens and bathrooms; Baz & Monserrat, 1999). However, perhaps due to North Carolina\u2019s humid climate or our sampling methods, we found book lice distributed throughout houses. \n \n Dust mites were found in the majority of homes (76%). Previous studies have found dust mites in 30\u2013100% of sampled homes across the US (Arlian et al., 1992). Human association with dust mites may have been established with the origins of dense human settlements; dust mites likely shifted from the nests of synanthropic birds or rodents to human houses (Klimov & O\u2019Connor, 2013). To control dust mite populations, it is often recommended to remove carpets because they provide protection, thermoinsulation, higher humidity, and trap the food on which these mites feed (Colloff, 1998). As expected, we found much higher dust mite abundance on carpeted surfaces, consistent with previous research. Yet, paradoxically, the house that had the single highest abundance of dust mites within our study had a wood floor. Humidity levels and vacuuming frequency, although unknown for this house, may explain the discrepancy. Characteristics of different wood floors, such as age and quality of build, could also affect mite abundance since gaps between boards can provide habitat for mite populations. \n \n Because previous studies of indoor arthropods have largely focused on pest groups of economic and human health importance (e.g., Runstrom & Bennett, 1990; Colloff, 1998; How & Lee, 2010; Crissman et al., 2010), we expected common pests to be among the most frequently found groups of arthropods in the homes. In fact, we found a relative dearth of typical household pests. The only exception to this was the prevalence of the smoky brown cockroach, a species that is not truly considered pestiferous because it does not generally develop pest-level populations in homes due to its need for high humidity and moisture (Robinson, 2005). It may be that we collected more specimens of this species due to their intolerance and ultimate death within the homes. While the lack of many pest species could be an artifact of the sampling design (sampling for species occurrence rather than abundance, as well as sampling in free-standing homes rather than other forms of human habitation such as apartments, townhouses, etc.), it appears that the vast majority of arthropods that live among us cause no direct harm. Unfortunately, many insects and arthropods we collected are considered pests based solely on their presence in the home (i.e., nuisance invaders; Hahn & Ascerno, 1991; Cranshaw, 2011), despite having no direct impact on people or their possessions. \n \n Many arthropods we identified from houses were unexpected\u2014either in terms of the frequency with which they were found or because they are rarely found outdoors, much less indoors. Gall midges (Cecidomyiidae), although found in every house sampled, were not even mentioned among the over 2,000 species listed in a recent compilation of urban insects and arachnids (Robinson, 2005). Leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), as plant feeders, are not associated with the indoor biome (Robinson, 2005), yet were among the groups most frequently found in houses. Moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera), on the other hand, were collected infrequently, making up only 2% of the average diversity in a room; this is disproportionate to their known overall diversity (the order comprising over 10% of described insect species; Heppner, 2008). Although ants (Formicidae) were expected and found in 100% of houses, further identification at the genus and species level revealed taxa that are not typically thought to occur in homes. Camel crickets (Rhaphidophoridae) are known basement dwellers in the Southeastern US, but our sampling confirmed previous reports that an invasive species, Diestrammena asynamora (Adelung) predominates over native species (Ceuthophilus spp.) (Epps et al., 2014). Other unexpected finds were ant-loving crickets (Myrmecophilidae), the smallest orthopterans (Whitman, 2008), which were found in homes with ant infestations; beetles from the relatively rare suborder Archostemata (families Cupedidae and Micromalthidae); and a larval beaded lacewing (Berothidae), a rarely seen neuropteran known to live within termite nests where they paralyze termites with an airborne chemical before feeding on them (Johnson & Hagen, 1981). \n \n Of the arthropods we found that live out a portion of their life cycle in human houses, there is a broad diversity of trophic levels and life histories represented. Apart from a few herbivorous arthropods associated with houseplants or those inadvertently living indoors (for example, brought in on cut plants), most taxa sampled from houses were either scavengers, predators, or parasitoids. Carpet beetles (Dermestidae) were found feeding on dog kibble, dead insects and nail clippings. Other scavengers, like silverfish (found in 68% of homes) and book lice were also common. Carrion-feeding flesh flies (Sarcophagidae) were found during the study emerging from a rodent killed by a house cat. Spiders (including spitting spiders, Scytodidae, that spit venom up to a centimeter to ensnare prey; Foelix, 2011) and centipedes (especially Scutigeridae) were the primary predators sampled. Minute parasitoid wasps (especially Eulophidae and Platygastridae s.l.) that potentially parasitize other household arthropods were also common inhabitants. For instance, one species of Eulophidae, Aprostocetus (Tetrastichodes) hagenowii (Ratzeburg) (Table S1), a known parasitoid of blattid cockroach egg cases (oothecae), was commonly collected in homes as were its hosts. Considering the range and abundance of life histories found in our study, the trophic dynamics of the indoor ecosystem is an area in need of future study. \n \n The rich arthropod diversity we identified from houses reflects a gradient of association with human habitations, from synanthropic arthropods that appear strongly adapted to human houses (cobweb spiders, carpet beetles, book lice), to others that seek shelter and resources only on occasion (ants, ground beetles, hunting spiders, smoky brown cockroaches), to many groups that simply become trapped in houses to their own detriment (leafhoppers, gall midges, click beetles). Most of the arthropod groups we identified do not have life histories that are known to be closely associated with the indoors. Many arthropods may find themselves indoors as a result of the \u2018Malaise trap effect\u2019: houses, like Malaise and other flight intercept traps, are effective at capturing local arthropods that may be travelling through the environment or are attracted to houses by artificial light, food, and shelter. These arthropods may be active in a house for a short period of time, where interactions between them and the house\u2019s residents may occur, but eventually they must either find an exit or succumb to mortality. The idea that homes are traps or filters of local, outdoor arthropod fauna implies the importance of further investigating the dynamics between the greater landscape and the indoor environment. \n \n Biodiversity in urban landscapes is richer than was once thought (McKinney, 2008; Fattorini, 2011; Fattorini, 2014), and we find here that the indoor, manufactured environment also supports more diversity than anticipated. These findings represent a new understanding of the makeup of the indoor arthropod community and their distribution within houses. Arthropods within our homes are both diverse and prevalent, and are a mix of closely synanthropic species and a great diversity of species that wander indoors by accident. Many species we found were unexpected, unnoticed by residents until they were collected, and play no pestiferous role in human houses. Yet, further research on the ecological dynamics of the indoor biome is needed to understand the potential economic and health implications of the species that live and have evolved in such close proximity to us. ||||| Matt Bertone \n \n If only they paid rent. There are on average 100 species of creepy-crawly in every house, according to the first comprehensive census of house-dwelling arthropods. \n \n Some are part of an intricate ecosystem that relies on crumbs and nail clippings for food. Others are accidental visitors trapped in this strange and dangerous world, unbeknownst to most homeowners. \n \n Advertisement \n \n The survey found 579 species, mainly insects, spiders, beetles, mites, flies and ants, in 50 detached houses in the leafy suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina. \u201cThe residents were really surprised and often horrified that we found so much, so we had to calm them down by saying it was normal,\u201d says Matt Bertone of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, who led the survey. \n \n He says the results dispel ideas that modern homes are sterile deserts, showing instead that they teem with unseen life. \u201cThe biggest surprise was finding at least one species in almost every room, with only five of the 554 rooms drawing a blank,\u201d says Bertone. Some have adapted to live in human homes permanently, such as cobweb spiders and booklice. \n \n Bertone says that the species the team spotted most frequently are known to be abundant worldwide, but the exact proportions of creatures found in this suburb may differ from those in inner-city tower blocks or rural houses. \n \n Home ecosystem \n \n The arthropods were found anywhere from carpets and floorboard cracks to shelves and skirting boards. \n \n The good news is that most are unlikely to harm you or your house. In fact, many pest species, such as bed bugs or German cockroaches, were absent from most of the houses. \n \n The only creatures found in every home were ants, carpet beetles, cobweb spiders and gall midges. \u201cThey rely on things we produce or have in our homes,\u201d says Bertone. \n \n Taken together, these regulars form a neat ecosystem, with spiders and centipedes as apex predators, hunting smaller fry such as carpet beetles and other spiders. \n \n The carpet beetles and book lice do much of the clearing up, scavenging dead insects, moulds and algae, as well as polishing off food crumbs and detritus from our own bodies, including nail clippings, hair and dead skin. Some carpet beetles live on and consume spiders\u2019 webs. \n \n Personal jungle \n \n Other species, such as house flies, stray in temporarily, maybe for food or warmth in harsh weather. Still others come in by accident and are usually trapped and doomed once indoors. \n \n \u201cThe indoor environment has proved to be full of unexpected biological diversity and houses are our own personal jungles,\u201d says Anne Madden of the University of Colorado at Boulder. \u201cWe clearly have much to learn about the potential food webs in our homes.\u201d \n \n \u201cUnderstanding the life that permeates our dwellings is essential to establishing the influence of our indoor life on our health,\u201d says Jack Gilbert of Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois. \u201cInsects have their own bacteria and move them round a house, so by understanding their biodiversity, we can better explain the distribution of microbes around our homes.\u201d \n \n Another recent survey of 1200 households across the United States found that household dust holds an average of 9000 different species of bacteria and fungi. \n \n Gallery \n \n See seven of the creepy-crawlies found lurking in homes \n \n Journal reference: PeerJ, DOI: 10.7717/peerj.1582 \n \n Read more: \u201cWhy insects are the real rulers of the world\u201c ||||| How many insects do you think are in your home? None? One? A hundred? Some new research suggests you need to step that number up by a factor of 10. Or more. But don't panic: Insects and their relatives are living peacefully in your home. They aren't bothering you. Well, except psychologically, now that you know hundreds of them are there. \n \n Entomologists have been saying for years it's not possible to have a completely bug-proof home; now there are numbers to back that up. Scientists carefully collected all the arthropods (insects, spiders, mites, and crustaceans, among others) they found in 50 homes in North Carolina. In every single home they examined, they found extra residents. Of 554 rooms in those homes, all but five (less than 1 percent) had some crunchy squatters. If you think your house is spotless and bug-free, you are wrong. When you move into an empty house, it\u2019s not really empty. You have roommates. \n \n Over 400 people volunteered to have entomologists search their homes for bugs after a public call for participation. Because really, how often do you get to have a group of PhDs crawl around your house on their hands and knees for free? \n \n The research group chose a representative selection of homes, big and small, from 7 to almost 100 years old. They limited themselves to visible surfaces under and behind furniture, baseboards, ceilings, and shelves. I asked researcher Matt Bertone what it was like to knock on a someone's door, introduce yourself, and then spend hours crawling around their floor with a headlamp and tweezers. He said it wasn\u2019t awkward until the end (well, more awkward than what you\u2019d expect if a complete stranger looked under your couch and bed). \n \n Before leaving, the collection team reviewed what they found with the homeowners. It was a bit of a shock for some. \u201cI think they thought we would only find a few things, and we would come back with hundreds of specimens,\u201d said Bertone. His team collected and identified more than 10,000 specimens during the course of the study. On average, more than 93 different species lived in each home. And that is an extremely conservative estimate. \n \n Bertone et al 2016 \n \n All the houses examined contained flies, beetles, spiders, and ants. Almost all of the houses (98 percent) contained booklice, harmless tiny insects you\u2019ve probably never heard of. Booklice eat mold and mildew, commonly found in starchy paste of books and wallpaper. \n \n Don\u2019t start pricing flamethrowers on Amazon just yet. \u201cIt's very benign,\" says Michelle Trautwein, co-author on the study. \"We all have these quiet roommates that really don't have a lot of negative impact on our lives.\u201d Most of the arthropods found were described by the researchers as \u201cair plankton\"; they were accidental entrants into the home that got trapped and died there. \n \n For example, the group found gall midges (Cecidomyiidae) in every home, even though their entire life cycle takes place outdoors. There is nothing for them to eat in a human home. Gall flies are also representative of many arthropods found in one other way: They are best seen with a microscope. A big gall fly is about 2 mm long. \n \n Mat Bertone, NCSU \n \n \u201cSo much of what we find in houses is incredibly tiny, and even if you're looking for it, you wouldn't be able to find it,\u201d said Trautwein. Someone who isn\u2019t a specialist might never see them unless they know what to look for. \u201cI\u2019d be crawling around and I'd see fecal specs and I go, 'Okay, there's a spider under there,'\" says Bertone. \"People don't know what those are. They see those little spots, but they have no idea that it's spider poop.\u201d \n \n Now that you are suspicious about every speck you might see in your house, here\u2019s what the researchers didn\u2019t find: not a single brown recluse spider or bed bug. They didn\u2019t find very many fleas. Most of the arthropods they found were harmless, minute, accidental visitors lured in from the outdoors to a quiet death from starvation, dehydration, or cobweb spiders. \n \n The number of bugs in our houses makes more sense when you consider that human-built spaces encompass an area as large as some natural biomes globally. But we know far more about the animals outside our houses than in them. \u201cThe finding that \u2018non-pest\u2019 species made up the majority, ... and the sheer number and prevalence of arthropod groups found highlights [our] current lack of knowledge,\u201d says University of Liverpool biologist Crystal Frost. \n \n Many of the insects identified in the study weren\u2019t able to be identified to species\u2014and some of them will probably turn out to be new species. Our homes aren't the Galapagos Islands, but they are unique environments that organisms may specialize in. We know that some fungi are found only in bathrooms and washing machines, and the same is quite likely of a few insects and spiders from this study. Carpet beetles, clothes moths, and cobweb spiders have limited abilities to disperse on their own, but we move them from place to place with our belongings. \n \n This research is being continued across several continents, with hopes of finding patterns in our arthropod bunkmates. Their preliminary data is clear\u2014you\u2019ve got bugs in your house. All of you. \n \n Keep Calm and Arthropod On \n \n You probably weren\u2019t freaking out about the hundreds (probably thousands) of tiny animals in your home before you read this, so why not strive to reclaim that Zen state of blissful ignorance? Even better, embrace the amazing diversity all around you. Wildlife doesn\u2019t stop at your doorstep. It comes inside with you and lives on you. \n \n Our homes are places of extreme environments and change. Showers go from dry to torrents of scalding water in an instant; sinks are deluged with minty alcoholic mouthwash, caustic cleaners, and hair from our grooming rituals. Humidity and temperature in ductwork change abruptly as air conditioning or heating kicks on. Anything that manages to live in this environment should get at least a little grudging admiration. \n \n This research is just the latest in a series of papers beginning to investigate the urban environment around you. Most of the info is profoundly disturbing to people who want their homes to be immaculate. Microbial communities on our pillow cases and toilet seats are remarkably similar. Follicle mites are having sex in your facial pores right now. In the last 50 years, American basements were quietly taken over by a foreign species of camel cricket. No one noticed. It's exploration of a whole new frontier, a new environment in which we can all be participants in the science. \n \n You are an animal, surrounded by other animals. Get. Over.

(See \"Why Did Thousands of Venomous Spiders Swarm a House?\") \n \n \u201cNobody had done a comprehensive inventory like this before, and we found far more diversity than most people would expect,\" says study leader Matt Bertone, an entomologist at North Carolina State University. \n \n \u201cThat old wives\u2019 tale that you\u2019re never more than ten feet [three meters] away from a spider? If you\u2019re in your home, that might be true,\u201d Bertone says: His team found spiders in all of the homes surveyed. \n \n Home is Where the Bugs Are \n \n For the study, Bertone and colleagues visited 50 free-standing houses in and around Raleigh, North Carolina. \n \n \u201cWe had two or three entomologists searching the houses, crawling on our hands and knees with flashlights and collecting anything we could find into vials,\u201d says Bertone.

Each house was home to anywhere between 32 and 211 arthropod species, according to the study, published January 19 in the journal Peer J. \n \n In addition to the sheer number of species, the researchers were surprised at how many bugs they found in the homes. Out of more than 550 rooms sampled, only five were totally bugless. (See \"7 Bug and Spider Myths Squashed.\") \n \n Although some of the species have adapted to live happily alongside humans, such as book lice, others, such as leafhoppers and gall midges, are accidental visitors. These bugs simply wander in from the outdoors and can become trapped and die, the study authors say. \n \n Peaceful Cohabitators \n \n There are probably even more bugs in our homes, since the researchers only collected arthropods from visible surfaces, excluding areas such as behind walls, under heavy furniture, and in drawers and cabinets, Bertone says. \n \n But he emphasizes that we shouldn't be afraid of the bugs in our midst\u2014the vast majority are not harmful. Typical household pests, such as German cockroaches, termites, and fleas, were only present in a few homes, the survey found. And those ubiquitous spiders found in every home are very benign\u2014not to mention they eat pests. (Related: \"What Should You Do If You Find a Spider in Your House?\") \n \n \u201cMy take-home message to the homeowners was that these things are living among you but they\u2019re not dangerous and you won\u2019t see them unless you really look for them,\u201d says Bertone. \u201cThey are peacefully cohabitating with us.\u201d \n \n Jason Cryan, an entomologist at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, says he's \"not bothered by the fact that they are finding so much arthropod diversity in our homes.\" \n \n \u201cIn many cases this diversity goes unseen and unheard,\u201d says Cryan, who was not involved in the study. \n \n \u201cI hope people will appreciate this natural diversity and realize that this life among us is not a health or a cleanliness concern.\u201d",

    "input": "Obama spokesman: That Romney birth certificate joke is \u201cgutterball politics\u201d \n \n posted at 4:17 pm on August 24, 2012 by Allahpundit \n \n In case you\u2019re wondering what it takes to offend a campaign whose allies have accused Romney of tax evasion based on anonymous \u201csources\u201d and blamed him for leaving a steelworker\u2019s wife to die from cancer uninsured, here you go. Turns out Obama, whose major contribution to deficit reduction this past year was the fiscal joke known as the \u201cBuffett Rule,\u201d is running a serious, substantive campaign while Romney, who just took up the sword of entitlement reform by picking Paul Ryan, is all about smears and distractions. The things you learn on MSNBC. \n \n Two points. One: I don\u2019t get why Romney would step on his own message to make a birth certificate joke. He\u2019s spent the past week neck-deep in culture-war quicksand thanks to Todd Akin and is looking at another week of it once the Democratic convention opens. He could have used today to talk about unemployment or his energy policy or whatever, but instead he chose to throw the press some chum with this. (One of his aides told BuzzFeed that the line wasn\u2019t in Romney\u2019s prepared remarks but was delivered off-the-cuff. I\u2019ll bet.) The point, I guess, is to prove that he\u2019s capable of being politically incorrect by tweaking the media on a subject that makes them hyperventilate like almost nothing else, but anyone who cares much about that was voting for him already. It\u2019s hard enough for Romney to break through the media\u2019s wall of nonsense to reach voters. Why hand them another brick? \n \n Two: This is the perfect ending to a week marked by criticism from Jake Tapper and, more tepidly, Chuck Todd that the media isn\u2019t doing its job. From the moment this sentence escaped Romney\u2019s lips, it was a metaphysical certainty that it would dominate political coverage for the rest of the day, with MSNBC\u2019s pants-wetting expected to last well into the evening. No one expected otherwise even though everyone understands that few votes, if any, will shift because of this. When I started reading blogs years ago, it was relatively rare for reporters to admit that the media is biased or prone to trivial treatment of momentous events; whenever a reporter or editor actually \u2018fessed up \u2014 the example that sticks in my mind was Daniel Okrent acknowledging the patently obvious fact that the NYT is a liberal newspaper \u2014 it was big news, a moral victory for conservatives who demanded that the press own up to its prejudices. These days, my sense is that they\u2019re more willing to own up (they have to be since there are so many more critics online cataloging them) but that they\u2019ve started to use their candor almost as an excuse to be as trivial as they want. Sure, they\u2019ll spend three days navel-gazing about Romney\u2019s dumb joke, but as long as Todd or Bob Schieffer or some other big name TV journalist sighs afterward and admits that it\u2019s silly to spend three days on this, well, then that\u2019s proof that they have \u201cintegrity\u201d after all. Three cheers for progress. \n \n Two clips for you here, one of Obama\u2019s flack checking the various talking-point boxes and the other, via the Examiner, of MSNBC being very MSNBC-ish. \n \n Related Posts: ||||| Romney says \"birther\" joke wasn't a swipe at Obama \n \n (CBS News) In an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Scott Pelley on Friday, Mitt Romney played down the remarks he made about President Obama's origins, arguing that they amounted to a joke and not a \"swipe\" at the president. \n \n \"No, no, not a swipe,\" Romney said. \"I've said throughout the campaign and before, there's no question about where he was born. He was born in the U.S. This was fun about us, and coming home. And humor, you know -- we've got to have a little humor in a campaign.\" \n \n Romney was on the campaign trail in his home state of Michigan Friday when he made a crack at the \"birther\" suspicions that ultimately drove Mr. Obama to release his long-form birth certificate to prove he was born in the United States. \n \n \"I love being home in this place where Ann and I were raised, where both of us were born. Ann was born in Henry Ford Hospital. I was born in Harper Hospital,\" Romney said in Commerce, Michigan earlier Friday. \"No one's ever asked to see my birth certificate. They know that this is the place that we were born and raised.\" \n \n Romney told Pelley that taking the stage in Michigan Friday was an emotional moment for him and his wife Ann. \n \n \"You just felt, you know, you felt sort of everything that happened to us here - how we grew up, how we met here, the sacrifices that our families made - coming to Michigan, you know, it all sort of just washed over me as we got up on that stage,\" he said. \"It was a very emotional feeling. It's a feeling of coming home.\" \n \n While Romney's remarks may have amounted to an off-the-cuff joke, they elicited a swift and harsh response from the Obama campaign. \n \n \"Throughout this campaign, Governor Romney has embraced the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them,\" Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt emailed reporters. \"It's one thing to give the stage in Tampa to Donald Trump, [Arizona] Sheriff [Joe] Arpaio, and [Kansas Secretary of State] Kris Kobach. But Governor Romney's decision to directly enlist himself in the birther movement should give pause to any rational voter across America.\" \n \n The Obama campaign also capitalized on the incident with a fundraising pitch to supporters. In an email with the subject line, \"A new low for Mitt Romney,\" campaign manager Jim Messina asked supporters to \"take a moment or two to think about [Romney's remark], what he's actually saying, and what it says about Mitt Romney. Then make a donation of $5 or more to re-elect Barack Obama today.\" \n \n The joke, in fact, was a departure from the way Romney has typically handled the \"birther\" issue. \n \n \"I think the citizenship test has been passed. I believe the president was born in the United States. There are real reasons to get this guy out of office,\" Romney said in April 2011. Romney this year defended his alliance with Donald Trump, an outspoken \"birther,\" but Romney made clear he disagreed with Trump on the issue. \n \n When Pelley asked Romney if he agrees Mr. Obama is the \"legitimate president of the United States,\" Romney responded, \"I've said that probably 30 times by now, and 31 certainly won't hurt.\" \n \n More from Pelley's interview with Romney will air Friday and Monday, August 27 on the CBS Evening News with Scott Pelley. Additional excerpts will air during CBS News' primetime coverage of the Republican National Convention, Tuesday, August 28 through Thursday, August 30, beginning at 10 p.m. ET each night. ||||| COMMERCE, Mich. \u2014 In a speech to thousands of supporters at a family orchard outside Detroit Friday afternoon, Mitt Romney tried a joke as he touted his family roots in the state \u2014 and got himself in trouble in the process. \n \n After he and Mrs. Romney both took turns talking about how excited they were to be \u201chome\u201d in Michigan, Romney said, \u201c\u201cNobody ever has to see my birth certificate. They know this is the place where I was born and raised.\u201d \n \n The line, which prompted laughter and then cheers from the roughly 5,000 people gathered here, was an apparent reference to the long-debunked conspiracy theory that President Obama was born in Africa, and therefore not Constitutionally qualified to be president. \n \n But the Romney campaign quickly pushed back against questions about whether Romney was invoking \u201cbirtherism.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe governor has always said, and has repeatedly said, he believes the president was born here in the United States,\u201d said adviser Kevin Madden. \u201cHe was only referencing that Michigan, where he is campaigning today, is the state where he himself was born and raised.\u201d \n \n A campaign aide told BuzzFeed, on condition of anonymity, that Romney did not plan the birth certificate joke in advance, and that it was an \u201coff-the-cuff reference to him being a homegrown guy of Michigan\u201d that was wrongly interpreted by the press. \n \n Still, a spokesman for the Obama campaign seized on the opportunity to decry Romney for extremism. \n \n \u201cThroughout this campaign, Governor Romney has embraced the most strident voices in his party instead of standing up to them,\u201d said spokesman Ben LaBolt. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to give the stage in Tampa to Donald Trump, Sheriff Arpaio, and Kris Kobach. But Governor Romney\u2019s decision to directly enlist himself in the birther movement should give pause to any rational voter across America.\u201d \n \n Meanwhile, the reaction from the crowd of Republicans here was largely enthusiastic, with some laughing it off as a politically incorrect joke, and others treating it as a welcome attack on what they believe to be the coverup of the president\u2019s birthplace. \n \n Asked what he made of Romney\u2019s line, Jim Barzakov, a retiree from Berryville, MI, expressed frustration with reporters\u2019 fixation on the issue. \n \n \u201cWhat is it with this birth certificate? It\u2019s every question I get from you guys!\u201d he said. \u201cYou must be all liberals! What kind of a question is that?\u201d \n \n He then said the meaning of the line was simple: \u201cIt says Romney has his birth certificate; Obama can\u2019t find his.\u201d Asked about the certificate the White House released last year, Barzakov dismissed it as a \u201cphotoshop certificate.\u201d \n \n Therese Cayline, who works at a real estate management company in Waterford, MI, said she doesn\u2019t consider herself a \u201cbirther\u201d \u2014 but raised several of the talking points espoused by skeptics of the president\u2019s birth certificate. \n \n \u201c[Romney] was born and raised in Michigan and as far as Obama goes, his grandma was there at his birth and his grandma has never been outside Kenya,\u201d Cayline said. \u201cSo I find it ironic that he won\u2019t show the real birth certificate.\u201d \n \n But Laura Barnett, 22, from Wesfield, MI, said the birth certificate line was just a joke, not to be taken too seriously. \n \n \u201cI think people, if they want to make it controversial, they can,\u201d Barnett said. \u201cBut I think Romney was just being a little funny. I know the racism is serious and it\u2019s very controversial like I said but I think there\u2019s always room for some humor.\u201d",

This represents a significant increase from the previous reward offer of $10 million announced in October 2011. \n \n Protecting the homeland and the American people is our top counterterrorism priority, and just as we have intensified our efforts against ISIL, we are increasing the means available to us to gain information on their leadership and bring them to justice. In June 2014, ISIL, also known as Da\u2019esh, seized control of portions of Syria and Iraq, self-declared a so-called Islamic caliphate, and named al-Baghdadi as caliph. In recent years, ISIL has gained the allegiance of jihadist groups and radicalized individuals around the world, and has inspired attacks in the United States. \n \n Under al-Baghdadi, ISIL has been responsible for the deaths of thousands of civilians in the Middle East, including the brutal murder of numerous civilian hostages from Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The group also has conducted chemical weapons attacks in Iraq and Syria in defiance of the longstanding global norm against the use of these appalling weapons, and has enabled or directed terrorist attacks beyond the borders of its self-declared caliphate. \n \n In 2011, the Department of State designated Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist under Executive Order 13224.

REUTERS/Social Media Website via Reuters TV/File Photo \n \n WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Friday more than doubled its previous reward for information on Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, offering $25 million for information that would help locate, arrest or convict the head of the jihadist group. \n \n The U.S. State Department\u2019s Rewards for Justice program previously offered $10 million for information on Baghdadi, announced in October 2011.

They last spoke a month ago, when Mr. Trump called Mr. Putin following a terrorist attack in St. Petersburg. \n \n Their discussion on... ||||| Russian President Putin To Meet Merkel, Talk To Trump By Phone \n \n Vladimir Putin on Tuesday meets with Germany's chancellor for the first time in two years. Their relationship was strained after Russia's intervention in Ukraine. Putin then speaks to President Trump. \n \n DAVID GREENE, HOST: \n \n No Western leader knows Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, better than German Chancellor Angela Merkel. And their relationship has been difficult. You think about Ukraine. You think about the sanctions on Russia. You think about the conflict in Syria. Well, today, Putin will greet Merkel in the resort town of Sochi. That's a resort town he loves. It is where the 2014 Winter Olympics were held. And this is Merkel's first visit to Russia in two years. NPR's Lucian Kim is in Moscow and joins us. Good morning, Lucian. \n \n LUCIAN KIM, BYLINE: Good morning, David. \n \n GREENE: So why this Putin-Merkel meeting and why now? \n \n KIM: Well, I think you could actually ask why has it taken so long? Yeah, Merkel has really reduced her contacts with Putin to a minimum. She's really been focused on finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Ukraine which has largely disappeared from the headlines. Her official reason for coming now to Russia is to prepare for the G20, the Group of 20 major economies summit in Germany in July. But, of course, the timing is really important. \n \n The European Union today is looking probably more vulnerable than it has ever. And Putin is looking like the most stable leader in the region. So I think it's kind of a recognition that you need to talk to Russia if you want to solve any problems. \n \n GREENE: That is amazing to have arrived at that point where European countries feel like Putin is the most stable potential ally. So that's really what Merkel's trying to get from Putin, some sort of promise that he's going to work with Europe in a progressive way, in a productive way? \n \n KIM: Well, maybe not as an ally, but, I mean, he's not going away. He's been, you know, in power since 2000. The only other leader is Merkel that's been around that long. But I think it's - it's, as I said, it was more - it's more of a recognition that you're going to have to deal with him if you're going to reach a resolution in Ukraine or in Syria. He has become the indispensable leader. And I think that's why Merkel is also - is going and is ready to talk to him. \n \n GREENE: How do Russians view this meeting? Do they want Putin to get closer to leaders like Merkel in the West? \n \n KIM: Well, I think for Russians it's very important or for Putin it's very important to be seen as someone who is a major player. So by speaking to Merkel, that obviously helps him. And he's really been on a roll. He just spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Abe last week. And tomorrow, he's going to meet the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in Sochi, as well. So I think this - the international buzz around him definitely helps him because it shows that Russia is a player that the rest of the world cannot ignore. \n \n GREENE: Well, and speaking of that, I mean, he has - Putin also has a phone call with President Donald Trump later today. How does that all fit into his diplomacy? \n \n KIM: Well, that's really key. I mean, what's interesting is that it's coming after the Merkel phone call. And, you know... \n \n GREENE: The meeting, yeah. \n \n KIM: ...A lot of the - exactly. And a lot of the same issues are - affect the U.S.-Russian relations. That's Ukraine, Syria, terrorism. And under Obama, Merkel handled a lot of the European relations. So it's going to be interesting if Trump will also farm out, you know, dealing with Putin to Merkel. \n \n GREENE: OK, speaking to NPR's Lucian Kim in Moscow about some diplomacy that Vladimir Putin is taking part in today, including a phone call with Donald Trump.

REUTERS/Ivan Sekretarev/Pool/Lucas Jackson/File Photos \n \n MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump will speak by phone on Tuesday, RIA news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. \n \n Trump will speak with Putin on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. EDT, the White House said on Monday night. \n \n A senior Trump administration official said the two leaders would likely discuss the civil war in Syria, where Moscow backs the government of Bashar al-Assad and the United States supports rebels trying to overthrow him. ||||| U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have spoken together by telephone for the third time since Trump took office in January. \n \n The scheduled phone conversation on May 2 was the first between the two leaders since the United States carried out a missile strike against a Syrian air base in retaliation for what Western countries charged was a chemical-weapons attack against civilians by Syrian government forces. \n \n A White House statement described the conversation as \"a very good one\" -- including discussions on the war in Syria, \"working together to eradicate terrorism throughout the Middle East,\" and \"how best to resolve the very dangerous situation in North Korea.\" \n \n The White House also announced that Washington will send a representative to Syria peace talks scheduled in Astana, Kazakhstan, on May 3 and 4. \n \n A Kremlin statement said the emphasis of their phone conversation was on coordinating Russian and U.S. actions in the fight against terrorism. \n \n It said the two agreed to increase dialogue between U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in an attempt to bring a resolution to the war in Syria. \n \n Moscow also said Trump and Putin both expressed support for the idea of organizing their first face-to-face meeting on the sidelines of the July 7-8 summit of the Group of 20 (G20) in Hamburg, Germany. \n \n On North Korea, the Kremlin said Putin called upon Trump to show restraint and make an effort to reduce tensions that have been raised in the aftermath of North Korea's nuclear-weapons and ballistic-missile tests. \n \n Several hours before their phone conversation, Putin met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Russian Black Sea port of Sochi for talks focusing on the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria, as well as on strained bilateral relations. \n \n Both leaders said after their May 2 meeting that it is essential for all parties to fulfill their commitments under the Minsk process to regulate the conflict in eastern Ukraine between government forces and Russia-backed separatists. \n \n \"Today we once again reiterated the necessity of the strict observation of the Minsk agreements by the parties to the conflict [in eastern Ukraine],\" Putin told journalists. \n \n Merkel said Moscow and Berlin \"are of differing opinions about the cause of the conflict.\" She said it was essential for Kyiv to regain complete control of its border, including the portion between the separatist-controlled areas and Russia. \n \n Putin and Merkel also discussed the six-year-old civil war in Syria. Putin repeated Russia's calls for an \"impartial investigation\" into the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria's Idlib Province last month that left about 80 people dead. \n \n Putin also said Russia was counting on the United States to help find \"efficient solutions\" to the conflict in Syria. \n \n Merkel said she spoke to Putin about domestic developments in Russia, including the arrests of demonstrators at recent anticorruption rallies and media reports about the persecution of homosexual men in the Russian North Caucasus region of Chechnya. \n \n \"The possibility of the right to demonstrate is a part of civil society,\" Merkel said. \n \n She also urged Putin to \"use his influence\" to put an end to the abuse of homosexuals in Chechnya. \n \n Russia's Novaya Gazeta reported in April that at least 100 gay men had been abducted by security forces in Chechnya and at least three had been killed. \n \n Putin defended the actions of Russian police, saying they acted within the framework of the law and showed \"far more restraint than their colleagues in other European countries.\" \n \n Putin also categorically rejected allegations that Moscow interfered in the U.S. presidential election in November or was playing any role in Germany's domestic politics. \n \n The Russia leader said it was \"unthinkable\" that Russia would interfere in the domestic affairs of other countries. He dismissed the reports of interference in the U.S. election as \"rumors.\" Putin added that Moscow would not tolerate outside interference in its own domestic affairs. \n \n In January, the U.S. intelligence community issued an assessment charging that Putin \"ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election.\" Security agencies in Germany, France, and other countries have also alleged Russian efforts to influence their electoral processes. \n \n For her part, Merkel said she was confident Germany could handle any disinformation campaigns and would take \"decisive measures\" in the event of interference. She also noted that \"hybrid warfare plays a role in Russia's military doctrine.\" \n \n The two leaders also discussed preparations for the G20) summit in Hamburg on July 7-8. The G20 is now the chief format for Russia to meet the other world powers after its exclusion from the Group of Eight (G8), which is now the G7. \n \n In addition to his talks with Merkel, Putin is scheduled to talk by telephone with U.S. President Donald Trump later on May 2. \n \n Merkel's one-day trip was her second visit to Russia since Moscow seized the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in March 2014. \n \n Russia and Germany have scaled back ties and Merkel has strongly backed EU sanctions on Moscow for seizing Crimea and for its involvement in the war that has killed more than 9,900 people in eastern Ukraine since 2014. \n \n A key mediator in the conflict, which pits Russia-backed separatists against Ukrainian government forces, Merkel is a major proponent of keeping the sanctions on Moscow in place until a stalled peace plan is fulfilled. \n \n Merkel has attended several meetings with Putin, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, and France's Francois Hollande aimed at implementing the Minsk II agreement, which she and Hollande brokered in February 2015. \n \n The most recent such meeting was held in October and the four leaders spoke by phone in April, agreeing to step up implementation of the peace deal. \n \n With reporting by dpa, AP, TASS, and Reuters",

The most recent tension flared when the US accused Moscow of lying about a chemical attack on civilians in Syria, and Reuters expect Syria's civil war to be a topic of discussion. Trump and Putin have spoken twice by phone since Trump took office, notes Radio Free Europe, which adds that the two leaders have not scheduled a face-to-face meeting. Both are expected to attend the G20 summit in Germany in July. Before talking with Trump, Putin will host German Chancellor Angela Merkel in the Black Sea city of Sochi.

    "input": "Drugs, Devices & Supplements \n \n Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Medicines (NSAIDs) (Also Called 'NSAID', 'Motrin', 'Ibuprofen', 'Naproxen') \n \n What do nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs do? \n \n Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) effectively reduce inflammation (swelling) and relieve pain. Inflammation is the body's way of protecting itself after irritation or an injury. Signs of inflammation include redness, warmth, swelling, and pain. \n \n NSAIDs are used to treat a variety of symptoms such as pain, inflammation, and stiffness caused by rheumatoid arthritis and tendonitis. NSAIDs are also used to treat several other conditions, such as: \n \n Osteoarthritis \n \n Muscle aches \n \n Backaches \n \n Dental pain \n \n Pain caused by gout \n \n Bursitis, and \n \n Menstrual cramps \n \n They may also be used to reduce fever or relieve minor aches caused by the common cold. \n \n How do NSAIDs work? \n \n NSAIDs work by blocking the production of certain body chemicals that cause inflammation. NSAIDs are effective in treating pain caused by slow, prolonged tissue damage, such as the pain from an arthritic joint. NSAIDs are also effective in treating general or localized pain, such as back pain, menstrual cramps, and headaches. \n \n NSAIDs work like corticosteroids (also called steroids), without many of the side effects of steroids. Steroids are man-made drugs that are very similar to cortisone, a naturally-occurring hormone. Like cortisone, NSAIDs are effective in reducing pain and inflammation often associated with joint and muscle diseases and injuries. \n \n Are NSAIDs available without a prescription? \n \n Yes. Over-the-counter NSAIDs are available without a prescription, in much lower doses than prescription NSAIDs. Current over-the-counter NSAIDs include: \n \n Aspirin compounds (such as Anacin \u00ae , Ascriptin \u00ae , Bayer \u00ae , Bufferin \u00ae and Excedrin \u00ae ) \n \n , Ascriptin , Bayer , Bufferin and Excedrin ) Ibuprofen (such as Motrin \u00ae and Advil \u00ae ) \n \n and Advil ) Naproxen sodium (such as Aleve\u00ae) \n \n Over-the-counter NSAIDs are effective in treating mild osteoarthritis and some muscle injuries. Ibuprofen and naproxen are also used to treat fever. As with any medication, always follow the directions on the label and the instructions from your healthcare provider. \n \n How long should I use an over-the-counter NSAID? \n \n Never use an over-the-counter NSAID continuously for more than three days for fever, and 10 days for pain, without talking to your healthcare provider. Over-the-counter NSAIDs are effective pain-relievers, but they are intended for short-term use. When taking NSAIDs for long periods of time, you should be carefully monitored by your healthcare provider so he or she can watch for harmful side effects and change your treatment, if necessary. \n \n How long do NSAIDs take to work? \n \n Depending on the NSAID and the condition being treated, some NSAIDs may work within a few hours, while others may take a week or two before most benefits are achieved. Generally, for acute muscle injuries, we recommend NSAIDs that work quickly; however, these may need to be taken as often as every four to six hours because of their short action time. \n \n For osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis that need long-term treatment, we usually recommend NSAIDs that need to be taken only once or twice a day. However, it generally takes longer for these drugs to have a therapeutic (healing) effect. \n \n When are NSAIDs prescribed? \n \n NSAIDs are often prescribed for rheumatologic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and moderate-to- severe osteoarthritis. NSAIDs are also prescribed for moderately painful musculoskeletal conditions such as back pain. \n \n How are NSAIDs prescribed? \n \n NSAIDs are prescribed in different doses, depending on the condition that is being treated. These drugs may need to be taken from one to four times a day. Do NOT increase the dose without asking your health care provider first. \n \n Your healthcare provider may prescribe higher doses of NSAIDs if you have rheumatoid arthritis, for example, because this disease often causes a significant degree of heat, swelling, and redness and stiffness in the joints. Lower doses may be prescribed for osteoarthritis and acute muscle injuries, since there is generally less swelling and frequently no warmth or redness in the joints. \n \n No single NSAID is guaranteed to work. Your healthcare provider may prescribe several types of NSAIDs in order to find the one that works best for you. Avoid aspirin and alcoholic beverages while taking NSAIDs. \n \n What are some prescription NSAIDs? \n \n Below is a list of some prescription NSAIDS. Please note: this is NOT an all-inclusive list. In addition, many NSAIDs are only available as generic formulations. \n \n Generic name/brand name (if still available) \n \n celecoxib (Celebrex \u00ae ) \n \n ) diclofenac (Voltaren \u00ae [available by brand name in topical form]) \n \n [available by brand name in topical form]) diflunisal \n \n etodolac \n \n fenoprofen (Nalfon \u00ae ) \n \n ) flurbiprofen \n \n ibuprofen \n \n indomethacin (Indocin \u00ae [available by brand name in liquid form]) \n \n [available by brand name in liquid form]) ketoprofen \n \n ketorolac tromethamine \n \n meclofenamate sodium \n \n mefenamic acid (Ponstel \u00ae ) \n \n ) meloxicam (Mobic \u00ae ) \n \n ) nabumetone \n \n naproxen sodium (Anaprox \u00ae , Naprosyn \u00ae ) \n \n , Naprosyn ) oxaprozin (Daypro \u00ae ) \n \n ) piroxicam (Feldene \u00ae ) \n \n ) sulindac \n \n tolmetin \n \n salicylate \n \n salsalate (Disalcid\u00ae) \n \n How will my healthcare provider choose an NSAID that is right for me? \n \n In planning your treatment, your healthcare provider will take into account the effectiveness and the risks of drugs. Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an appropriate treatment program. The drugs that will be prescribed will match the seriousness of your condition. Your healthcare provider will consider the results of your medical history, physical exam, X-rays, blood tests, and the presence of other medical conditions in creating your treatment plan. \n \n It is important to meet with your healthcare provider regularly so he or she can watch for any harmful side effects and change your treatment, if necessary. Your healthcare provider may order blood tests or other tests (including a kidney function test) from time to time to determine how effective your treatment is, and to look for any harmful side effects. \n \n Are there specific warnings associated with NSAID use? \n \n The Food and Drug Administration added new warnings about NSAIDs in July 2015. \n \n NSAIDs can increase the chance of heart attack or stroke. This risk may be greater if you have heart disease or risk factors (for example, smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes) for heart disease. However, the risk may also be increased in people who do not have heart disease or those risk factors. \n \n Heart problems caused by NSAIDs can happen within the first weeks of use, and may happen more frequently with higher doses or with long-term use. \n \n NSAIDs should not be used right before or after heart bypass surgery. \n \n NSAIDs may increase the chance of serious stomach and bowel side effects like ulcers and bleeding. This risk may be greater in older individuals. These side effects can occur without warning signs. \n \n What are some common side effects of NSAIDs? \n \n Side effects may occur if you are taking large doses of NSAIDs, or if you are taking them for a long time. Some side effects are mild and go away, while others are more serious and need medical attention. \n \n Please note: The side effects listed below are the most common. All possible side effects are not included. Always contact your healthcare provider if you have questions about your particular medication. \n \n The most frequently reported side effects of NSAIDs are gastrointestinal symptoms, such as: \n \n Gas \n \n Feeling bloated \n \n Heartburn \n \n Stomach pain \n \n Nausea \n \n Vomiting \n \n Diarrhea and/or constipation \n \n These side effects can generally be relieved by taking the drug with adequate amounts of food. NSAIDs may also be taken with milk or antacids (such as Maalox\u00ae or Mylanta\u00ae) to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms. \n \n If the symptoms continue, the NSAID may need to be stopped. You should contact your healthcare provider if the symptoms listed above do not stop after a few days of taking the NSAID with food, milk, or antacids. \n \n Some other side effects of NSAIDs include: \n \n Dizziness \n \n Feeling lightheaded \n \n Problems with balance \n \n Difficulty concentrating \n \n Mild headaches \n \n If these symptoms continue for more than a few days, stop taking the NSAID and contact your healthcare provider for more instructions. \n \n What side effects should I tell my healthcare provider about right away? \n \n If you have any of the following side effects, it is important to call your healthcare provider right away. \n \n Fluid retention (recognized by swelling of the mouth, face, lips or tongue, around the ankles, feet, lower legs, hands, and possibly around the eyes) \n \n Ringing in the ears \n \n Severe rash or hives or red, peeling skin \n \n Itching \n \n Unexplained bruising and bleeding \n \n Unusual weight gain \n \n Black stools \u2013 bloody or black, tarry stools \n \n Bloody or cloudy urine \n \n Severe stomach pain \n \n Blood or material that looks like coffee grounds in vomit (bleeding may occur without warning symptoms like pain) \n \n Blurred vision \n \n Wheezing, trouble breathing, or unusual cough \n \n Chest pain, rapid heartbeat, palpitations \n \n Acute fatigue, flu-like symptoms \n \n Jaundice \n \n Photosensitivity (greater sensitivity to light) \n \n Change in strength on one side is greater than the other, trouble speaking or thinking, change in balance \n \n Inability to pass urine, or change in how much urine is passed \n \n Very bad back pain \n \n Very bad headache \n \n Feeling very tired and weak \n \n Can I take NSAIDs if I'm being treated for high blood pressure? \n \n NSAIDs can raise blood pressure in some people. Some people with high blood pressure (hypertension) may have to stop taking NSAIDs, if they notice that their blood pressure increases even if they are taking their blood pressure medications and following their diet. If you are taking blood pressure medication, talk to your healthcare provider before taking NSAIDs. \n \n Is there anyone who should not take NSAIDs? \n \n People who have the following conditions or circumstances should not use any type of NSAID until they are first evaluated by their healthcare provider: \n \n Children and teenagers with viral infections (with or without fever) should not receive aspirin or aspirin-containing products due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. \n \n Those who have an upcoming surgical procedure, including dental surgery \n \n Diabetes that is difficult to control \n \n Known kidney disease \n \n Known liver disease \n \n Known allergies to medications, especially aspirin, other NSAIDs, and sulfa drugs \n \n Nasal polyps (linked to a greater chance of NSAID allergy) \n \n Active peptic ulcer disease (stomach ulcers or previous history of stomach ulcer bleeding) \n \n Gastroesophageal reflux disease, also known as GERD \n \n Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis \n \n Bleeding problems (people who have a history of prolonged bleeding time or who bruise easily) \n \n People who have three or more alcoholic beverages per day \n \n High blood pressure that is difficult to control \n \n Active congestive heart failure \n \n Asthma that gets worse when taking aspirin \n \n Pregnancy in the third trimester \n \n History of stroke or heart attack \n \n If you are 65 years of age or older \n \n Simultaneous use with certain medications such as warfarin (Coumadin \u00ae ), clopidogrel (Plavix), corticosteroids (for example, prednisone), phenytoin (Dilantin \u00ae ), cyclosporine (Neoral \u00ae , Sandimmune \u00ae ), probenecid, lithium (Lithobid \u00ae ) and drugs used for various disease states such as arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and vitamins and other dietary/herbal supplements \n \n ), clopidogrel (Plavix), corticosteroids (for example, prednisone), phenytoin (Dilantin ), cyclosporine (Neoral , Sandimmune ), probenecid, lithium (Lithobid ) and drugs used for various disease states such as arthritis, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and vitamins and other dietary/herbal supplements Phenylketonuria (PKU). Some nonprescription NSAIDs are sweetened with aspartame, a source of phenylalanine. \n \n Before you start taking over-the-counter NSAIDs, have your physician or pharmacist evaluate all of your current medications to see if there would be any potential interactions. \n \n Can NSAIDs cause allergic reactions? \n \n Very rarely, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent can cause a generalized allergic reaction known as anaphylactic shock. If this happens, it usually occurs soon after the person starts taking the NSAID. The symptoms of this reaction include: \n \n Swollen eyes, lips, or tongue \n \n Difficulty swallowing \n \n Shortness of breath \n \n Rapid heart rate \n \n Chest pain \n \n Decrease in sedation \n \n If any of these symptoms occur, call 9-1-1 or have someone drive you to the nearest emergency room immediately. \n \n Before medication is prescribed, tell your healthcare provider: \n \n If you are allergic to any medications, foods, or other substances \n \n If you are currently taking any other medications (including over-the-counter medications) and/or herbal or dietary supplements \n \n If you are pregnant, planning to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding \n \n If you have problems taking any medications \n \n If you have anemia, kidney or liver disease, stomach or peptic ulcers, heart disease, high blood pressure, bleeding or clotting problems, asthma, or growth in the nose (nasal polyps) \n \n Before you start taking any new medication, ask your healthcare provider: \n \n What is the name of the medication? \n \n Why do I need to take it? \n \n How often should I take it? \n \n What time of day should I take it? \n \n Should I take it on an empty stomach or with meals? \n \n Where should I store the medication? \n \n What should I do if I forget to take a dose? \n \n How long should I expect to take the medication? \n \n How will I know it is working? \n \n What side effects should I expect? \n \n Will the medication interfere with driving, working, or other activities? \n \n Does the medication interact with any foods, alcohol, or other medications (including over-the-counter medications, herbal and/or dietary supplements)? \n \n This information is a summary only.

(WNCN) \u2013 For the last several years, the FDA has warned that ibuprofen, Naproxen and other NSAID-type painkillers may cause an increased risk for heart disease and stroke. \n \n Now the FDA has strengthened its warning for these drugs and says that these agents absolutely do raise the risk for heart attack and stroke. \n \n The FDA said it reviewed a large number of studies that supported the conclusion that the medicines caused increased risk. The studies estimated that the relative risk increased by 10 percent to 50 percent, depending on the drugs and the doses considered. \n \n The new FDA warning covers drugs called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDS for short. They include ibuprofen, sold under brand names like Advil or Motrin; naproxen (Aleve), as well as prescription arthritis drugs known as COX-2 inhibitors, such as Celebrex. \n \n Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs work by inhibiting production of prostaglandins\u2014(by inhibiting an enzyme called cyclooxygenase). Prostaglandins are chemicals released by injured cells that trigger inflammation and pain. It is important to remember that Tylenol, known generically as acetaminophen, is not an NSAID and works in a different way. It is not included in this new FDA warning. Tylenol also has potential health risks and this includes liver damage and toxicity when taken in very high doses. \n \n Prescription NSAIDs are an important treatment for the symptoms of many debilitating conditions, including arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis\u200e, gout and other rheumatological conditions. \n \n NSAIDs are used to temporarily reduce fever and to treat minor aches and pains such as headaches, toothaches, backaches, muscular aches, tendonitis, strains, sprains and menstrual cramps. \n \n Remember that in addition, some combination medicines that relieve various symptoms, such as multi-symptom cold products, contain NSAIDs. \n \n According to an FDA spokesman, the \u201cFDA is strengthening an existing warning in prescription drug labels and over-the-counter (OTC) drug facts labels to indicate that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke, either of which can lead to death.\u201d \n \n The FDA has carefully reviewed the data for the last year and has found that in numerous studies it has been clear that the use of NSAIDS is associated with an increased risk for heart disease and stroke. \n \n Some of the studies they looked at showed a clear pattern: people who took NSAIDS were more likely to have heart attacks or strokes. Many of the researchers found that the time course of the development of heart disease can be both early and late in the course of starting NSAIDS. \n \n The FDA added a boxed warning to prescription drug labels for the increased risk for heart disease and stroke in 2005. More recent data has now prompted the FDA to update NSAID labeling. \n \n Today we know that the risk of heart attack and stroke may occur early in treatment, even in the first weeks. People who have cardiovascular disease, particularly those who recently had a heart attack or cardiac bypass surgery, are at the greatest risk for cardiovascular adverse events associated with NSAIDs. This particular population is at very high risk\u2014they are quite vulnerable and should avoid NSAIDs when possible. \n \n The bottom line is that NSAIDs are effective treatments for pain, inflammation and fever. \n \n Consumers can still take them but should be aware of this increased risk of heart attack or stroke, especially at higher doses. \n \n If you have heart disease or high blood pressure, talk with your doctor before using an NSAID. \n \n Together, with your doctor, you must balance the benefits of NSAIDs with the possible risks. \n \n Seek urgent medical attention and stop taking NSAIDs if you experience symptoms that might signal heart problems or stroke \u2014 chest pain, trouble breathing, sudden weakness in one part or side of the body, or sudden slurred speech. If you take these drugs, take the smallest effective dose. \n \n To get in touch with Dr. Campbell, you can head to his website, Facebook page or message him on Twitter. ||||| Espa\u00f1ol \n \n Subscribe: FDA Consumer Health Information \n \n Next time you reach into the medicine cabinet seeking relief for a headache, backache or arthritis, be aware of important safety information for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. \n \n FDA is strengthening an existing warning in prescription drug labels and over-the-counter (OTC) Drug Facts labels to indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke, either of which can lead to death. Those serious side effects can occur as early as the first few weeks of using an NSAID, and the risk might rise the longer people take NSAIDs. (Although aspirin is also an NSAID, this revised warning doesn\u2019t apply to aspirin.) \n \n The OTC drugs in this group are used for the temporary relief of pain and fever. The prescription drugs in this group are used to treat several kinds of arthritis and other painful conditions. Because many prescription and OTC medicines contain NSAIDs, consumers should avoid taking multiple remedies with the same active ingredient. \n \n The Risks and What\u2019s New \n \n Prescription NSAIDs are an important treatment for the symptoms of many debilitating conditions, including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis\u200e, gout and other rheumatological and painful conditions. OTC NSAIDs are used to temporarily reduce fever and to treat minor aches and pains such as headaches, toothaches, backaches, muscular aches, tendonitis, strains, sprains and menstrual cramps. Common OTC NSAIDs include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). In addition, some combination medicines that relieve various symptoms, such as multi-symptom cold products, contain NSAIDs. \n \n \u201cBe careful not to take more than one product that contains an NSAID at a time,\u201d says Karen M. Mahoney, M.D., deputy director of FDA\u2019s Division of Nonprescription Drug Products. How will you know? Check the list of active ingredients in the Drug Facts label. \n \n The labels for both prescription NSAIDs and OTC NSAIDs already have information on heart attack and stroke risk. In the coming months, FDA will require manufacturers of prescription NSAIDs to update their labels with more specific information about heart attack and stroke risks. FDA will also request that the manufacturers of OTC NSAIDs update the heart attack and stroke risk information in Drug Facts labels. \n \n FDA added a boxed warning to prescription drug labels for this risk in 2005. More recent data and information are prompting FDA to update NSAID labeling. Today we know that the risk of heart attack and stroke may occur early in treatment, even in the first weeks. \n \n \u201cThere is no period of use shown to be without risk,\u201d says Judy Racoosin, M.D., M.P.H., deputy director of FDA\u2019s Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia, and Addiction Products. \n \n People who have cardiovascular disease, particularly those who recently had a heart attack or cardiac bypass surgery, are at the greatest risk for cardiovascular adverse events associated with NSAIDs. \n \n FDA is adding information in the drug label for people who already have had a heart attack. This vulnerable population is at an increased risk of having another heart attack or dying of heart attack-related causes if they\u2019re treated with NSAIDs, according to studies. \n \n But the risk is also present in people without cardiovascular disease. \u201cEveryone may be at risk \u2013 even people without an underlying risk for cardiovascular disease,\u201d Racoosin adds. \n \n What Consumers Should Do \n \n NSAIDs are effective treatments for pain, inflammation and fever. Consumers can still take them but should be aware of this increased risk of heart attack or stroke, especially at higher doses. \n \n \u201cAs always, consumers must carefully read the Drug Facts label for all nonprescription drugs. Consumers should carefully consider whether the drug is right for them, and use the medicine only as directed. Take the lowest effective dose for the shortest amount of time possible,\u201d Mahoney says. \n \n When using prescription NSAIDs, read the consumer-friendly Medication Guide attached to your filled prescription, which provides important safety information. \n \n If you have heart disease or high blood pressure, consult a health care provider before using an NSAID. Balance the benefits of NSAIDs with the possible risks and weigh your options. If you take low-dose aspirin for protection against heart attack and stroke, you should know that some NSAIDs, including ibuprofen and naproxen, can interfere with that protective effect. \n \n Stop taking NSAIDs and seek medical help if you experience symptoms that might signal heart problems or stroke, such as chest pain, trouble breathing, sudden weakness in one part or side of the body, or sudden slurred speech. \n \n Reduce your risk factors for heart disease and stroke. \u201cSmoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes are significant risk factors for these conditions,\u201d Mahoney says. \u201cIf you smoke, work on quitting. See your doctor regularly to find out if you have these other strong risk factors, and commit yourself to taking care of them and of your health.\u201d \n \n July 9, 2015 \n \n back to top ||||| The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is strengthening an existing label warning that non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke. Based on our comprehensive review of new safety information, we are requiring updates to the drug labels of all prescription NSAIDs. As is the case with current prescription NSAID labels, the Drug Facts labels of over-the-counter (OTC) non-aspirin NSAIDs already contain information on heart attack and stroke risk. We will also request updates to the OTC non-aspirin NSAID Drug Facts labels. \n \n Patients taking NSAIDs should seek medical attention immediately if they experience symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath or trouble breathing, weakness in one part or side of their body, or slurred speech. \n \n NSAIDs are widely used to treat pain and fever from many different long- and short-term medical conditions such as arthritis, menstrual cramps, headaches, colds, and the flu. NSAIDs are available by prescription and OTC. Examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and celecoxib (see Table 1 for a list of NSAIDs). \n \n The risk of heart attack and stroke with NSAIDs, either of which can lead to death, was first described in 2005 in the Boxed Warning and Warnings and Precautions sections of the prescription drug labels. Since then, we have reviewed a variety of new safety information on prescription and OTC NSAIDs, including observational studies,1 a large combined analysis of clinical trials,2 and other scientific publications.1 These studies were also discussed at a joint meeting of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee held on February 10-11, 2014. \n \n Based on our review and the advisory committees\u2019 recommendations, the prescription NSAID labels will be revised to reflect the following information: \n \n The risk of heart attack or stroke can occur as early as the first weeks of using an NSAID. The risk may increase with longer use of the NSAID. \n \n The risk appears greater at higher doses. \n \n It was previously thought that all NSAIDs may have a similar risk. Newer information makes it less clear that the risk for heart attack or stroke is similar for all NSAIDs; however, this newer information is not sufficient for us to determine that the risk of any particular NSAID is definitely higher or lower than that of any other particular NSAID. \n \n NSAIDs can increase the risk of heart attack or stroke in patients with or without heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. A large number of studies support this finding, with varying estimates of how much the risk is increased, depending on the drugs and the doses studied. \n \n In general, patients with heart disease or risk factors for it have a greater likelihood of heart attack or stroke following NSAID use than patients without these risk factors because they have a higher risk at baseline. \n \n Patients treated with NSAIDs following a first heart attack were more likely to die in the first year after the heart attack compared to patients who were not treated with NSAIDs after their first heart attack. \n \n There is an increased risk of heart failure with NSAID use. \n \n We will request similar updates to the existing heart attack and stroke risk information in the Drug Facts labels of OTC non-aspirin NSAIDs. \n \n In addition, the format and language contained throughout the labels of prescription NSAIDs will be updated to reflect the newest information available about the NSAID class. \n \n Patients and health care professionals should remain alert for heart-related side effects the entire time that NSAIDs are being taken. We urge you to report side effects involving NSAIDs to the FDA MedWatch program, using the information in the \u201cContact FDA\u201d box at the bottom of the page.",
    "reference": "\u2013 The FDA advised back in 2005 that non-aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, could up the risk of heart attack and stroke. But the agency is now boosting that warning, noting that drugs like ibuprofen (often sold under the Motrin IB brand), naproxen (Aleve), and celecoxib (Celebrex) may pose a risk even in small amounts and that these drugs should be used sparingly and for short periods, the New York Times reports. (Aspirin, although an NSAID, doesn't pose the same risk, the FDA notes.) Although an FDA review found that higher doses increased the risk of heart attack or stroke\u2014and the risk may increase with length of use\u2014\"there is no period of use shown to be without risk,\" an FDA deputy director says. And while people with cardiovascular disease are more at risk for being adversely affected by NSAIDs, \"everyone may be at risk\u2014even people without an underlying risk for cardiovascular disease,\" the FDA rep says. NSAIDs decrease production of prostaglandins, chemicals spewed out after an injury that trigger inflammation, WNCN reports. Per the FDA review, over-the-counter NSAIDs could up the risk of heart attack and stroke by about 10%, low-dose prescription meds by 20%, and higher-dose prescription NSAIDs by 50%, with \"significant variability\" in each estimate, an Emory University medical professor tells the Times. One NSAID, Vioxx, was taken off shelves in 2004 after being linked to 140,000 heart attacks over a five-year period, Bloomberg notes. The director of Northwestern University's Center for Communication and Health says that \"one of the underlying messages (is) there are no completely safe pain relievers, period.\" How to cut down on potential NSAID risks, per the Harvard Health Blog: Take the lowest dose that works, limit how long you take it, and never take more than one NSAID at once. (Meanwhile, Benadryl may up your risk for Alzheimer's.)"

The city would pay at least $4.5 million but no more than $30 million over four years. \n \n The proposal \u201ccreates an innovative pathway for individuals served with gang injunctions to gain the job skills they need to turn their lives around,\u201d City Attorney Mike Feuer said in a statement. \n \n If a court approves the settlement, the city also will stop enforcing curfew restrictions that a federal court ruled were unconstitutional and provide an expedited way for people named in injunctions to be removed from the list. \n \n \u201cUnconstitutional gang injunction curfews forced several thousand black and brown residents of Los Angeles indoors on a nightly basis,\u201d Olu K. Orange, an attorney for the lawsuit plaintiffs, said in a statement. \u201cThese individuals are part of the Los Angeles community and this settlement is a step by city leaders toward showing them that their lives do matter.\u201d \n \n Gang injunctions were designed as a tool for fighting gang crime and violence. They give police the power to arrest reputed gang members named in the injunction for otherwise legal activities such as gathering in public, wearing gang colors or being outside in a specified gang area late at night. \n \n Since being pioneered in Los Angeles in the 1980s, the use of the injunctions has proliferated across the nation and even overseas. Vast swaths of Southern California have been subject to such injunctions. \n \n Advocates say the injunctions have reduced gang crime while opponents say they cast too wide a net and unfairly brand young men as gang members without due process. Courts have struck down portions of gang injunctions in Ventura and Orange counties. \n \n The proposed Los Angeles settlement covers a lawsuit that was filed in 2011 by two men who were arrested for violating curfew restrictions in an injunction. The men denied they were gang members and charges against them eventually were dismissed. \n \n Their lawsuit argued that the arrests violated their constitutional rights to free assembly, travel and protection from unlawful seizures. \n \n \u201cGang injunctions are a form of psychological abuse on a whole generation of young people of color,\u201d one of the men, Christian Rodriguez, said in a statement. \u201cBecause I was wrongly labeled as a gang member, I couldn\u2019t even be outside helping my mom with the groceries at night.

There are nearly 50 gang injunctions around Los Angeles prohibiting suspected gang members from carrying weapons, wearing certain clothes, or socializing with certain groups; 21 of those injunctions require suspected gang members to be inside by 10pm.

    "input": "Labor and business leaders have agreed in principle on the details of a new visa program for low-skilled foreign workers, clearing the last major hurdle for a bipartisan Senate proposal to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws, a person involved in the negotiations said Saturday. \n \n The agreement came late Friday after several days of negotiations between the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the AFL-CIO, the country\u2019s largest labor organization, as well as the eight senators involved in drafting the comprehensive immigration bill. \n \n The two sides agreed on how to overcome the final sticking points, including how much the foreign workers would be paid and which industries would be exempt from the guest-worker program. Final approval came in a phone call Friday night arranged by Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) with Chamber president Thomas Donohue and AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka, said the person involved in the talks, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. \n \n Trumka said in a statement Saturday night: \u201cWe have created a new model, a modern visa system that includes both a bureau to collect and analyze labor market data, as well as significant worker protections.\u201d He also reiterated the AFL-CIO\u2019s support for the overall reform effort, including the path to citizenship for undocumented migrants. \n \n But the complexity of the matter was highlighted when one member of the business community said Saturday afternoon that the lead negotiators on the business side had not seen written details of a final agreement and cautioned that declaring the matter resolved was premature. \n \n \u201cBusiness groups are still waiting to see the details. I don\u2019t know where it\u2019s coming from,\u201d the business official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the negotiations. \u201cI don\u2019t want to blow this up at all, but to say everyone\u2019s signed off on this is getting ahead of ourselves.\u201d \n \n Members of the Senate working group also declined to confirm the deal. Alex Conant, a spokesman for Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), wrote on his Twitter account, \u201cSenate negotiators are making good progress on immigration reform, but we\u2019re not done yet.\u201d \n \n A spokesman for Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) declined to comment Saturday. \n \n The person who disclosed the guest-worker deal said that all eight senators had not formally signed off on the terms but said that could happen over the next few days because all had been briefed at each stage of the talks. \n \n The guest-worker dispute was considered the final major impasse that threatened to delay the immigration bill that the Senate working group hopes to unveil in the second week of April. Senate aides, who will begin writing the hundreds of pages of legislation this week, cautioned that nothing in the deal is final until the four Democrats and four Republicans in the group have agreed to all portions of the written document. \n \n In addition to the guest-worker program, the Senate bill will feature a 13-year path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, increases in the number of visas for highly skilled tech workers, elimination of some categories of family visas and increases in border control and workplace security, people familiar with the talks have said. \n \n Though a number of smaller points are unresolved, Senate aides said they are hopeful that a bill can be introduced in the Judiciary Committee in time to be moved onto the Senate floor by Memorial Day. The goal would be to have a vote of the full Senate by the August recess, the aides said. The House has a proposal developed by its own bipartisan group that also could be unveiled in the next few weeks. \n \n President Obama, who has made immigration reform the top priority of his second term, has said he hopes to sign a comprehensive bill this year. In 2007, a dispute between business and labor over a guest-worker provision helped sink a bipartisan immigration bill in the Senate. The president has not taken a position on a guest-worker program this year. \n \n According to the person who disclosed the guest-worker deal, Schumer called White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough to inform him of the deal. The administration had mostly remained out of the daily negotiations as business and labor tried to work out the deal under the Senate\u2019s guidance. \n \n A White House spokesman said in a statement Saturday that the president \u201ccontinues to be encouraged by progress being made by the bipartisan group of Senators,\u201d adding, \u201cWe look forward to seeing language once it is introduced, and expect legislation to move forward as soon as possible.\u201d \n \n Businesses had lobbied for 400,000 new visas under the new program, but labor unions wanted far fewer because of concerns that such a system would negatively affect wages and benefits for American workers. \n \n Under the Senate\u2019s proposal, businesses would be allowed starting in April 2015 to hire 20,000 foreign workers for low-skilled jobs in a new \u201cW visa\u201d program \u2014 the number rising to 75,000 in 2019, according to people familiar with the details. \n \n After that, the number would rise and fall each year depending on recommendations from a new \u201cBureau of Immigration and Labor Market Research,\u201d which would analyze employment data. Those familiar with the talks said it would take many years before the visa program would approach the annual proposed cap of 200,000 foreign workers. \n \n Meanwhile, construction industries would be limited to no more than 15,000 visas annually and would be banned from hiring any foreign guest workers for more highly skilled technical jobs such as electrician positions. \n \n The Chamber and AFL-CIO agreed to a wage scale that would pay foreigners the greater of actual or prevailing wages. It would be based partly on a formula that takes into account actual wages paid by the employer to similarly situated U.S. workers, as well as regional and industry scales. \n \n Companies, except in the construction industry, could hire workers beyond the annual caps if they were willing to pay significantly higher wages. \n \n Union officials declined to comment Saturday. Blair Latoff Holmes, a spokeswoman for the Chamber, confirmed that Schumer and Donohue spoke Friday but said she did not know whether Donohue had spoken with Trumka. She declined to comment on whether a deal had been reached. \n \n \u201cThe senators will make the decisions about any final agreements and what makes the best public policy overall,\u201d Holmes said in an e-mail. \n \n Discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums. ||||| The accord between the influential business and labor groups all but assured that the bipartisan group of senators would introduce their broad immigration legislation in the next few weeks. Their bill, which they have been meeting about several times a week since the November election, would provide a path to citizenship for the 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country. It would also take steps to secure the nation\u2019s borders. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n A similar bipartisan group in the House has been meeting on and off for nearly four years, and hopes to unveil its own immigration legislation shortly. \n \n The agreement resolved what the pay level should be for low-skilled immigrants \u2014 often employed at hotels and restaurants or on construction projects \u2014 who could be brought in during labor shortages. \n \n Labor groups wanted to ensure that guest workers would not be paid less than the median wage in their respective industries, and the two sides compromised by agreeing that guest workers would be paid the higher of the prevailing industry wage as determined by the Labor Department or the actual employer wage. \n \n Photo \n \n Under the deal, guest workers would be allowed to pursue a path to citizenship and to change jobs after they arrived in the United States. \n \n Another sticking point, involving the specific type of jobs that would be included in the guest worker program, was also resolved. Though low-skilled construction workers will be included in the visa program, construction unions persuaded the negotiators to exclude certain types of more skilled jobs \u2014 like crane operators and electricians \u2014 from the program, officials involved in the talks said. \n \n According to officials with the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the program would start at 20,000 visas, rising to 35,000 visas in the second year, 55,000 in the third and 75,000 in the fourth. In the fifth year, the program would expand or shrink based on the unemployment rate, the ratio of job openings to unemployed workers and various other factors.

No more than 15,000 visas per year would go to construction occupations. \n \n Business groups, which had long been pushing to allow in 400,000 such guest workers each year, will get what they regard as an adequate number to meet the needs of employers. \n \n Mr. Schumer also spoke on Saturday with Denis McDonough, the White House chief of staff, to update him on the agreement.

But the nearest one is about 70 trillion miles away , which means that, for now, and for the foreseeable future, Earth is the only life-supporting rock hurtling through infinite space we\u2019ll ever know. It\u2019s really not the best idea to let it burn up\u2013and key to keeping it cool are the massive rainforests of the Amazon. Sadly, we\u2019ve had a hard time not cutting them down. \n \n A new project should help prevent\u2013or at least slow down\u2013that hot future. If all goes to plan over the next six years, a project led by Conservation International will become the largest tropical reforestation project in history. Seventy-three million trees will sprout up across what\u2019s known as the \u201carc of deforestation,\u201d in the Brazilian states of Amazonas, Acre, Par\u00e1, Rond\u00f4nia, and throughout the Xingu watershed. The short-term plan is to restore 70,000 acres (the area of 30,000 soccer fields) that have been cleared for pastureland to their former forested glory. \n \n \n \n \u201cIf the world is to hit the 1.2\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C [degrees of warming] target that we all agreed to in Paris, then protecting tropical forests in particular has to be a big part of that,\u201d M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, tells Fast Company. \u201cIt\u2019s not just the trees that matter, but what kind of trees. If you\u2019re really thinking about getting carbon dioxide out of atmosphere, then tropical forests are the ones that end up mattering the most.\u201d \n \n He\u2019s right: Simply stopping deforestation could allow existing forests to absorb up to 37% of our annual carbon emissions; replenishing degraded areas could do significantly more for the planet. \n \n \u201cThis is not a stunt,\u201d Sanjayan says. \u201cIt is a carefully controlled experiment to literally figure out how to do tropical restoration at scale, so that people can replicate it and we can drive the costs down dramatically.\u201d \n \n Over the past 40 years, about 20% of the Amazon has been cut down or destroyed, and scientists worry that another 20% of the rainforest will be lost in the next couple of decades. So, instead of following precedent and planting saplings, which are labor and resource intensive to manage (and, depending on the selected species, may not be best-suited for the territory, resulting in less than ideal survival rates), the organizing coalition is trying something different. \n \n \n \n Developed in Brazil only a few years ago, the new planting technique is called muvuca. \u201cIn Portuguese, it means a lot of people in a very small place,\u201d says Rodrigo Medeiros, Conservation International\u2019s vice president of the Brazil program and the lead on the ground. \n \n ||||| Assuming everything goes to plan, over the next six years, the Amazon rainforest will get 73 million new trees. The mass planting is part of a project sponsored by Conservation International, the Brazilian Ministry of Environment, and a number of other NGOs and corporations. As John Converse Townsend at Fast Company reports, it is the largest tropical reforestation effort ever attempted. \n \n According to a press release from Conservation International, the effort will span deforested pasture lands over a 74,000-acre region spanning several Brazilian states\u2014with the greatest focus in Southern Amazonas, Rond\u00f4nia, Acre, Par\u00e1 and the Xingu watershed. The purpose of the project is, in part, to revive the 20 percent of the Amazon that has been lost to deforestation due to agriculture and pasturing during the last 40 years. But the effort is also geared toward learning how to restore tropical forests. \n \n \u201cThis is a breathtakingly audacious project,\u201d says M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, according to the release. \u201cThe fate of the Amazon depends on getting this right\u2014as do the region\u2019s 25 million residents, its countless species and the climate of our planet.\u201d \n \n As Townsend reports, reforestation efforts are typically very costly and time consuming\u2014requiring people to both grow and plant thousands of saplings, many of which will not survive. In this latest effort, the restorationists are trying a new method called muvuca, in which they will spread the seeds of native trees across the slash and burned land and animal pastures. The seeds come from the Xingu Seed Network, which uses a coalition of 400 collectors to gather the seeds from native trees. \n \n \u201cWith plant-by-plant reforestation techniques, you get a typical density of about 160 plants per hectare,\u201d Rodrigo Medeiros, vice president of Conservation International\u2019s Brazil program, tells Townsend. \u201cWith muvuca, the initial outcome is 2,500 [trees] per hectare. And after 10 years, you can reach 5,000 trees per hectare. It\u2019s much more diverse, much more dense, and less expensive than traditional techniques.\u201d \n \n The muvuca experiment is the beginning of a massive effort announced by Brazil to restore 12 million hectares of forest, an area the size of Pennsylvania, as part of an effort to reach their climate change goals under the Paris Accord. Recent studies show that second growth forests\u2014those less than 60 years old that grow after logging or land clearance\u2014can sequester huge amounts of carbon. As Townsend reports, just stopping current deforestation could help mitigate 37 percent of current carbon emissions. Planting or restoring forests could make that number even bigger. \n \n While the effort is impressive, it\u2019s not the largest reforestation effort in the world. In July, 2016, 800,000 people in Uttar Pradesh, India, planted 50 million trees in just 24 hours, a publicity stunt to highlight India\u2019s Paris Accord commitment to reforest 12 percent of its land by 2030. The world\u2019s largest program, however, is China\u2019s Grain-for-Green effort, a plan to restore 69.2 million acres of forest land, which is an area the size of New York and Pennsylvania combined. \n \n All of these efforts are encouraging, but replanting is only half of the solution. Twenty-five million acres of forests are cleared each year, writes Doug Boucher, Director of Climate Research and Analysis at the Union of Concerned Scientists. He points out that while the long-term benefits of reforestation are helpful for the climate, the decades it takes for forests to regrow means it will take a while to see benefits. This means other more immediate solutions, such as reducing industrial emissions and halting the removal of forests, are still necessary to make a dent in our changing climate.",

The WFP says all sides in the conflict must approve food deliveries. \n \n U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien, who also just returned from Yemen, told the U.N. Security Council \"the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible.\" \n \n He said he was shocked by what he saw: Four out of five Yemenis are in need of humanitarian assistance, nearly 1.5 million people are internally displaced, and people were using cardboard for mattresses at a hospital where lights flickered, the blood bank had closed and there were no more examination gloves. \n \n Yemen's conflict pits Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh against southern separatists, local and tribal militias, Sunni Islamic militants and troops loyal to President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, who is in exile in Saudi Arabia. \n \n The humanitarian situation has steadily deteriorated since the fighting picked up in March, when Saudi Arabia launched a U.S.-backed coalition air campaign against Houthi forces and their allies, which control large swaths of the country, including the capital. \n \n Saudi Arabia views the Houthis as a proxy of its arch rival, Shiite powerhouse Iran, and an attempt to expand its influence on the Arabian Peninsula. Iran supports the Houthis politically but denies arming them. \n \n Pro-government forces pushed the rebels out of the southern port city of Aden last month and have made gains in the surrounding provinces. But their advance stalled on Tuesday after a rebel ambush killed dozens of fighters. \n \n Since August, the food program says it has been able to make 16 deliveries via sea to Yemen, accounting for over 123,000 metric tons of food. But difficulties remain because of the fighting, which has caused port closures. The western port city of Hodeida was hit with airstrikes Tuesday night. \n \n \"We actually had a ship berthed in port that was not damaged but had not been given clearance to offload when that bombing attack occurred,\" Cousin said. \"We're bringing in food from Hodeida that because of the conflict we can't get to the south. \n \n \"We have right now, a ship sitting off the port of Aden that has materials in it that we could use in the south, and we're still waiting for permission for that ship to come in,\" she said, adding that in order to access the rest of the country, all the ports must be open. \n \n Oxfam's country director, Philippe Clerc, said only two humanitarian vessels have been able to dock and off-load at the Hodeida port in the past more than two weeks. \n \n O'Brien, the U.N. humanitarian chief, called the airstrikes and shelling at Hodeidah a violation of international humanitarian law, saying they damaged \"the main lifelines\" for importing crucial food, medicine and fuel and could severely impact the entire country. \n \n Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, needs to import food even in peacetime. \n \n The WFP estimates that nearly 13 million people in Yemen lack proper access to food, with 6 million, or one in five of the country's population, in urgent need of assistance. The organization is seeking financial support for a $320 million emergency operation program it expects to launch in September. \n \n Other organizations also registered alarm on Wednesday over the desperate situation in Yemen. \n \n The U.N.'s humanitarian office says to 4,500 people have been killed and a further 23,000 have been wounded to date, many of them civilians. \n \n Human Rights Watch and 22 other human rights and humanitarian organizations said that the U.N.'s Human Rights Council should create a commission of inquiry to investigate allegations of war crimes by all parties since September 2014. \n \n In Geneva, the head of the International Red Cross said: \"Yemen after five months looks like Syria after five years.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writer Edith M. Lederer contributed to this report from the United Nations. ||||| The conflict in Yemen has killed nearly 400 children since the end of March, and a similar number of children have been recruited by armed groups, according to a new report by the UN children's agency. \n \n \n \n UNICEF's report released on Wednesday, says that 398 children have been killed and 377 others have been recruited to fight since the Saudi-led coalition began air strikes in Yemen. \n \n \"This conflict is a particular tragedy for Yemeni children,\" Julien Harneis, UNICEF Representative in Yemen, said. \n \n \"Children are being killed by bombs or bullets and those that survive face the growing threat of disease and malnutrition. This cannot be allowed to continue,\" he added. \n \n The UN said that as devastating as the conflict is for the lives of children, it will have terrifying consequences for their future. \n \n On Wednesday, Amnesty International, said that all sides fighting in Yemen have left a \"trail of civilian death and destruction\" in the conflict, killing scores of innocent people in what could amount to war crimes. \n \n The London-based rights group said the violence has been particularly deadly in the southern city of Aden and in Taiz, with dozens of children among those killed. \n \n Yemen's conflict pits the Houthis and troops loyal to former President Ali Abdullah Saleh against forces including southern separatists, tribal fighters and troops backing President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, who is in exile in Saudi Arabia. \n \n The Saudis are leading a US-backed Arab coalition that is carrying out air strikes against Houthi fighters since March. \n \n \n \n Civilian death toll \n \n Overall, the UN human rights office said on Tuesday, at least 1,950 civilians have been killed in the fighting and 1,3 million others have fled their homes. \n \n One minute Yemen \n \n The UN and aid groups have called repeatedly for ways to get food, fuel, medicine and other supplies into Yemen, but tight restrictions imposed by the coalition on air and sea transport remain in place, while Yemen's exiled government accuses the Houthis of hijacking aid. \n \n Yemen is the poorest country in the Arab world, and its population relies on imports for about 90 percent of its supplies. Attempts at UN-brokered humanitarian pauses to bring in aid have failed. \n \n The new UNICEF report says about 10 million children, or half of the country's population, need urgent humanitarian assistance. \n \n It also says more than half a million pregnant women in Yemen's hardest-hit areas are at higher risk for birth or pregnancy complications because they cannot get to medical facilities ||||| SANA\u2019A/ADEN - Seeing first-hand the challenges facing millions of people affected by the crisis in Yemen, the UN World Food Programme (WFP) Executive Director Ertharin Cousin, warned that lack of immediate and unhindered access to people who urgently need food assistance and the shortage of funding create the possibility of famine for millions, mostly women and children already hungry in this war-torn country. \n \n The conflict exacerbates the country\u2019s extremely fragile food security situation. WFP estimates that the number of food insecure people in Yemen is now close to 13 million, including 6 million who are severely food insecure and in urgent need of external assistance \u2013 that is one in five of the country\u2019s population. \n \n \u201cRight now, the conflict-driven convergence between the lack of staple food, access to clean water, and a diminished fuel supply create the dawn of a perfect storm for the most vulnerable Yemeni people,\u201d said Ertharin Cousin, WFP Executive Director. \n \n \u201cThe disruption in the commercial food sector creates significant reductions in imports which causes an inflationary effect on market prices for food and other basic commodities. As a result, we are starting to see a double effect of the conflict as even the people who could previously afford to meet their food needs are today unable to buy food.\u201d \n \n During a three-day visit, Cousin, travelled to Sana\u2019a, Amran and Aden. She met with displaced families taking refuge in school buildings, mothers and their young malnourished children at health centres and hospitals, as well as families at food distribution sites. She also held meetings with the authorities on both sides of the frontlines, WFP staff, UN sister agencies and NGO partners. \n \n More than 1.2 million children are suffering from moderate acute malnutrition and over half a million children are severely malnourished. \u201cThe damage to Yemen\u2019s next generation may become irreversible if we don\u2019t reach children quickly with the right food at the right time. We must act now before it is too late,\u201d said Cousin. \n \n The recent fighting around major ports will stall the commercial and humanitarian supplies to the country mainly food and fuel. Shortages of fuel are not only impacting the food distribution system of both the humanitarian and the private sector but will have a devastating effect on access to clean water, health, electricity and other basic services. \n \n WFP has reached 3.5 million people with food since the beginning of the conflict but the fighting makes deliveries difficult and dangerous. Many road networks in the hardest hit areas of the country are still not operational, making communities in conflict-areas inaccessible for aid workers. \n \n A recent vulnerability assessment conducted by WFP using mobile phone technology, reaching some of the households in areas inaccessible by teams on the ground, reflected that the deteriorating food security situation is particularly affecting the internally displaced families. Many families are existing on bread, rice and tea. The most common themes mentioned by the people interviewed for the assessment are \u201chigh food prices\u201d, \u201cshortages\u201d, \u201clack of water\u201d and a \u201cdeteriorating\u201d situation. \n \n The assessment showed that emergency food security conditions currently prevail in conflict-affected governorates. This phase is one step away from famine levels. Food insecurity is most severe for the country\u2019s 1.3 million internally displaced people. \n \n Shortage of drinking water is a critical issue. The price of water in Sana\u2019a had tripled since the start of the conflict because pumping systems have been hit by the lack of diesel fuel. Water is critical for families to prepare food and has an impact on people keeping livestock, which is very important for livelihoods in the country. \n \n An emergency operation planned to start in September is expected to cost some US$320 million for a period of six months. WFP implores the entire global community to recognize the urgency of the Yemeni crisis, with a specific call to those who have made commitments to expeditiously fulfil their pledges. WFP is grateful to the donors who have financially contributed or pledged support to the Yemen response including the European Commission (ECHO), Germany, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. \n \n # # # \n \n WFP is the world's largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide, delivering food in emergencies and working with communities to build resilience.

Pro-government forces have driven out the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels but the people are in desperate need. \n \n Many of the residential neighbourhoods have been reduced to ruins and thousands of Yemenis are still living in schools and mosques, with little access to food, water or medicine. There is no sign they are going to return home any time soon. \n \n A lot of areas around the city are full of landmines and explosive devices. One lady told me her neighbour went back to check his house after the fighting stopped, but the moment he opened the door an explosion was triggered. She said she doesn't want to face the same fate. \n \n As we walked around Aden, we saw some neighbourhoods overflowing with sewage water. Parents say their children are suffering from malaria, diarrhoea and skin diseases. \n \n Hospitals are overwhelmed with war casualties who don't receive adequate medical treatment. Many die on their way to the medical facilities because ambulances are poorly equipped. Doctors say many victims need to be taken abroad because their conditions are too serious to be treated in Yemen. \n \n Last month, government forces retook Aden from the Houthis in a major setback for the rebels. \n \n Meanwhile, UN humanitarian chief Stephen O'Brien, who has also just returned from Yemen, told the UN Security Council on Wednesday that \"the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible\". \n \n He also strongly criticised the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen for bombing the port of Hodeida, saying it was a violation of international humanitarian law. \n \n Image copyright EPA Image caption Gulf states intervened in Yemen in a bid to restore the exiled government's control \n \n A WFP ship was in the port, which is on the country's west coast, when it was hit by air strikes on Tuesday night. \n \n \"I am extremely concerned that the damage to the port of Hodeida could have a severe impact on the entire country and will deepen humanitarian needs,\" Mr O'Brien said. \n \n The UN has raised Yemen to its highest level of humanitarian crisis, placing it alongside emergencies in South Sudan, Syria and Iraq. \n \n Nearly 2,000 civilians are said to have died since the coalition began its bombing campaign in support of the exiled government in March. \n \n What makes a famine? \n \n As grim as the humanitarian situation is in Yemen, the WFP stops short of declaring a famine there in its latest update. \n \n The UN uses the term sparingly and will only declare a famine once certain conditions are met. \n \n They are: over 20% of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope; acute malnutrition rates exceed 30%; and the death rate exceeds two per day per 10,000 people. \n \n Calling the situation in Yemen a famine would instantly raise awareness, but that labelling makes little difference to the Yemeni people already suffering. \n \n The UN says a \"humanitarian catastrophe\" is under way, and has called for urgent support from donors. \n \n Why is there fighting in Yemen? \n \n Image copyright AFP \n \n Northern Shia Muslim rebels known as Houthis, backed by forces loyal to Yemen's ex-president, took over parts of Yemen, including Sanaa, and forced the government into exile in March \n \n The rebels accused the government of corruption and of planning to marginalise their heartland within a proposed federal system \n \n Forces loyal to the government, and southern militia, are fighting back, aided by air strikes led by neighbouring Saudi Arabia \n \n Yemen crisis: Who is fighting whom? \n \n Meeting the Houthis and their enemies ||||| 21 July 2011 \u0096 For many months United Nations aid agencies have warned of an impending crisis in the Horn of Africa as drought, failed harvests and fighting in some areas led to increasing food insecurity. Now conditions are so grim that the UN has turned to a word it uses sparingly and specifically \u2013 famine. \n \n Yesterday the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) declared that a famine exists in two regions of southern Somalia, and warned that the famine could soon spread to the rest of southern Somalia. \n \n While many countries worldwide face food security crises, with large numbers of people hungry and unable to find enough food, only rarely do the conditions meet the humanitarian community\u2019s formal criteria for a famine. The last time it was used in Somalia, for example, was in 1991-92, despite several periods of protracted drought and other problems in the intervening years. \n \n A famine can be declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met. They are: at least 20 per cent of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope; acute malnutrition rates exceed 30 per cent; and the death rate exceeds two persons per day per 10,000 persons. \n \n Other factors considered in these areas of Somalia include large-scale displacement, widespread destitution, disease outbreaks and social collapse. \n \n The definition has been developed through the work of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), which includes specialists from humanitarian agencies, including the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the UN World Food Programme (WFP), as well as leading non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and Government aid agencies. \n \n The gathering of data to determine whether the criteria are met is in this case in the hands of the UN-backed Food Security and Nutrition Analysis Unit-Somalia (FSNAU), which is administered by FAO. FSNAU then passes the information to the UN, aid agencies and the United States Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET). \n \n The declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the UN or Member States, but serves to focus global attention on the problem. \n \n According to WFP, famines have been declared previously in southern areas of Sudan in 2008; in Gode in the Somali region of Ethiopia in 2000; in the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea (DPRK) in 1996; in Somalia in 1991-1992, and Ethiopia in 1984-1985.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Things continue to deteriorate in Yemen as the conflict between Houthi rebels and pro-government forces grinds on. But now there's a new problem in the mix: a possible famine, created by what Ertharin Cousin, the executive director of the UN's World Food Programme, calls a \"perfect storm\" of \"lack of staple food, access to clean water, and a diminished fuel supply.\" In a press release, WFP estimates there are nearly 13 million of what it calls \"food insecure\" people in the war-torn country, with almost half in especially dire straits. That includes 1.2 million kids who suffer from \"moderate\" malnourishment and half a million who are severely affected. \"The damage to Yemen's next generation may become irreversible if we don't reach children quickly with the right food at the right time,\" Cousin says. \"We must act now before it is too late.\" Cousin saw the crisis firsthand during a recent three-day trip around the country, where she met with displaced families, moms and malnourished kids in hospitals, and people gathered at food-distribution centers. The UN's humanitarian chief also recently returned from Yemen and told the UN Security Council yesterday that \"the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible,\" per the BBC. Semantics means the WFP can't call the situation a full-fledged famine just yet: Per the UN, a food crisis is only considered as such if one-fifth of households have limited ability to deal with \"extreme\" food shortages; acute malnutrition rates surpass 30%; and the daily death rate is more than two per every 10,000 people. Continued conflict in Yemeni ports has exacerbated the problem, the BBC notes, with a WFP ship hammered by airstrikes Tuesday night in Hodeida. (Per UNICEF, 398 children have been killed in Yemen since March, Al Jazeera reports.)"

    "input": "Everyone, and I do mean everyone, is raving about how funny Saturday Night Live\u2018s \u2018Black Jeopardy\u2019 sketch was this week. If you like blacks being mocked for every stereotype under the sun, I guess you\u2019ll find the 6 minutes a real howl worth gittin\u2019 down wit. \n \n The Washington Post headline read: \u201cForget Trump and Clinton. \u2018Black Jeopardy\u2019 is SNL\u2019s best political sketch this year.\u201d \n \n \u2018Black Jeopardy\u2019 was replete with references to hot sauce, \u2018Big (black) Girls,\u2019 \u2018Lives Matter\u2019 \u2014 and of course, actor Tom Hanks playing Doug, a (racist, naturally) white Trump supporter. \n \n The host Darnell, played by Kenan Thompson, announces that \u2018Lives Matter\u2019 would be the final category, to which the black contestants Keely and Shanice give Doug a stone-faced look. \n \n \u201cWell, it was good while it lasted, Doug,\u201d chuckled Thompson. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to say about this,\u201d replied Hanks in a red-neck twang. \n \n \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure you do,\u201d quipped Thompson. \u201cWhen we come back, we\u2019ll play the national anthem and just see what the hell happens.\u201d \n \n Because now it\u2019s a thing. Or should I say \u2018thang\u2019? Black professional athletes refusing to stand or taking a knee when the national anthem is played before games. \n \n I admit I laughed when I watched the sketch, but later realized that Saturday Night Live would never have the audacity to produce a Jewish Jeopardy with categories like \u2018Nazi Noodnicks,\u2019 \u2018Merchant of Venice\u2019 or \u2018Penny For Your Thoughts\u2019\u2013\u2013because it wouldn\u2019t be considered funny, but rather anti-Semitic. If SNL is based on satire, why don\u2019t we see the show mocking Jews and Jewish culture? \n \n Yet, over and over again liberals think it\u2019s okay to mock so-called \u201cblack culture\u201d under the racist guise of comedy. Again, the notion being that all black people are one big, black stereotype, who vote Democrat, talk black, and hate white people. \n \n Before ABC\u2019s Blackish, there was Good Times, a sitcom about a black family living in a public housing project, and Sanford and Son, about black junk-yard dealer and his son. \n \n \u201cBlack Jeopardy\u201d has been a recent staple of SNL. This wasn\u2019t the first installment. \u201cHistorically, the sketch has embellished black stereotypes and mocked white people\u2019s political correctness,\u201d wrote the Washington Post reporter Dan Zak. \n \n Take note that Zak proudly juxtaposes the term \u201cblack stereotypes\u201d with white people\u2019s political correctness. What about white stereotypes? Zak, like SNL, gets away with this subtle racism because he\u2019s a white liberal writing for a left-leaning publication. \n \n The one stereotype missing from Black Jeopardy was any reference to blacks looting in the name of Black Lives Matter and getting away with it. Of course that would be HILARIOUS if it wasn\u2019t such an ugly reality (Baltimore, Ferguson). When was the last time you saw riotous masses of white people, burning down their neighborhoods, and looting stores for flat screen TVs, cigarettes, hooch or toiletries? \n \n \u2014 \u2014 \n \n Crystal Wright is author of the newly released book Con Job: How Democrats Gave Us Crime, Sanctuary Cities, Abortion Profiteering, and Racial Division.

And it\u2019s not just funny either\u2026it\u2019s the rare SNL skit that works brilliantly as cultural commentary. Kudos to the writers on this one. \n \n Update: Writing for Slate, Jamelle Bouie details why the Black Jeopardy sketch was so good; the title of the piece asks, \u201cThe Most Astute Analysis of American Politics in 2016?\u201d ||||| \"Tom Hanks plays a Donald Trump supporter\" could\u2019ve yielded some obvious (read: lazy) jokes when he hosted Saturday Night Live on October 22. Instead, the show made him play Black Jeopardy \u2014 and found a whole new way to talk about the nuances of this exhausting presidential election cycle. \n \n The Black Jeopardy sketch has been recurring since 2014, usually throwing well-meaning but ultimately clueless white people into a game that caters to its black contestants. Past categories have included \"They Out Here Saying,\" \"If It\u2019s Sunday,\" and \"Bruh...\" leading to repeated situations where the white \u2014 or in Drake\u2019s case, Canadian \u2014 contestants realize they have no idea how to play the \"black\" version of the game. \n \n So when SNL\u2019s latest rendition of the sketch introduced Hanks as a white contestant named Doug \u2014 wearing one of Trump\u2019s \"Make America Great Again\" hats and a T-shirt emblazoned with a bald eagle \u2014 it seemed like this odd man out was in for another huge loss. \n \n But then middle-aged white guy Doug kinda crushed Black Jeopardy. \n \n When faced with the answer, \"They Out Here Saying: The new iPhone wants your thumbprint \u2018for your protection,\u2019\" Doug immediately buzzed in with, \"What is, \u2018I don\u2019t think so, that\u2019s how they get ya\u2019?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" host Darnell Haynes (Kenan Thompson) said, incredulous, as Doug\u2019s fellow contestants (played by Sasheer Zamata and Leslie Jones) looked over in delighted shock. \n \n From there, Doug continued to ace the game. After sharing his distrust of the iPhone\u2019s thumbprint key, he also earned brownie points by insisting that Tyler Perry\u2019s Madea movies are worth every penny because they let him \"laugh and pray in 90 minutes.\" \n \n Everything about his appearance suggested he wouldn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t get along with anyone else on Black Jeopardy. But as written by Weekend Update co-anchor Michael Che and SNL co-head writer Bryan Tucker, Doug turned out to be far more chill with the black contestants\u2019 viewpoints than anyone might have expected, because it turned out they were his opinions too. \n \n By the time the show jumped into a category called \"Skinny Women Can Do This for You,\" Doug received actual cheers when he scoffed, \"What is, 'Not a damn thing'?\" \n \n However, despite having so much in common with the other people sharing the Black Jeopardy stage, Doug still didn\u2019t totally trust them. \n \n Throughout the game, he still showed signs of inherent bias, like when he skittered away from Darnell\u2019s attempt to shake his hand as if the host were about to beat him up, and then balked when the final category \u2014 \"Lives That Matter\" \u2014 came up. \n \n As a result, it\u2019s been interesting to see how some have interpreted the sketch. RawStory described it as Hanks going \"full deplorable,\" while Slate tweeted it like so: \n \n Watch Tom Hanks mock Trump supporters in SNL\u2019s Black Jeopardy: https://t.co/GntrKxm66r pic.twitter.com/wXRF0XguSR \u2014 Slate (@Slate) October 24, 2016 \n \n But saying that this Black Jeopardy sketch was only trying to mock Trump supporters is an incredible simplification of a brilliant comedic approach. \n \n Aside from Hanks playing Doug\u2019s grumbling shrugs to perfection, the sketch was smart and sly in the way it managed to find the center of a Venn diagram between people that few \u2014 from Dougs to Darnells and everyone in between \u2014 rarely try to find anymore. \n \n In under seven minutes, SNL dug into the commonalities between people who view each other as total opposites, the racially motivated anxieties of Trump\u2019s base, and many Americans\u2019 hesitance to cross increasingly polarized political lines in search of anything they might like on the other side. \n \n Finding the absurdity in the Trump versus Clinton debates is easy. Portraying the many subtleties of the American electorate in a sharp, hilarious, and different way this far into the campaign cycle is hard \u2014 and like Doug on Black Jeopardy, SNL crushed it. \n \n Updated to credit Michael Che and Bryan Tucker as the writers of this sketch. ||||| Just before midnight Saturday, Tom Hanks put on a denim shirt, a goatee and a red \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\u201d hat, and in six minutes pulled off the best political sketch of the year \u2014 and it didn\u2019t even feature Kate McKinnon or Alec Baldwin as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. \n \n \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d has staged its \u201cBlack Jeopardy\u201d sketch a few times before, pitting its African American cast members against white guest hosts who can\u2019t overcome their own whiteness to answer clues about black culture and jargon. This time, though, the white contestant \u2014 a Trump supporter named Doug played by Hanks \u2014 proved to be surprisingly adept at \u201cBlack Jeopardy.\u201d \n \n After Leslie Jones picked a category titled \u201cThey Out Here Saying,\u201d Kenan Thompson read the clue: \u201cThey out here saying that every vote counts.\u201d Hanks buzzed in and answered in a tight-jawed drawl: \u201cWhat is \u2018Come on, they already decided who wins even \u2019fore it happens.\u2019 \u201d \n \n \u201cYes!\u201d Thompson cried, as the studio audience cheered and the black contestants nodded in approval. \u201cMan, the Illuminati figured that out months ago!\u201d \n \n Historically, the sketch has embellished black stereotypes and mocked white people\u2019s political correctness. This time around, it found common ground between African Americans and rural white conservatives: a sense of disenfranchisement, a distrust of authorities and, more playfully, an appreciation of curvy women. \n \n Under the category \u201cBig Girls,\u201d Thompson read this clue: \u201cSkinny women can do this for you.\u201d \n \n \u201cWhat is \u2018Not a damn thing,\u2019 \u201d Hanks answered, again to wild cheers from the audience and a high-five from Leslie Jones. \u201cMy wife, she\u2019s a sturdy gal.\u201d \n \n \u201cThat is my man right there,\u201d Jones said. \n \n [\u2018I always get back up\u2019: Leslie Jones returns to social media after nasty hack] \n \n The sketch \u2014 written by \u201cWeekend Update\u201d co-anchor Michael Che and SNL co-head writer Bryan Tucker \u2014 was smart, funny and topical (a rare trifecta on SNL) and slyly illustrated that America\u2019s problems are just as much about class as about race.

Hilarious, sharp, and topical, it's the best comedic take on the current presidential election we've seen on TV this year. \n \n \"Black Jeopardy!\" has showed up on \"SNL\" before, usually playing up the cultural differences of contestants in a battle of stereotypes. That's true here, but in a Donald Trump-inspired way: Tom Hanks is the sole white contestant on the game show, wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat. \n \n But it turns out as the sketch goes on that the black contestants and host and the white Trump supporter have a lot in common: a distrust of authority and elections, a love of curvy women and Tyler Perry films, and an ability to get a good deal from their local \"guy.\" \n \n The delirious, cleverly written sketch insists that we're more alike than different as Americans. Until, that is, the biting final moment, when the final category shows up: \"Lives That Matter.\" The black contestants look at Hanks' Trump voter awkwardly, and he stares silently. \n \n \"It was good while it lasted,\" Kenan Thompson's host says. \n \n The sketch, written by \"Weekend Update\" co-anchor Michael Che and \"SNL\" co-head writer Bryan Tucker, leaves us to imagine what Hanks' character thinks about which lives matter, but it's a pointed jab at how class and race play important \u2014 and sometimes very different \u2014 roles in shaping attitudes and beliefs around the current presidential election, in which Trump has amassed support among working-class whites. \n \n Interestingly, the sketch also has fans broadly among political thinkers and writers. Fox News contributor Stacey Dash approves: \n \n As does a former Jeb Bush campaign staffer: \n \n Slate political writer Jamelle Bouie had some thoughts about the sketch's meaning: \n \n And the Washington Post summed it up by calling it \"SNL's best political sketch this year.\" \n \n Watch the full sketch below:",
    "reference": "\u2013 SNL may have opened Saturday's show with a spoof of the latest presidential debate, but it saved its best skit for later. A black host, two black contestants, a white guy named Doug wearing a \"Make America Great Again\" hat, get together for an episode of Black Jeopardy. But as Doug (Tom Hanks) answers various clues, the contestants (Sasheer Zamata and Leslie Jones) learn he isn't so different from them: He, too, has suspicions about the iPhone's thumbprint key and elections, as well as a love of curvy women, Tyler Perry, and lottery tickets. All goes well until the final category: \"Lives That Matter.\" \"It was good while it lasted,\" the host (Kenan Thompson) declares. What people are saying: Paul Schrodt at Business Insider credits Michael Che and Bryan Tucker for writing the show's \"best sketch in recent memory\" and \"the best comedic take on the current presidential election we've seen on TV this year.\" Dan Zak at the Washington Post calls it the \"best political sketch of the year.\" In previous shows, Black Jeopardy has \"embellished black stereotypes and mocked white people's political correctness,\" he writes. \"This time around, it found common ground between African Americans and rural white conservatives.\" \"Portraying the many subtleties of the American electorate in a sharp, hilarious, and different way this far into the campaign cycle is hard\u2014and like Doug on Black Jeopardy, SNL crushed it,\" writes Caroline Framke at Vox. Yes, the sketch \"is as good as everyone says it is,\" writes blogger Jason Kottke. \"And it's not just funny either\u2026 it's the rare SNL skit that works brilliantly as cultural commentary. Kudos to the writers on this one.\" But Crystal Wright has a very different take. \"If you like blacks being mocked for every stereotype under the sun, I guess you'll find the 6 minutes a real howl worth gittin' down wit,\" she writes at Mediaite."

But he stopped short of endorsing a far-reaching proposal, backed by the postal service, to allow the agency to claw back more than $50 billion that two independent actuaries have said the post office has overpaid into a major federal pension plan. Postal Service officials say such a move would go far to alleviate the agency\u2019s financial problems. \n \n Mr. Berry said the administration was studying the proposal, but not endorsing or opposing it at this point. \n \n He said the administration would release a more comprehensive proposal in coming weeks \u201cto ensure a sustainable future for the postal service,\u201d one that would be part of the broader $1.5 trillion deficit reduction package that the President Obama has promised to send to Congress. \n \n The post office\u2019s financial problems are complex. Mail volume has been steadily declining, and the agency has been unable to cut its labor costs or reduce services quickly enough to match the fall in revenue. At the same time, the post office faces legal constraints that prevent it from diversifying into new lines of business, and it is also barred from raising postage prices faster than the rate of inflation. \n \n Photo \n \n Mr. Berry noted that the Obama administration did support the postal service\u2019s push to recover $7 billion that officials agree was overpaid into yet another pension fund. But he expressed serious reservations about the postal service\u2019s plan to cut costs by moving postal workers into a new, supposedly cheaper health insurance plan. \n \n The two senators most active on postal issues \u2014 Thomas Carper , a Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the subcommittee overseeing the post office, and Susan Collins of Maine , who is the ranking Republican on the governmental affairs committee \u2014 criticized the Obama administration for not acting more quickly and decisively to address the post office\u2019s problems. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cThe proposals put forward by the administration to date have been insufficient,\u201d Mr. Carper said. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The post office hopes to use much of $50 billion in claimed pension overpayments to cover those annual health care payments. \n \n Cliff Guffey, president of the American Postal Workers Union, one of the four postal unions, denounced the post office\u2019s proposal to lay off 120,000 workers. The agency has asked Congress to pass a special law overturning no-layoff provisions in its union contracts. Some of those contracts bar the layoff of any workers with more than six years on the job. \n \n \u201cThese proposals are outrageous, illegal and despicable,\u201d Mr. Guffey said. \n \n He said his union had agreed to $3.7 billion in savings in a contract signed in May to help the postal service cut costs. In return, the union preserved its longstanding job-protection provisions. \u201cTo unilaterally abrogate what we gained is totally contrary to the duty to bargain collectively,\u201d he said. \n \n An overarching trend that has fueled the Postal Service\u2019s crisis \u2014 and reduced annual mail volume by 22 percent since 2006 \u2014 is that Americans are e-mailing, paying bills electronically and reading shopping catalogs and news online. \n \n Noting that some great books have been written based on letters sent by the Founding Fathers and by soldiers, Senator Claire McCaskill , Democrat of Missouri , urged the postmaster general to run an advertising campaign urging Americans to send more letters to each other. \n \n \u201cThere is something special about receiving a piece of first-class mail, knowing that it comes from someone you care about,\u201d she said. \u201cI really believe that if someone would begin to market the value of sending a written letter to someone you love, you might be surprised what it will do for your Christmas season.\u201d ||||| The Obama administration will include a financial blueprint for the nearly bankrupt U.S. Postal Service (USPS) in a deficit-reduction package that will be submitted to Congress, an administration official told lawmakers Tuesday. \n \n With the Postal Service speeding toward default, John Berry, the director of the Office of Personnel Management, also said the administration would like to delay the deadline USPS faces for a massive benefits payment by 90 days. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n Berry said the extra time would allow the White House, Congress and Postal Service to find a path forward for the agency. \n \n \u201cBoth the president and I know of the critical importance to our nation\u2019s economy that the Postal Service provides,\u201d Berry said at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee. \n \n Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe said at the same hearing that pushing the $5.5 billion payment for future retiree healthcare costs back to the end of the year would give USPS some financial breathing room. \n \n But he also reiterated that the service would default on the payment regardless of the deadline \u2014 and that, with technological advancements continuing to eat into its bottom line, USPS needed to radically restructure its business model, with some help from Congress. \n \n If changes are not made, Donahoe told reporters, \u201cwe think that around the August, September time frame next year we would be out of cash.\u201d \n \n The Postal Service is fast approaching its borrowing limit of $15 billion, leaving officials concerned about a first-ever USPS default. Donahoe told the Senate panel that the Postal Service\u2019s net loss for this fiscal year could run as high as $10 billion, and projects to around $9 billion for next year. \n \n USPS, which does not use taxpayer revenue for operations, also expects to handle 167 billion pieces of mail this year, 22 percent less than it did in 2006. Officials say the economic struggles of the last five years are at least partly to blame for that decline, but admit that the increasing ability to communicate and pay bills online is a major factor as well. \n \n Lawmakers at Tuesday\u2019s hearing appeared to see a USPS overhaul as a potential area for bipartisanship in the aftermath of the polarizing debt-ceiling debate. \n \n \u201cAre we going to fight about the Post Office, too?\u201d Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.) asked. \n \n Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.), the chairman of the Homeland Security panel, said during the hearing that lawmakers would not be able to act as quickly as Donahoe had wanted.

But he also drew Collins\u2019s ire after noting that the White House did not have a formal opinion on other potential fixes. \n \n \u201cI just don\u2019t understand why the administration doesn\u2019t have a concrete plan to put before us today, given the dire straits that we\u2019re in,\u201d the Maine Republican said. \n \n Donahoe, meanwhile, appeared satisfied with the progress Congress was making, even though it seems unlikely lawmakers will work through four separate proposed overhauls of the service by the end of September. \n \n \u201cWe appreciate all the attention, and want to work together with both parties to get this rolling,\u201d he said.",

    "input": "TEMPLE CITY, California (Reuters) - A Japanese American man thought to be the reclusive multi-millionaire father of Bitcoin emerged from a modest Southern California home and denied involvement with the digital currency before leading reporters on a freeway car chase to the local headquarters of the Associated Press. \n \n Satoshi Nakamoto is surrounded by reporters as he leaves his home in Temple City, California, March 6, 2014. REUTERS/David McNew \n \n Satoshi Nakamoto, a name known to legions of bitcoin traders, practitioners and boosters around the world, appeared to lose his anonymity on Thursday after Newsweek published a story that said he lived in Temple City, California, just east of Los Angeles. \n \n Newsweek included a photograph and described a short interview, in which Nakamoto said he was no longer associated with Bitcoin and that it had been turned over to other people. The magazine concluded that the man was the same Nakamoto who founded Bitcoin. \n \n Dozens of reporters, including a sprinkling of Japanese media, encircled and camped outside the man\u2019s two-story house on Thursday morning, accosting the mailman and repeatedly ringing the doorbell, to no avail. Police cruisers drove by several times but did not stop. \n \n Several times, someone pulled back the drapes on an upstairs window. \n \n In the afternoon, the silver-haired, bespectacled Nakamoto stepped outside, dressed in a gray sport coat and green striped shirt, with a pen tucked in his shirt pocket. He was mobbed by reporters and told them he was looking for someone who understood Japanese to buy him a free lunch. \n \n Newsweek estimates his wealth at $400 million. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m not involved in Bitcoin. Wait a minute, I want my free lunch first. I\u2019m going with this guy,\u201d Nakamoto said, pointing at a reporter from AP. \u201cI\u2019m not in Bitcoin, I don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d he said again while walking down the street with several cameras at his heels. \n \n He and the AP reporter made their way to a nearby sushi restaurant with media in tow, before leaving and heading downtown. Los Angeles Times reporter Joe Bel Bruno followed the pair and described the chase in a running stream of tweets. Eventually, the pair dashed into the Associated Press offices in downtown Los Angeles. \n \n MISUNDERSTOOD \n \n In a later AP interview, Nakamoto said he was misunderstood in a key portion of the Newsweek story, where he tells the reporter on his doorstep, \u201cI am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it.\u201d \n \n Related Coverage Bitcoin true believers unfazed by losses in Mt. Gox collapse \n \n Asked by the AP if he had said that, Nakamoto said, \u201cNo.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m saying I\u2019m no longer in engineering. That\u2019s it,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cAnd even if I was, when we get hired, you have to sign this document, contract saying you will not reveal anything we divulge during and after employment. So that\u2019s what I implied.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt sounded like I was involved before with Bitcoin and looked like I\u2019m not involved now. That\u2019s not what I meant. I want to clarify that,\u201d the AP reported him as saying. \n \n The Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group promoting the adoption of the digital currency, said \u201c... We have seen zero conclusive evidence that the identified person is the designer of Bitcoin.\u201d \n \n \u201cThose closest to the Bitcoin project, the informal team of core developers, have always been unaware of Nakamoto\u2019s true identity, as Nakamoto communicated purely through electronic means,\u201d it said in a post on its website. \n \n Newsweek writer Leah McGrath Goodman told the AP that she stood by her story. \u201cI stand completely by my exchange with Mr. Nakamoto. There was no confusion whatsoever about the context of our conversation - and his acknowledgment of his involvement in Bitcoin.\u201d \n \n \u201cFOCUSED AND ECLECTIC\u201d \n \n Fans see Bitcoin as a digital-world currency beyond government interference, while critics, whose ranks swelled with the recent bankruptcy filing by major bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, see a risky investment whose anonymity aids drug dealers and other criminals. \n \n Nakamoto kept a low profile in part to avoid the attention of authorities, Newsweek said. On Thursday, the office of Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of New York\u2019s Department of Financial Services, was keen on speaking with him, a source familiar with the situation told Reuters. \n \n Bitcoin is bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of central control. Its value soared last year, and the total worth of bitcoins minted is now about $7 billion. \n \n In the Newsweek article, Nakamoto was credited by Bitcoin\u2019s chief scientist, Gavin Andresen, in working out the first codes behind the currency. \n \n Slideshow (3 Images) \n \n A man of few words who refused to discuss anything beyond the currency or even communicate outside of email, Nakamoto was described by his brother in the Newsweek article as \u201cfickle and has very weird hobbies,\u201d including a penchant for model trains. \n \n Japanese-born Nakamoto displayed an unusual aptitude for math as a child. He immigrated with his mother to California in 1959. He worked for defense and electronics company Hughes Aircraft, but never discussed work because much of it was classified, according to Newsweek interviews with several friends and relatives. \n \n \u201cHe\u2019s very focused and eclectic in his way of thinking. Smart, intelligent, mathematics, engineering, computers. You name it, he can do it,\u201d Newsweek quoted Arthur Nakamoto, his younger brother, as saying. ||||| The day started with a possible answer to one of the digital era's greatest mysteries: Who created the bitcoin virtual currency that has become a multibillion-dollar global phenomenon? \n \n From there, with the unlikely revelation by Newsweek magazine that it might be Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto, a 64-year-old Japanese American living in Temple City, the day only got wilder and weirder. \n \n It featured a media frenzy on his front lawn and a semi-comical car chase through multiple cities as Nakamoto rode in a Prius driven by an Associated Press reporter trying to elude other reporters. And then, a denial from Nakamoto \u2014 as he climbed into an elevator at the downtown AP offices \u2014 that he was the creator of bitcoin. \n \n \"I never was involved,\" he said to a Times reporter, saying there was only one reason he had agreed to even talk to a reporter. \"It was all for a free lunch.\" \n \n Really? \n \n Like so many other elements of the day, the off-the-cuff remarks hinted at some finality but in truth only contributed to the murkiness surrounding the true identity of \"Satoshi Nakamoto,\" the mastermind behind bitcoin. Indeed, the story published by Newsweek on Thursday sparked an angry backlash among members of the bitcoin community, with some vowing retribution against the reporter and others insisting that she had the wrong man. \n \n \"He always used non-tracking emails and did everything he could to stay anonymous, so it's difficult for me to understand why he would use his real name,\" said Adam Draper, who runs a start-up that invests in bitcoin-related companies. \n \n In a 2008 memo titled \"Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,\" \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" laid out the details for a new virtual currency. Rather than relying on banks and other financial middlemen, bitcoins would rely on a cryptographic protocol to ensure its value, security and anonymity. \n \n Users would have to \"mine\" coins by solving complex mathematical problems. They could then buy and sell them through various exchanges. Initially, it was embraced by hackers and anarchists who loved the idea of a currency free from government or corporate control. \n \n But over time, bitcoins created a frenzy as their value skyrocketed, making many of the original bitcoin members quite wealthy. \n \n They also moved closer to mainstream acceptance as a growing number of businesses began accepting them and entrepreneurs and venture capitalists created an expanding economy of bitcoin-related companies. \n \n Bitcoins have also generated controversy, with U.S. agencies breaking up a notorious online black market in which users used the currency to buy drugs and guns. Last month, one of the largest and oldest bitcoin exchanges announced that hackers had stolen more than $450 million worth of bitcoins, forcing it to file for bankruptcy. \n \n Along the way, Nakamoto never stepped forward to claim credit. And, in fact, a couple years ago, he withdrew from the bitcoin community completely, leaving others to carry on the work of developing the system and wonder about his real identity, which remained shrouded in mystery. \n \n Until Thursday. \n \n Following a trail of clues over several months, Newsweek reporter Leah McGrath Goodman believed she had tracked down the real bitcoin creator. The article said Satoshi Nakamoto was not a fake name, as many had assumed, but his real one \u2014 just one of many strange twists. \n \n In part, she said she found him by discovering he had a hobby of collecting model trains, \n \n Fred Hill, the owner of Original Whistle-Stop Trains in Pasadena, said in an interview with The Times on Thursday that Nakamoto has been a regular since Hill bought the business in 1976. \n \n Nakamoto, a skilled machinist who builds all of his train layouts from scratch, is highly sociable and \"a lot of fun,\" Hill said. Nakamoto will chat extensively about trains, particularly steam engines. In the shop, he always goes by his adopted first name, Dorian. \n \n \"He's not a disheveled, spacey individual at all,\" Hill said. \"He's not an eccentric. He's a very intelligent man.\" \n \n The Newsweek story also said he had a career in technology that included some classified work for major corporations and U.S. defense agencies. He has been separated from his wife for more than a decade. And much of what he did for a living over the past decade was unclear. Nakamoto's modest home surprised the reporter because the real bitcoin creator owns about $400 million in bitcoins.",
    "reference": "\u2013 The man \"unmasked\" as the founder of bitcoin by Newsweek says he'd never even heard of the virtual currency until reporters tracked his son down a couple of weeks ago.

It was named after Elie Wiesel, a fellow recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize and a Holocaust survivor who was one of the museum\u2019s founders. Mr. Wiesel was the first recipient. \n \n The award, according to the museum, is given annually \u201cto an internationally prominent individual whose actions have advanced the Museum\u2019s vision of a world where people confront hatred, prevent genocide and promote human dignity.\u201d ||||| Press Contacts Andrew Hollinger \n \n Director, Communications \n \n 202.488.6133 \n \n ahollinger@ushmm.org Museum Press Kit \n \n March 6, 2018 \n \n State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi \n \n via H.E. Ambassador Aung Lynn \n \n Embassy of Myanmar \n \n 2300 S Street, NW \n \n Washington, DC, 20008 \n \n Dear State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, \n \n As a living memorial to the Holocaust, the Museum\u2019s mission is to inspire citizens and leaders worldwide to confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity. Preventing genocide is at the core of our work every day. Based on inspiration that you created for millions around the world, with your long resistance to military dictatorship, and your advocacy for freedom and human rights for all the people of Myanmar, we were honored to present you with the first Elie Wiesel Award in 2012. It is with great regret that we are now rescinding that award. We did not take this decision lightly. \n \n In recent years, the Museum has been closely monitoring the military\u2019s campaign against the Rohingya and your response to it. In November 2013, we held a public event at the Museum to call attention to our growing concerns, titled: \u201cOur Walls Bear Witness: The Plight of Burma\u2019s Rohingya.\u201d Since that time, we have undertaken numerous visits to Myanmar and Bangladesh to obtain firsthand evidence so that we can fully understand the extent of the persecution and crimes committed, as well as the motivations and actions of all the responsible parties. \n \n In May 2015, we published \u201cThey Want Us All to Go Away,\u201d which documented the early warning signs of genocide. Last November, we released detailed findings based on research on the ground documenting crimes against humanity, ethnic cleansing, and what we termed \u201cmounting evidence of genocide\u201d committed by the Myanmar military against Rohingya civilians since October 2016. Regrettably over the last five years the situation has become progressively worse and today seems untenable for the Rohingya population. \n \n As the military\u2019s attacks against the Rohingya unfolded in 2016 and 2017, we had hoped that you\u2014as someone we and many others have celebrated for your commitment to human dignity and universal human rights\u2014would have done something to condemn and stop the military\u2019s brutal campaign and to express solidarity with the targeted Rohingya population. \n \n The National League for Democracy, under your leadership, has instead refused to cooperate with United Nations investigators, promulgated hateful rhetoric against the Rohingya community, and denied access to and cracked down on journalists trying to uncover the scope of the crimes in Rakhine State. \n \n We understand the difficult situation you must face in confronting decades of military misrule and violence in your country and that institution\u2019s still powerful constitutional role. However, the military\u2019s orchestration of the crimes against Rohingya and the severity of the atrocities in recent months demand that you use your moral authority to address this situation. While Myanmar has taken important first steps on the road to democracy, any transition that does not protect the country\u2019s most vulnerable communities will be deeply flawed. \n \n As we have said in the past, we urge you to use your unique standing and your official role as State Counsellor and Foreign Minister to cooperate with international efforts, such as the Fact-Finding Mission mandated by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the work of the Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in Myanmar, to establish the truth about the atrocities committed in Rakhine State and secure accountability for perpetrators. \n \n We also urge you to lead an effort to review and amend the 1982 Citizenship Law, which has rendered most Rohingya stateless, so that it is aligned with international standards and allows equal access to full citizenship rights regardless of ethnicity. You can expand access for both local and international aid workers to administer life-saving assistance. Finally, we urge you to condemn the hateful, dehumanizing language directed toward the Rohingya. \n \n As a living memorial to the victims of the Holocaust, the Museum stands in solidarity with victims of genocide and atrocity crimes and attempts to do for victims today what was not done for the Jews of Europe. As Elie Wiesel said, \u201cNeutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormenter, never the tormented.\u201d \n \n Sincerely, \n \n Sara J.

In what the New York Times calls \"perhaps the strongest rebuke yet,\" the museum on Tuesday informed Aung San Suu Kyi in a letter that it was stripping her of the award due to her response\u2014or non-response, as she has yet to publicly say the word \"Rohingya\"\u2014to Myanmar's ethnic cleansing of the Rohingya. The letter explains the museum has been \"closely monitoring the military's campaign against the Rohingya and your response to it,\" and that it began publicly airing its concerns about what was happening to the Rohingya in 2013; subsequent visits to Myanmar and Bangladesh have followed. \"We had hoped that you\u2014as someone we and many others have celebrated for your commitment to human dignity and universal human rights\u2014would have done something to condemn and stop the military's brutal campaign and to express solidarity with the targeted Rohingya population,\" the letter continues.

    "input": "\u201cYour honor, we don\u2019t know if the suspect is the killer, but we do know they both used Revlon Frost & Glow hair dye.\u201d It sounds absurd, but a well-known chemistry technique could help authorities identify criminals based on their artificial hair color. Usually, hairs left behind at a crime scene are associated with DNA testing, but such a procedure requires whole, intact hairs and is often time-consuming. Because of these constraints, forensic analyses sometimes simply compare the appearance of the hair under the microscope, but these comparisons are subjective in nature and frequently inconclusive. However, new research, published online in Analytical Chemistry, might eventually provide police with a DNA-free method for objectively linking a hair to a crime. The technique uses surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) to precisely measure how light from a laser bounces off a hair. Vibrations within the molecules on the hair\u2019s surface change the energy of the reflected photons and are caught by a detector. If the sample has a dye on it (or blood, drugs, ink, explosives, etc.) the laser will reflect differently, and each dye creates a unique pattern. The technique is so precise that scientists are able to identify distinct brands of dye and determine whether the dye was temporary or permanent\u2014even when sampling a microscopic piece of hair. Furthermore, because SERS is fast and doesn\u2019t destroy the sample, if a chemical does link a hair to a crime scene, the sample could potentially still be analyzed for DNA at a later point. ||||| Criminals with a penchant for dyeing their hair could soon pay for their vanity. Scientists have found a way to analyze hair samples at crime scenes to rapidly determine whether it was colored and what brand of dye was used. Their report appears in the ACS journal Analytical Chemistry. \n \n Richard P. Van Duyne and Dmitry Kurouski note that analyzing hairs for forensic investigations, despite what TV shows would have you believe, can be a labor-intensive and flawed process. Testing samples for DNA requires an intact bulb or root, which isn't always present. Plus, the procedure is time-consuming, which can cause a large backlog of cases. So investigators will often opt to use the more traditional method of visually comparing hair from a crime scene with samples from suspects using a microscope. But this technique doesn't necessarily provide conclusive results. Van Duyne and Kurouski wanted to find a more practical and accurate way to analyze hair. \n \n The researchers turned to surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with a portable Raman spectrometer. SERS can detect minute amounts of illicit drugs, explosives, gunshot residue and body fluids. With this method, the team could rapidly confirm whether hair samples, even microscopic ones, were dyed and what brand of colorant was used. This highly sensitive technique could help forensic investigators analyze hair quickly in the field, the researchers say. \n \n ### \n \n The American Chemical Society is a nonprofit organization chartered by the U.S. Congress. With more than 158,000 members, ACS is the world's largest scientific society and a global leader in providing access to chemistry-related research through its multiple databases, peer-reviewed journals and scientific conferences.

    "reference": "\u2013 If you dye your hair and plan on committing a crime, be warned: A new procedure allows scientists to determine if a single microscopic hair has been dyed, if that dye was permanent or temporary, and even what brand of dye was used. Scientists used surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, or SERS, to gauge how light reflects off a hair. Essentially, molecules on the hair's surface begin to vibrate and \"change the energy of the reflected photons,\" Science reports. In other words, the light reads differently depending on the dye on a sample. Not only does the technique register hair dye, scientists say it also finds small amounts of body fluids like blood, drugs, explosives, and gunshot residue, according to a study in Analytical Chemistry. Why all the fuss if scientists can perform DNA testing? For one thing, an intact bulb or root must be present in the hair sample in order for it to be analyzed for DNA, a press release notes. For another, DNA testing can be a lengthy process and the cases quickly pile up. In many cases, scientists resort to comparing a sample hair with that of a suspect under a microscope, a method that can prove both impractical and inconclusive. The SERS method is quick, easy, doesn't damage the sample, \"and can be performed directly at the crime scene\" using a portable Raman spectrometer, the study authors write. Another bonus: SERS' gentle approach means a key piece of hair can still be examined for DNA afterward. (Pubic hairs could help identify criminals, too.)"

    "input": "Google has been condemned for supporting state censorship following reports that it is working on a mobile search app that would block certain search terms and allow it to reenter the Chinese market. \n \n The California-based internet company has engineers designing search software that would leave out content blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to a New York Times report citing two unnamed people familiar with the matter. Such blacklisting would allow the company to reverse its move out of the country eight years ago due to censorship and hacking. \n \n China censored Google's AlphaGo match against world's best Go player Read more \n \n The Intercept news website first reported the story, saying the Chinese search app was being tailored for the Google-backed Android operating system for mobile devices. The service was said to have been shown to Chinese officials. \n \n Google did not respond to a request for comment. The state-owned China Securities Daily, citing information from \u201crelevant departments\u201d, denied the report. \n \n As well as the search app, Google is reportedly building a second app, focused on news aggregation, for the Chinese market, which would also comply with the country\u2019s censorship laws, according to the Information tech news site. The news app would take its lead from popular algorithmically-curated apps such as Bytedance\u2019s Toutiao \u2013 released for the western market as TopBuzz \u2013 that eschew human editors in favour of personalised, highly viral content. \n \n There was no guarantee the project, codenamed Dragonfly, would result in Google search returning to China. Google already offers a number of apps to Chinese users, including Google Translate and Files Go, and the company has offices in Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai. But the largest of its services \u2013 search, email and the Play app store \u2013 are all unavailable. \n \n Google\u2019s co-founder Sergey Brin has previously cited his birth in the Soviet Union in the 1970s as explaining his opposition to enabling Chinese censorship. \u201cIt touches me more than other people having been born in a country that was totalitarian and having seen that for the first few years of my life,\u201d he told the Guardian in 2010, as Google pulled its censorship from Chinese search after four years of cooperating with the authorities. \n \n The Chinese human rights community said Google\u2019s acquiescence to China\u2019s censorship would be a \u201cdark day for internet freedom\u201d. \n \n \u201cIt is impossible to see how such a move is compatible with Google\u2019s \u2018do the right thing\u2019 motto and we are calling on the company to change course,\u201d said Patrick Poon, China researcher for Amnesty International. \u201cFor the world\u2019s biggest search engine to adopt such extreme measures would be a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom. In putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent and handing the Chinese government a victory.\u201d \n \n GreatFire, a China-based organisation that monitors internet censorship and provides ways around the \u201cgreat firewall\u201d for Chinese residents, said the move \u201ccould be the final nail in the Chinese internet freedom coffin\u201d and that \u201cthe ensuing crackdown on freedom of speech will be felt around the globe\u201d. \n \n Speaking to the Guardian in 2016, GreatFire\u2019s co-founder \u201cCharlie Smith\u201d \u2013 a pseudonym \u2013 had praised Google\u2019s initial decision to pull out of China in 2010 over what it said were cyber-attacks aimed at its source code and the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists. \n \n \u201cI think people are going to be very wary and attentive to how Google goes back into China. And hopefully they\u2019re going to show us that there is a way to go back in without having to censor,\u201d Smith said at the time. \n \n \n \n \u201cI would be disappointed, and I know that a lot of other people would be disappointed, if Google went back in and said \u2018we\u2019re going to censor our search results again\u2019, because they\u2019ve made that mistake already, and they should understand that the situation hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d \n \n Agence France-Presse contributed to this report ||||| Google is reportedly planning to get back into China, a lucrative market where it has a long history of tangling with authorities. \n \n The Intercept reported Wednesday that Google plans to launch a search app in China that would block sensitive websites and search terms to comply with Chinese government censorship. \n \n China has hundreds of millions of internet users and a thriving online shopping market, making it impossible for US tech companies to ignore. But jumping back into China presents ethical issues for Google (GOOGL), which has long advocated a free and open internet. \n \n Andy Tian, a tech executive who formerly led mobile strategy and partnerships for Google in China, said the Chinese tech companies that currently dominate search can't compete with Google's product. \n \n \"There's a huge void, Google can fill that void,\" said Tian, who is now CEO of Asia Innovations. \n \n Asked about The Intercept report, Google said in a statement that \"we don't comment on speculation about future plans.\" \n \n Related: Google's latest move to crack China: A WeChat game \n \n Like many other US internet platforms, Google's most popular products \u2014 search, YouTube, Gmail \u2014 have been banned in China for years, blacked out by a vast government censorship apparatus known as the Great Firewall. \n \n But that wasn't always the case. \n \n Google China 1.0 \n \n Google launched a Chinese language version of its search engine \u2014 google.cn \u2014 in 2006. It complied with Beijing's censorship laws. \n \n \"While removing search results is inconsistent with Google's mission, providing no information (or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information) is more inconsistent with our mission,\" Google said at the time. \n \n Related: Google to censor itself in China \n \n While the search engine was censored, it also flagged to users when information was removed from results. That gave Chinese internet users an idea of what they were not allowed to see. \n \n \"We reminded users in China every single day that they are looking at filtered results,\" said Tian, who worked at Google when the search engine launched. \n \n Still, critics complained that Google was breaching its own company motto: \"Don't Be Evil.\" \n \n The company's devotion to web freedom, critics charged, was being subverted by a willingness to comply with Chinese censorship in return for access to a huge potential customer base. \n \n Attack and retreat \n \n Google was battling Baidu (BIDU) for market share. Three years after launch, Google had wrestled about a third of the search market away from its Chinese rival. \n \n The dynamic changed in January 2010, when Google charged that Chinese hackers had targeted Google and more than 20 other Western companies and compromised the email accounts of Chinese dissidents living abroad. \n \n Beijing denied that it had been involved in the attacks, but the incident sparked a political fight with Washington. \n \n Related: Google quits censoring search in China \n \n About three months later, Google made good on a threat to stop offering search in China. \n \n In March 2010, it announced it had stopped running the censored Google.cn service and began routing its Chinese users to an uncensored version of Google based in Hong Kong. \n \n Academics, university students and other researchers relied heavily on Google's search services to access information not available through Chinese search engines like Baidu. \n \n Businesses that depended on Google applications such as Google Docs and Gmail also suffered. \n \n Google wants back behind the Firewall \n \n Google's parent company Alphabet changed its motto in 2015, replacing \"Don't Be Evil\" with \"Do the Right Thing.\" \n \n From a business perspective, getting back into China is the right thing for Google. It currently offers just a few services in the country \u2014 Google Translate, a file organizing program and a new AI game. \n \n Advertising is Google's main source of revenue, and 1.4 billion potential users are hard to ignore. Facebook (FB), which competes with Google for advertising revenue, is also locked out of China. \n \n Shares in Baidu (BIDU) dropped 8% on Wednesday after The Intercept report was published. \n \n Related: Google bets $550M on Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com \n \n Critics and human rights groups are already accusing Google of bending to China's will. \n \n \"The reality is that they will be serving the Chinese government,\" said Lokman Tsui, former head of free expression for Google in Asia. \n \n \"The government now tracks people, apps on phones reveal who you are, where you are. They are intrusive,\" he added. \"They collect much more data and Google can be requested to handover these data to the government.\" \n \n \u2014 Begona Blanco Munoz contributed reporting. ||||| HONG KONG \u2014 Google withdrew from China eight years ago to protest the country\u2019s censorship and online hacking. Now, the internet giant is working on a censored search engine for China that will filter websites and search terms that are blacklisted by the Chinese government, according to two people with knowledge of the plans. \n \n Google has teams of engineers working on a search app that restricts content banned by Beijing, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not permitted to speak publicly about the project. The company has demonstrated the service to Chinese government officials, they added. \n \n Yet the existence of the project does not mean that Google\u2019s return to China is imminent, the people cautioned. Google often builds and tests different services that never become publicly available. \n \n Google\u2019s reversal in China, which was reported earlier by The Intercept, is the latest example of how American tech companies are trying to tailor their products to enter the huge Chinese market, even if it means tamping down free speech. LinkedIn censors content in China, for example. And Facebook developed software to suppress certain posts from appearing on the social network, with the aim of potentially deploying it in China, though there was no indication it was offered to Chinese authorities. ||||| The planned move represents a dramatic shift in Google\u2019s policy on China and will mark the first time in almost a decade that the internet giant has operated its search engine in the country. \n \n Teams of programmers and engineers at Google have created a custom Android app, different versions of which have been named \u201cMaotai\u201d and \u201cLongfei.\u201d The app has already been demonstrated to the Chinese government; the finalized version could be launched in the next six to nine months, pending approval from Chinese officials. \n \n The project \u2013 code-named Dragonfly \u2013 has been underway since spring of last year, and accelerated following a December 2017 meeting between Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai and a top Chinese government official, according to internal Google documents and people familiar with the plans. \n \n Google is planning to launch a censored version of its search engine in China that will blacklist websites and search terms about human rights, democracy, religion, and peaceful protest, The Intercept can reveal. \n \n Google\u2019s search service cannot currently be accessed by most internet users in China because it is blocked by the country\u2019s so-called Great Firewall. The app Google is building for China will comply with the country\u2019s strict censorship laws, restricting access to content that Xi Jinping\u2019s Communist Party regime deems unfavorable. \n \n The Chinese government blocks information on the internet about political opponents, free speech, sex, news, and academic studies. It bans websites about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, for instance, and references to \u201canticommunism\u201d and \u201cdissidents.\u201d Mentions of books that negatively portray authoritarian governments, like George Orwell\u2019s 1984 and Animal Farm, have been prohibited on Weibo, a Chinese social media website. The country also censors popular Western social media sites like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, as well as American news organizations such as the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal. \n \n Documents seen by The Intercept, marked \u201cGoogle confidential,\u201d say that Google\u2019s Chinese search app will automatically identify and filter websites blocked by the Great Firewall. When a person carries out a search, banned websites will be removed from the first page of results, and a disclaimer will be displayed stating that \u201csome results may have been removed due to statutory requirements.\u201d Examples cited in the documents of websites that will be subject to the censorship include those of British news broadcaster BBC and the online encyclopedia Wikipedia. \n \n The search app will \u201cblacklist sensitive queries.\u201d \n \n The search app will also \u201cblacklist sensitive queries\u201d so that \u201cno results will be shown\u201d at all when people enter certain words or phrases, the documents state. The censorship will apply across the platform: Google\u2019s image search, automatic spell check and suggested search features will incorporate the blacklists, meaning that they will not recommend people information or photographs the government has banned. \n \n Within Google, knowledge about Dragonfly has been restricted to just a few hundred members of the internet giant\u2019s 88,000-strong workforce, said a source with knowledge of the project. The source spoke to The Intercept on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to contact the media. The source said that they had moral and ethical concerns about Google\u2019s role in the censorship, which is being planned by a handful of top executives and managers at the company with no public scrutiny. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m against large companies and governments collaborating in the oppression of their people, and feel like transparency around what\u2019s being done is in the public interest,\u201d the source said, adding that they feared \u201cwhat is done in China will become a template for many other nations.\u201d \n \n Patrick Poon, a Hong Kong-based researcher with human rights group Amnesty International, told The Intercept that Google\u2019s decision to comply with the censorship would be \u201ca big disaster for the information age.\u201d \n \n \u201cThis has very serious implications not just for China, but for all of us, for freedom of information and internet freedom,\u201d said Poon. \u201cIt will set a terrible precedent for many other companies who are still trying to do business in China while maintaining the principles of not succumbing to China\u2019s censorship. The biggest search engine in the world obeying the censorship in China is a victory for the Chinese government \u2013 it sends a signal that nobody will bother to challenge the censorship any more.\u201d \n \n \u201cI\u2019m against large companies and governments collaborating in the oppression of their people.\u201d \n \n It is unclear whether Google will eventually launch a desktop version of its censored China search platform. For now, the company is focused on initially rolling out the Android app, which a large portion of China\u2019s population will be able to access. Researchers estimate that more than 95 percent of people accessing the internet in China use mobile devices to go online, and Android is by far the most popular mobile operating system in the country, with 80 percent of the market share. \n \n The documents seen by The Intercept suggest that Google will operate the search app as part of a \u201cjoint venture\u201d with an unnamed partner company, which will presumably be based in China. However, much of the work on the Dragonfly project is being carried out at Google\u2019s Mountain View headquarters in California, about 14 miles northwest of San Jose, the heart of Silicon Valley. Other teams participating in the project are based out of Google offices in New York, San Francisco, Sunnyvale, Santa Barbara, Cambridge, Washington, D.C., Shanghai, Beijing, and Tokyo. \n \n Previously, between 2006 and 2010, Google had maintained a censored version of its search engine in China. At the time, the company faced severe criticism in the U.S. over its compliance with the Chinese government\u2019s policies. \n \n During a February 2006 congressional hearing that focused on the activities of American technology companies in China, members of the House International Relations Committee called Google a \u201cfunctionary of the Chinese government\u201d and accused it of \u201cabhorrent actions\u201d for participating in censorship. \u201cGoogle has seriously compromised its \u2018don\u2019t be evil\u2019 policy,\u201d declared Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J. \u201cIndeed, it has become evil\u2019s accomplice.\u201d \n \n The controversy eventually became too much for Google. In March 2010, it announced that it was pulling its search service out of China. In a blog post published at the time, the company cited Chinese government efforts to limit free speech, block websites, and hack Google computer systems as reasons why it \u201ccould no longer continue censoring our results.\u201d \n \n Sergey Brin, Google\u2019s co-founder, was born in the Soviet Union and seemed particularly sensitive to concerns around censorship, having had personal experience under a repressive regime. After Google ceased its search service in 2010, Brin said that the company\u2019s objection related to \u201cforces of totalitarianism,\u201d and added that he hoped the decision to pull the search platform out of the country would help lead to a \u201cmore open internet.\u201d \n \n \u201cCompanies operating in China must be prepared to turn over user data to security agencies.\u201d \n \n Since then, however, censorship and surveillance in China has become more pervasive. In 2016, the country\u2019s government passed a new cybersecurity law, which Human Rights Watch said \u201cstrengthens censorship, surveillance, and other controls over the internet.\u201d The government is using new automated systems to monitor and censor the internet, and it has cracked down on privacy technologies that Chinese people were using to circumvent the restrictions. \n \n \u201cIt has been a requirement that companies operating in China must be prepared to police their users and turn over user data to security agencies upon request,\u201d said Ron Deibert, director of Citizen Lab, an internet research group based at the University of Toronto. \u201cWe have also found overall that internet censorship [in China] is evolving towards less transparency, with less notification to users when messages are censored or removed across all platforms.\u201d \n \n Despite the continued repression, opinions have changed at the highest levels of Google. China now has more than 750 million internet users, equivalent to the entire population of Europe. It therefore represents a potentially massive revenue stream for the internet giant, which is likely a factor in its decision to relaunch the search platform in the country. ||||| Google is developing a news-aggregation app for use in China that will comply with the country\u2019s strict censorship laws, part of a plan to re-enter the world\u2019s largest internet market in the near future, according to three people familiar with the project. \n \n Google has been working on the app since last year and had been meeting with Chinese regulators to discuss the project, the people said. It is also preparing a mobile app for internet search in China that will comply with local censorship laws, an effort first reported Wednesday by The Intercept. The projects are part of an initiative code-named Dragonfly that marks a reversal for Google, which shut down its search engine in China eight years ago in dramatic fashion due to a growing crackdown on internet content by government authorities.",
    "reference": "\u2013 Google is looking to reenter the Chinese market it exited in protest over government censorship in a move critics say is nothing short of hypocritical. According to the Information and Intercept, Google has presented to Chinese officials two mobile apps\u2014one for internet searches, one focusing on news aggregation\u2014that would block content blacklisted by the government. It's a savvy business move in a lucrative market of over 750 million users, dominated by search engine Baidu. Yet it recalls Google's 2010 exit from China over the same government censorship its latest efforts would reportedly support. Co-founder Sergey Brin specifically cited totalitarian governments when pulling the Chinese service, though the company had said in 2006 that \"removing search results\" was better than \"providing no information,\" per CNN. Google, which already has translation and file management apps available in China, had notified Chinese users that their search results were being censored. It's unclear if the apps now in development would do the same, as Google refused to comment \"on speculation about future plans.\" (The state-owned China Securities Daily denies the report, per the Guardian.) But \"in putting profits before human rights, Google would be setting a chilling precedent\" with what Amnesty International sees as \"a gross attack on freedom of information and internet freedom,\" reports the Guardian. \"We don't need a second Baidu,\" a Chinese data researcher adds, per the New York Times, which adds that Google's own employees have quit or refused to work on the apps, which they apparently think flouts the company's own motto: \"Do the right thing.\""

The prosecution alleged that Lindy Chamberlain had cut Azaria\u2019s throat in the front seat of the family car and hidden the baby\u2019s body in a large camera case. Lawyers presented controversial forensic evidence, later discredited, to support their case. \n \n Azaria Chamberlain: archive coverage Read more \n \n Lindy served more than three years of a life sentence imposed in 1982 \u2013 giving birth to the couple\u2019s fourth child Kahlia in Darwin prison. Michael was handed an 18-month suspended sentence for being an accessory. \n \n In 1986, the chance discovery of Azaria\u2019s matinee jacket \u2013 an item of clothing her mother had always said her baby had been wearing at the time of the attack \u2013 reopened the case. After a royal commission in 1987 the Chamberlains were pardoned and their convictions quashed, but Michael remained bitter at their treatment. \n \n After divorcing, remarrying, earning a PhD in education, becoming a teacher and writing several books, he still lamented the case as a \u201cgross injustice\u201d. \n \n \u201cIt was one of the worst perversions of justice and forensic science in Australian history,\u201d he said in 2014. \u201cWe had gone as babes in the woods. A Catholic lawyer described us as lambs to the slaughter. \n \n \u201cWe had lived by the credo that if you have done nothing wrong, you have nothing to fear.

Michael married Ingrid Bergner in 1994, with whom he had daughter, Zahra, in 1996. \n \n Lindy Chamberlain also remarried, becoming Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton. \n \n The disappearance of Azaria prompted one of Australia\u2019s longest-running legal sagas, one that captivated and polarised the nation. It was the subject of the 1988 film Evil Angels, starring Meryl Streep as Lindy. The film was released as A Cry in the Dark in territories other than Australia and New Zealand. \n \n \n \n Despite the release of the Chamberlains from jail, a coronial inquest into Azaria in 1995 delivered an open verdict. The fourth coronial inquest into the case, held in 2012, ruled that a dingo was responsible for the baby\u2019s death. \n \n The was what the first inquest, back in early 1981, had also concluded, and what the Chamberlains had steadfastly said since Lindy yelled the famous words: \u201cThat dingo\u2019s got my baby.\u201d \n \n After the 2012 verdict Michael Chamberlain stood on the courtroom steps in Darwin and said: \u201cI am here to tell you that you can get justice even when you think that all is lost.\u201d \n \n Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton says abuse towards her has subsided Read more \n \n But he said he still had plenty of questions he wanted authorities to answer. \n \n \u201cI have peace and gratitude in my heart that Azaria\u2019s spirit now lies rested, and I have gratitude and peace in my heart because justice has been done for us,\u201d he said in 2012 on the release of his book Heart of Stone: Justice for Azaria. \n \n \u201cBut why did this happen to us? Why did it take so long? And why were there consistently a whole lot of mistakes made? \n \n \u201cIt was systemic; it just wasn\u2019t one or two. It wasn\u2019t isolated and I have to ask the question, was it by accident?\u201d \n \n Chamberlain made a tilt at state politics in 2003, running as a Liberal party candidate in the seat of Lake Macquarie in NSW. He didn\u2019tachieved a 5.2% swing against incumbent MP Geoff Hunter but was not elected. \n \n He then taught at an Aboriginal high school in Brewarrina, NSW, for three years before returning the central coast where he taught at Gosford high school until 2008, when he retired. \n \n The University of Newcastle last year appointed him a conjoint professor at its school of education. \n \n Chamberlain wrote three books, including Beyond Azaria: Black Light White Light, which detailed his feelings following the death of his daughter and the severe public scrutiny he and his family were placed under. \n \n He became Ingrid\u2019s full-time carer after she suffered a stroke in 2011. \n \n Chamberlain had three other children with Lindy \u2013 Reagan, Aidan and Kahlia \u2013 as well as Zahra. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Michael Chamberlain was wrongly convicted in the death of his baby daughter, Azaria, in 1980 \n \n Michael Chamberlain, who fought for years to clear his family's name after his baby daughter Azaria was killed by a dingo, has died at the age of 72. \n \n He died in Gosford hospital on Monday after complications from leukaemia. \n \n The case of Mr Chamberlain and his wife, Lindy, attracted huge attention in Australia. \n \n Prosecutors believed that the couple had killed their daughter. It was years before they were exonerated and the cause of death formally established. \n \n At a trial in 1982, Lindy was found guilty of murdering Azaria and sentenced to life in jail. Michael was convicted as an accessory after the fact - until a chance discovery in 1986 overturned both verdicts. \n \n Speaking in 2012, when the Northern Territory coroner finally ruled that Azaria had been taken by a dingo, Mr Chamberlain said that the battle to get to the legal truth had taken too long. \n \n \"However, I am here to tell you that you can get justice even when you think that all is lost,\" he said. \n \n Actor Sam Neill, who portrayed Michael in the film A Cry in the Dark, said: \"Throughout their cruel ordeal and the years of injustice, Michael Chamberlain maintained that quiet unassuming dignity - an impressive man. Rest in peace.\" \n \n What happened to Azaria Chamberlain? \n \n On 17 August 1980, the Chamberlain family were on a camping trip to Uluru, then called Ayer's Rock, when baby Azaria was taken from their tent by a dingo. \n \n Lindy reportedly cried out: \"my God, my God, the dingo's got my baby!\" but a frantic search by the camping group and local guides discovered nothing. Azaria's body was never found. \n \n Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Azaria Chamberlain was only nine weeks old when she disappeared \n \n In the aftermath, an inquest accepted Lindy and Michael's version of events, but law enforcement officials decided they did not. \n \n At the time, dingoes were not generally seen as dangerous, and the Chamberlains' story was not widely believed. \n \n A second inquest a year later led to allegations that the baby's throat had been cut and her body disposed of later. Chemical evidence of infant blood in the family car - which would later be widely discredited - was a key part of the prosecution. \n \n Lindy was charged with murder and sentenced to life in prison. \n \n Michael was charged with being an accessory after the fact and received an 18-month suspended sentence. \n \n How did Lindy and Michael prove their innocence? \n \n Lindy said her baby had been wearing a jacket, but there was no evidence of one among the baby's other clothes, found near the campsite. \n \n She was still in prison in early 1986, having exhausted her legal options all the way to a High Court appeal, when a chance discovery revealed new evidence to support her story. \n \n David Brett, an English backpacker, fell to his death while attempting to climb Uluru. The team searching for Mr Brett found a baby's jacket - matching exactly the brand and description Lindy gave in her testimony - in an area littered with dingo dens. \n \n Image copyright Reuters Image caption Michael, pictured with his former wife Lindy, were at the centre of Australia's famous \"dingo\" case \n \n The revelation prompted authorities to order a fresh investigation and to release Lindy from prison. \n \n It would be another two years before the pair were fully cleared, following a royal commission investigation. \n \n Why did the case capture the world's imagination? \n \n Lindy and Michael's story split the nation, and the court case was covered in sensational fashion by the media. \n \n Their religion, as Seventh Day Adventists, was not widely understood, leading to suspicion and even accusations of cult-like activity. It was one of the biggest legal and media events of the 1980s. \n \n After the miscarriage of justice emerged, the case became a prime example of media influence in court cases. \n \n Image copyright Twitter / @twopaddocks Image caption The injustice of the Chamberlain case brought the family many admirers \n \n Outside Australia, the story would find worldwide fame when turned into a film, A Cry in the Dark, starring Meryl Streep as Lindy and Sam Neill as Michael. \n \n A 32-year battle \n \n Despite Lindy's release, the official cause of death remained the subject of debate for decades. Many people in Australia still believed there was more to the case. \n \n Lindy and Michael divorced a few years after they were exonerated in the late 1980s, and Lindy began a campaign to have dingoes acknowledged as dangerous to humans. \n \n Media caption Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton: ''We are relieved and delighted'' \n \n In 2012, 32 years after Azaria's death, a coroner issued the final report in the case, formally stating that Azaria was attacked and taken by a dingo, as her parents had always maintained. \n \n Speaking after the verdict, Michael Chamberlain said \"the truth is out\" - and it was time for \"some healing and a chance to put our daughter's spirit to rest\". ||||| FILE - This October 1990, file photo shows Michael Chamberlain, right, and then his wife Lindy when Lindy launched her book on the disappearance of her baby daughter Azaria in 1980.

Chamberlain, who waged... (Associated Press) \n \n SYDNEY (AP) \u2014 Michael Chamberlain, who waged a decades-long battle to prove his baby daughter was killed by a dingo in Australia's most notorious case of injustice, has died, his former wife said Tuesday. He was 72. \n \n Chamberlain died suddenly, his ex-wife, Lindy Chamberlain, said in a statement. Michael Chamberlain's longtime friend and former lawyer, Stuart Tipple, told Australia's Fairfax Media that Michael died on Monday night as a result of complications from leukemia. \n \n \"I am on my way today to support and be with our children,\" Lindy said in a statement. \"Given Michael's death was unexpected, I would ask that the media please consider that Michael's wife and all of his children are deeply grieving and need some space.\" \n \n Lindy and Michael were wrongly convicted in the death of their 9-week-old daughter Azaria after the infant vanished from their tent during a 1980 camping trip to Uluru, the sacred monolith in Australia's Outback. \n \n The mystery surrounding Azaria's disappearance was the most divisive and sensational legal drama in Australian history. It gained a place in global pop culture after Meryl Streep portrayed Lindy in the movie \"A Cry in the Dark.\" \n \n The Chamberlains insisted that a dingo snatched their daughter from the tent. But officials doubted the wild dogs were capable of carrying an infant. Instead, prosecutors argued that Lindy had slit her daughter's throat and buried her in the desert. \n \n There were no witnesses, no motive and no body; Azaria's remains were never found. But in 1982, Lindy was nonetheless convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Michael was convicted of being an accessory after the fact and given a suspended sentence. \n \n Three years later, Azaria's jacket was found in the desert near a dingo den and Lindy was quickly released from prison. A Royal Commission, the highest form of investigation in Australia, later debunked much of the forensic evidence used at trial and the Chamberlains' convictions were overturned. In 2012 \u2014 more than three decades after Azaria vanished \u2014 a coroner finally ruled that the infant had died as a result of a dingo attack. \n \n The trial remains a source of shame for the many Australians who initially doubted the Chamberlains and cast Lindy as a villain largely due to her religious beliefs. Michael Chamberlain was a pastor with the Seventh-day Adventist church, a Protestant denomination that few Australians understood. Rumors flew that Lindy had killed her daughter as part of a grisly religious ritual. \n \n Shortly before the coroner's ruling in 2012, Michael Chamberlain told The Associated Press that religious bigotry played a large role in the injustice he and his former wife suffered. \n \n \"The church got so smashed up, erroneously, and all through, really, a nasty dose of prejudice,\" Chamberlain told The AP. \"I can say that I think our religion definitely impacted quite strongly on the attitude that many Australians developed.\" \n \n Michael and Lindy divorced in 1991. He later married Ingrid Bergner, and went on to become an author and teacher. \n \n Actor Sam Neill, who portrayed Michael in \"A Cry in the Dark,\" said on Monday that the Chamberlains had been \"terribly, cruelly wronged.\" \n \n \"Throughout their cruel ordeal & the years of injustice, (Michael) Chamberlain maintained that quiet unassuming dignity \u2014 an impressive man,\" Neill tweeted. \"RIP.\" \n \n Chamberlain, who was born in New Zealand, is survived by his wife and four children. ||||| We've detected that JavaScript is disabled in your browser.

    "reference": "\u2013 It's a phrase synonymous with \"the dog ate my homework.\" But for years, Michael Chamberlain tried to convince the world that it was true, that in the reported words of his former wife, \"the dingo took my baby.\" He died Monday at age 72 of complications from leukemia decades after finally establishing the truth. He and his then-wife Lindy had been camping with their 9-week-old daughter Azaria during a trip to Uluru in the Australian Outback in 1980 when the infant disappeared, per the AP. The couple claimed wild dogs took her, but authorities accused Lindy Chamberlain of slitting Azaria's throat and burying her body, which was never found, based on forensic evidence suggesting Azaria's blood was in the family's car, per the BBC. Lindy Chamberlain was sentenced to life in prison for murder in 1982, while Michael Chamberlain was found to be an accessory after the fact and given an 18-month suspended sentence. However, both convictions were overturned when Azaria's jacket was found near dingo dens in 1984; the forensic evidence was eventually discredited. \"You can get justice even when you think that all is lost,\" Michael Chamberlain, who split from his wife in 1991 and went on to write several books on the case, said in 2012 after a coroner ruled Azaria had been snatched by a dingo, reports the AAP. On Twitter, actor Sam Neill, who portrayed Chamberlain in the 1988 film A Cry in the Dark opposite Meryl Streep's Lindy, described him as \"an impressive man\" with a \"quiet unassuming dignity,\" who was \"terribly, cruelly wronged.\""

So are Alicia Keys, R. Kelly and gospel singer Donnie McClurkin, said A. Curtis Farrow of the Newark-based Irving Street Rep company, which is helping the Houston family organize the service. \n \n And Thursday night, the celebrity gossip website TMZ reported that the Houston family has reached out to Bobby Brown, Whitney\u2019s ex-husband, and have formally invited him to attend the service. \n \n Interviews with church leaders, friends of the family and others suggest the funeral will be a mixture of a Parade of Stars and religious music revelry. \n \n \"It\u2019s going to be a ceremony that reflects her life,\" New Hope church Pastor Joe A. Carter said yesterday as sound equipment was loaded through church doors. \n \n Farrow, who has known members of the Houston family for about 16 years, characterized the service as \"a celebration of Whitney\u2019s life, with the participation of many people who are very important in Whitney\u2019s life.\" \n \n Houston\u2019s cousin, Dionne Warwick, is scheduled to speak at the service, as are filmmaker Tyler Perry, Houston\u2019s music-industry mentor Clive Davis and Houston\u2019s sister-in-law and manager, Patricia Houston, Farrow said. \n \n The church\u2019s New Hope Mass Choir, along with the New Jersey Mass Choir, will perform the processional and the opening, Farrow said.

Since she didn\u2019t know if she would be able to get close tomorrow, she stood outside the church yesterday afternoon in the drizzle. \n \n \"This is just a way to say thank you,\" Johnson said as she scanned the mini shrine fans made for the star on the church\u2019s front fence. \"I understand they want their privacy, and they need that for now.\" \n \n Tyrone Hudson of Newark and his partner, Bobby Hudson, tied a balloon on the fence that read: \"You\u2019re always in our hearts.\" \n \n \"I loved her music, I loved her,\" said Hudson, who at 48 was the same age as the pop queen. \n \n \n \n Others, like 35-year-old Fuquan Snead of Newark, don\u2019t have a Houston story, but can rattle off a list of hits from the artist who had 11 songs that topped the charts. \n \n And barricades or not, rain or not, they say they\u2019ll come out to pay their respects to a fellow Newarker. \n \n \"You loved this woman\u2019s music for many years, you have to come out and show your support,\" Snead said. \n \n FLAGS AT HALF-STAFF \n \n Mayor Cory Booker will attend the services, according to his spokeswoman, Anne Torres. As of Thursday, he was the only Newark dignitary to publicly receive an invitation. \n \n The mayor also said Newark will lower flags at its municipal buildings to half-staff in honor of Houston, mirroring Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s controversial decision to do the same at state facilities. \n \n \"Our city is mourning the loss of one of its native daughters and one of music\u2019s shining stars,\" Booker said in a statement. \"Whitney Houston inspired so many people, and although she went from a Newark church to the global stage, she always remained a deep part of our city\u2019s pride and collective heart.\" \n \n Outside the funeral home yesterday, a simple condolence book sat atop a Plexiglas stand. \n \n Through the funeral parlor\u2019s glass doors facing Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, passers-by could glimpse a large picture of Houston. The portrait of the singer is framed by a black microphone stand in one corner and a high-backed \"Diva\" chair with a fur throw in the other. A Bible atop the fur is open to the 23rd Psalm. \n \n By yesterday morning, dozens had signed the book, and a few jotted down lengthier tributes to the singing sensation who died Saturday in her room at the Beverly Hills Hilton. \n \n \"You are one of God\u2019s angels and he has called you home,\" read one. \n \n With no public services for Houston, funeral home director Carolyn Whigham wanted to give admirers a chance to note their condolences. \n \n \"It\u2019s put together as memorabilia,\" she said. \n \n Whigham, who has known the Houston family for decades, said the condolence book would be given to Bobbi Christina Brown, Houston\u2019s 18-year-old daughter. \n \n Newark\u2019s Sherri Dillard, 32, stopped by on the cold, overcast morning. \n \n \"I had to be here \u2014 she\u2019s like family,\" she said, brushing aside a tear. \"I love her dead or alive.\" \n \n A Middlesex County police officer, Dillard said she would do all she could to attend tomorrow\u2019s services. \n \n Maplewood\u2019s Alex Boykins, 38, also signed the book. \n \n \"I was brought up on her music,\" he said after taking a picture of the window display. \n \n Boykins said that although a more formal public commemoration would be fitting, he understood the family\u2019s decision. \n \n \"We\u2019ve had her for many years,\" he said. \"We have to appreciate and respect that.\" \n \n By Jay Lustig and James Queally/ The Star-Ledger \n \n Star-Ledger staff writers Alexi Friedman, Victoria St. Martin, Richard Khavkine, Mark Di Ionno and Mike Frassinelli contributed to this report. ||||| Kevin Costner, who hand-picked Whitney Houston for \u2018The Bodyguard\u2019, will pay special tribute at her final curtain Bobby Brown to attend Saturday\u2019s funeral despite friction with Cissy Houston \n \n He catapulted her to Hollywood superstardom as her big-screen bodyguard and now Kevin Costner will pay special tribute to Whitney Houston at her final curtain. \n \n The co-star behind Houston\u2019s romantic thriller \u201cThe Bodyguard\u201d will address a church on Saturday packed with A-listers, including Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Alicia Keys and Tyler Perry, a source said. \n \n The two-time Oscar winner hand-picked Houston to play his tempestuous diva and reportedly told her not to take acting lessons to preserve the natural charm he found so alluring. \n \n WHITNEY HOUSTON: HER LIFE IN PHOTOS \n \n \u201cSome of my choices are real simple, and it\u2019s very easy to fall in love with Whitney,\u201d he told the Los Angeles Times in 1992 \u2014 the year the movie and its smash single, \u201cI Will Always Love You,\u201d dominated pop culture. \n \n Wonder and Franklin are scheduled to sing at the invitation-only service inside the New Hope Baptist Church in Newark. \n \n Houston\u2019s music mentor Clive Davis also will speak, her rep said.
