    "- The study focused on trichotillomania (TTM), a chronic impulse control disorder characterized by repetitive hair pulling, and utilized trichoscopy as a diagnostic tool to identify specific patterns associated with TTM in 10 patients at a tertiary hospital in Bagalkot, South India, between January and July 2014.\n- The mean age of participants was 34 years, with a range from 13 to 55 years, and the mean duration of the disorder was 19 months (ranging from 2 to 36 months). All patients exhibited patchy hair loss on the scalp, particularly in the frontal area.\n- Trichoscopic examination revealed common findings such as decreased hair density and hairs broken at varying lengths in all patients, with additional patterns like coiled hairs, upright re-growing hairs, and novel diagnostic signs such as black dots and flame hairs observed in a subset of patients.\n- Histopathological analysis confirmed noninflammatory alopecia, with findings including distorted and collapsed inner root sheaths, and the absence of significant inflammation, which aids in differentiating TTM from other hair loss conditions like alopecia areata.",
    "- The study investigates trichotillomania (TTM), a chronic impulse control disorder characterized by repetitive hair pulling, primarily affecting the scalp, with specific emphasis on identifying trichoscopic patterns unique to TTM that can aid in early diagnosis. The research was conducted on 10 patients at a tertiary dermatology department in South India, documenting demographic and clinical data, including age, gender, site of lesions, and disease duration.\n\n- Utilizing a DermLite 3 dermoscope, the researchers observed various trichoscopic features, such as decreased hair density, broken hairs of varying lengths, coiled hairs, and other novel patterns like \"black dots,\" \"flame hairs,\" and the \"V-sign.\" These features were identified in all patients and are considered specific to TTM, contrasting with other forms of alopecia like alopecia areata.\n\n- The mean age of patients was 34 years, with a mean disease duration of 19 months. All patients exhibited patchy hair loss predominantly in the frontal scalp area, and some reported pulling or eating their hair, with one patient displaying signs of trichophagia. Histopathological examination confirmed noninflammatory alopecia with distorted hair follicles.\n\n- The study highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by TTM due to overlapping clinical features with other hair loss conditions, particularly alopecia areata.
