    "– A 71-year-old lawyer is suing United Airlines for more than $1 million after an employee knocked him down during an argument two years ago, the Southeast Texas Record reports. According to the Washington Post, the July 21, 2015, incident started when the TSA at Houston's Bush Intercontinental Airport wouldn't let Ronald Tigner through due to an illegible boarding pass. According to the lawsuit Tigner filed June 7, he returned to the ticketing area. He says two United employees—Alejandro Anastasia and Ianthe Phillips-Allred—refused to help him there, instead laughing and cursing at him. Tigner's attorney, William Hoke, tells KPRC that when Tigner told Anastasia to \"wipe that smile off his face,\" Anastasia threatened violence. Hoke says surveillance video of what happened next is \"one of the most inhumane things I've ever seen.\" Video shows Anastasia shove Tigner to the ground, where he lies motionless and splayed out for minutes. Hoke says Tigner hit his head on the ground and was knocked unconscious and that United employees stood around looking at Tigner until a passerby finally stopped to help him. \"They literally left him there like a piece of garbage,\" Hoke says. Tigner is suing United, Anastasia, and Phillips-Allred for negligence. The lawsuit claims he was left with \"physical disfigurement\" and \"mental anguish.\" United says Anastasia's behavior was \"unacceptable\" and \"does not reflect our values.\" Anastasia was charged with felony injury to an elderly individual and punished with a fine and anger-management classes. He no longer works for United. (United's new flight is a doozy.)",
