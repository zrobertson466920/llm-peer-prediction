  "reference": "many studies over the past 15 years have focused on discovering solvents that help promote efficient cc bond formation under benign reaction conditions . \n new solvents in dielsalder(2 ) and barbier reactions have been sought to help streamline the one - pot transformations further , reducing synthetic steps and organic waste . \n polar media often accelerate reactions of this type which has led to the use of water as an acceptable solvent for such organic conversions . \n recent contributions from our laboratory to this field have centered on coupling reactions between propargyl aldehydes and allyl or propargyl halides under barbier conditions to form homoallylic and homopropargylic propargyl alcohols . \n these compounds find wide use as synthetic templates and show a propensity for oxy - cope rearrangements ( scheme 1 ) . \n the use of -chloropropargylphenyl sulfide ( 4 ) , coupled with a propargyl aldehyde should offer an easy route into formation of enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures ( scheme 2 ) . \n previous studies revealed that formation of 2 or 3 under indium - promoted barbier conditions is solvent dependent . \n use of an organic solvent for the coupling reaction results in a mixture of 2 and 3 while the use of water as a solvent yields 2 as the sole product . \n it is possible that water protonates the coupled product to form 2 quickly , quenching the alkoxide intermediate , thereby suppressing the possible oxy - cope pathway shown in scheme 1 . \n it may also be possible that the increased polarity of the solvent itself stabilizes the anion formed upon coupling , thus raising the relative rate of cope rearrangement in this system . with a less polar , aprotic solvent , \n the anion will not be quenched , nor will it be stabilized to the same extent as witnessed in water . \n a combination of these phenomena may be why an oxy - cope rearrangement occurs under less polar conditions , forming product 3 ( scheme 1 ) . \n a coupling reaction between 1 and 4 ( scheme 2 ) was conducted under aqueous conditions to form 2 ( y = sph ) , with good regioselectivity ; however , the rate of this reaction is surprisingly slow . \n although reactions of the type shown in scheme 1 are reported in the literature to be accelerated by polar solvents such as water , coupling reactions between 1 and 4 , as shown in scheme 2 , are quite slow . indeed , \n when water is used as the solvent , reactions often require 1036 h for completion . \n this oil has a density greater than that of water so it is presumed to be an organometallic species formed by interaction of the indium metal with the halide species . \n isolation of the oil followed by workup in an acidic thf / h2o mixture leads to isolation of propargylphenyl sulfide and , to a smaller extent , the aldehyde . \n we surmise that low solubility of this organometallic complex leads to poor reagent mixing , slowing the barbier coupling under aqueous conditions . \n second , indium - promoted coupling reactions conducted in water become more acidic as the reaction proceeds . \n we believe it is possible that the aldehyde is in equilibrium with its corresponding hydrate species , reducing the electrophilicity of the carbon center . \n a combination of these two reasons would lead to a decrease in the rate of reaction between 1 and 4 when conducted in an aqueous solvent . \n the reaction proceeds more quickly ( 812 h ) in dmf , a less polar solvent , due to better solubility of all reagents , however , a mixture of 2 and 3 was isolated . \n it was originally expected that a mixture of water and dmf would lead to faster reaction times while still maintaining regiocontrol of product formation . the use of a water / dmf solvent system , however , resulted in a mixture of products with water constituting up to 50% v / v of the solvent system . \n when water exceeds 50% v / v of the solvent system , only product 2 is isolated , but the rate of reaction slows perceptively once again . to help expedite this reaction sequence , \n we began a search for solvent with polarity similar to , or greater than that of water . \n it was expected that an extremely polar organic solvent would promote the same type of acceleration normally witnessed in barbier couplings carried out under aqueous conditions . \n an organic solvent could also help solubilize the intermediate and reduce possible formation of the hydrate species , thus allowing for a faster coupling reaction to occur . \n if increased polarity stabilizes the anion formed by coupling of 1 and 4 , oxy - cope rearrangement should also be suppressed . with a dielectric constant of 186.9 at 25 c , significantly greater than that of water ( 78.37(7 ) ) , and dmf ( 38.3(7b ) ) , \n n - methylformamide ( nmf ) has found occasional use in previous reactions requiring polar organic solvents ; however , it has historically found more widespread use as an organic reagent . with a pka of approximately 24,(7d ) \n nmf is reactive under a range of organometallic reagent conditions , limiting its use as a solvent . \n indium - promoted coupling reactions , however , have been shown to be accelerated under aqueous conditions,(1 ) and the relative acidity of nmf , being higher than that of water , should not hinder the proposed barbier couplings proposed within this paper . \n we were especially intrigued by the fact that the dielectric constant of nmf increases to 220 as the temperature is lowered from 25 to 0 c . \n we were interested in examining what effect the increase in dielectric constant at lower temperature could have on a barbier - style reaction of the type shown in scheme 2 among others . \n this paper reports on the use of nmf in barbier - style reactions with a focus on rates of reaction , stereochemistry , and its use to form enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures.(9 ) \n although nmf has characteristics similar to those of dmf , it also has characteristics similar to water , such as a polar xh bond.(7 ) thus , having found a very polar solvent with properties similar to both water and organic systems , we hypothesized that the 1,2-coupling product could be formed in high yield under short reaction times . \n a series of reactions was set up to test this hypothesis . as shown in table 1 , use of either water or \n nmf resulted in formation of the 1,2-product ( 2 ) solely with no trace of 3 detected in the product mixture . \n although the yield of product was moderate to high in either solvent , product formation in reactions conducted in nmf proceeded at a much greater rate . \n we believe that there are two possible reasons behind the rate increase of coupling reactions carried out in nmf . \n the ratio of reagent was as follows : 1.0:1.5:1.1 ( aldehyde / halide / indium ) . \n the reaction was run at 0.1 m with respect to indium . in the lewis acid catalyzed reaction , 10 molar % of the lewis acid was used . \n all species completely dissolved in nmf , unlike what was observed for reactions in water . as such , we believe mixing is much more efficient , allowing the reaction to proceed at a faster rate . \n has also been noted in many literature examples to lead to rate enhancement in indium - promoted barbier reactions . \n we believe a mixture of better solubility coupled with greater solvent polarity results in an additive effect toward increasing the rate of reactions conducted in nmf when compared to water . \n h - bonding capabilities of nmf may explain the greater regioselectivity for reactions conducted in nmf when compared to those observed in dmf and thf ; however , the h - bonding capacity of nmf is much lower than that of water.(7d ) increased solvent polarity , thus increasing the stability of the intermediate anion and raising the relative energy of the oxy - cope rearrangement , may seem more likely at this time . in an effort to exclude the solvent as a direct participant in intermediate formation when nmf is used , nmr spectroscopy studies were performed to determine if a possible hemiaminal or imminium species was forming in situ ( figure 1 ) . \n the imminium functionality carries a positive charge and would increase the electrophilicity of the reactive carbon . \n mixing of 1 and nmf under sonication for periods of up to 24 h , however , revealed the presence of only 1 and nmf by nmr spectroscopy . possible formation of hemiaminal or imminium species . the presence or absence of a lewis acid has shown to help control stereoselectivity in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions . \n previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the addition of indium(iii ) chloride as a lewis acid favors formation of the syn - product in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions between 4 and aldehyde functional groups . in the absence of the lewis acid , \n the anti - product is favored ( figure 2).(5b ) it was our hope that similar effects would be witnessed in the present system , especially while using nmf as the reaction solvent , and we were pleased to s...",
