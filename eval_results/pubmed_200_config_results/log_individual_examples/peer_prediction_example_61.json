it was proven useful to identify nonsystemic inflammatory response syndrome and was firstly used in sepsis . \n nt - pro - bnp is a biologically inactive form that is cleaved from the prohormone probrain natriuretic peptide ( pro - bnp ) by proteolytic enzymes before secretion . \n crp is a widely used biomarker to discriminate the inflammatory response to sepsis . il-6 and il-10 are important proinflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokines during sepsis course . \n .   indicated that strem-1 was more accurate than pct and crp in the diagnosis of sepsis , but others showed that the prognostic utility of serum strem-1 in septic shock was inferior to that of pct . \n the purpose of the study was to compare the prognostic value of biomarkers and cytokines versus clinical severity scores and improved death risk prediction . \n a total of 102 patients with sepsis from single centre hospital intensive care unit were enrolled from december 2010 to august 2012 according to the 2001 international sepsis definition conference . \n exclusion criteria included : age younger than 18 years , preexisting thyroid disease and lung cancer that influence procalcitonin levels , patients with acute coronary syndromes and renal dysfunction , and patients staying in icu less than 24 hours . \n the study was approved by the hospital 's ethics committee and either the patients or their relatives provided informed consent . \n demographic and disease data of patients included age , gender , chief complaints for admission , vital signs , length of stay in icu , infection sites , microorganisms , routine blood test results , liver and kidney functions , coagulation indicators , blood gas analysis , acute physiologic assessment and chronic health evaluation ( apache ) ii scores , and sequential organ failure assessment ( sofa ) scores . \n these were recorded on 3 days ( days 1 , 3 , and 5 ) . \n serum was collected at these same time points and pct , strem-1 , nt - pro - bnp , crp , il-6 , and il-10 levels were determined in the end . \n pct was measured using an enzyme - linked fluorescence analysis kit ( elfa , vidas brahms pct kit , biomerieux sa , france ) . \n strem-1 was determined using a double antibody sandwich elisa ( quantikine human trem-1 immunoassay elisa kit , r & d systems , minneapolis , mn , usa ) . \n nt - pro - bnp was measured with an available immunoassay analyzer ( elecsys 2010 ;

strem-1 even had a increase trend ( p < 0.05 ) . \n serum crp levels in both surviving and nonsurviving groups had decrease tendency ( p < 0.05 ) ( figure 2 ) . \n recently , pct , strem-1 , crp , and nt - pro - bnp cytokines were widely used to diagnose sepsis and reflect the severity , but the results were not the same . \n meanwhile , there were few studies to put so many biomarkers in one study , particularly how to combine the biomarkers , and clinical severity scores remained unclear . \n the present study showed that the serum levels of strem-1 and pct in nonsurvival group were higher than those in the survival group ; meanwhile , they decreased in survival group , but stayed in high levels even increased in the nonsurvival group during sepsis time course . \n many previous studies have shown that dynamic changes in strem-1 levels could predict survival and mortality of patients at the early stage of sepsis [ 10 , 11 ] . \n strem-1 is widely used to diagnose sepsis [ 7 , 12 ] . in the present study , \n serum strem-1 levels of patients in the nonsurvival group were significantly higher than those in the survival group on day 1 ;

    "- In the shadowy realm of the ICU, where sepsis reigns as the silent specter of mortality, researchers seek the glimmering beacons of biomarkers—soluble TREM-1, procalcitonin, and cytokines—each a whisper of hope, guiding doctors toward early diagnosis and the potential salvation of lives.\n\n- With a symphony of data collected from 102 brave souls, the study dances through the intricacies of illness, unveiling that while TREM-1 and procalcitonin rise like the tide in the faces of those who falter, they also ebb away in the survivors, painting a stark contrast in their fates.\n\n- As the clock ticks through the critical days of sepsis, the study’s melody reveals that certain markers, like TREM-1 and procalcitonin, hold the key to predicting mortality, their levels singing a tale of despair for the nonsurvivors while offering a softer serenade for those who endure.\n\n- In the end, the researchers wield their findings like a compass, navigating the turbulent waters of sepsis management and revealing the potential of combining biomarkers with clinical scores—a harmonious approach that may illuminate the path to better outcomes in this deadly battle.",
    "- **Mortality Metrics**: Sepsis remains a predominant etiology of mortality in the intensive care setting, with septic shock mortality rates approaching 60%, necessitating the exploration of prognostic biomarkers and clinical severity indices for enhanced risk stratification.\n\n- **Biomolecular Profiling**: The study investigates various biomarkers, including soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1), procalcitonin (PCT), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-10 (IL-10), and their diagnostic precision and prognostic capabilities in sepsis.\n\n- **Study Design and Methodology**: A cohort of 102 septic patients was evaluated, utilizing univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses alongside receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assessments to analyze the relationship between biomarker levels, clinical severity scores (APACHE II, SOFA), and 28-day mortality outcomes.\n\n- **Findings on Biomarker Dynamics**: Elevated serum levels of sTREM-1, PCT, and IL-6 were significantly associated with non-survivors, with a noted trend of decreasing levels in survivors versus persistent or increasing levels in non-survivors, underscoring the potential utility of these biomarkers for real-time monitoring and prognostication in septic patients.",
    "- Sepsis remains a significant challenge in critical care settings, with a notable portion of affected individuals facing considerable hurdles in recovery, despite advancements in treatment options.\n- Various biomarkers and cytokines, including strem-1 and procalcitonin, have been explored for their potential in enhancing early diagnosis and outcome predictions for sepsis patients.\n- The study aimed to compare the effectiveness of these biomarkers and clinical assessment scores in providing insights into patient prognosis, revealing nuanced differences in their predictive capabilities.\n- Findings suggest that while some biomarkers show promise, their utility can vary, highlighting the complexity of managing sepsis and the need for ongoing research in this area.",
    "- Sepsis remains a leading cause of ICU death; mortality from septic shock is ~60%.\n- Study compares prognostic value of biomarkers (sTREM-1, PCT, IL-6) vs. clinical scores (APACHE II, SOFA) in 102 sepsis patients.\n- Higher sTREM-1, PCT, IL-6 levels in nonsurvivors; these levels decreased in survivors.\n- sTREM-1 and PCT were significant predictors of 28-day mortality; accuracy of clinical scores exceeded that of biomarkers."
