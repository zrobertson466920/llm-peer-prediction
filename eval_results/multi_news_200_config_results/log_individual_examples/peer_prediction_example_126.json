    "– An accused rapist in Canada is defending himself with the argument that he is physically incapable of the crime. Specifically, says the lawyer for Jacques Rouschop, \"his stomach is too large and his penis is way, way too small,\" reports the Ottawa Citizen. The 44-year-old is accused of raping and choking two sex workers in 2013 in his pickup truck. But his first defense witness was a registered nurse who took the suspect's measurements in jail and testified that Rouschop's penis was about 2 inches when erect. The 5-foot-6 Rouschop also weighed about 400 pounds at the time of the alleged attacks and has an umbilical hernia about the size of a baseball, reports the National Post. To buttress his case, jurors were shown photographs of his naked body. “Due to his weight and his appearance, he will be the first to tell you that he has had a lot of trouble attracting members of the opposite sex, and that getting a woman’s attention, let alone having sex, was not something that happened very often for him,\" says his lawyer. She acknowledges that Rouschop, a career thief, did indeed visit sex workers, but she maintains that he could not have raped a woman from behind, as one of the sex workers testified. The allegations stem from a police investigation into the 2013 murder of another sex worker, and while police have publicly linked Rouschop to that crime, they have not charged him, reports the Ottawa Sun. “He believes he is the subject of a witch hunt,” says his attorney.
