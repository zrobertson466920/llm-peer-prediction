  "reference": "neurosurgery is characterized by the delicate balance between surgical success and potential for devastating side effects . thanks to multiple technological improvements \n , the morbidity of neurosurgical interventions has substantially decreased over the last decades , allowing for the resection of previously inoperable lesions . in particular , image - guided neurosurgery ( igns ) devices allow the use of coregistered and fused multimodality 3d images to guide the surgeon 's hand and help define preoperatively the boundaries of pathological and predefined functional structures . meanwhile \n , new modes of medical imaging have also improved the localization of pathological lesions and their characterization . \n medical imaging nowadays includes a wealth of different techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( smri and fmri ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , and positron emission tomography ( pet ) . \n although the overall accuracy of igns is estimated to be 12  mm , current neuronavigation systems can not , however , adapt to changing conditions over time . \n skull - opening brain shift , brain retraction , cerebrospinal fluid suction , lesion resection , perfusion , and pharmacological manipulation during surgery indeed all alter the 3d morphology of the structures [ 25 ] . \n these changes can lead to localization errors that are one order of magnitude larger that igns accuracy [ 1 , 2 , 6 ] and may result in incomplete resections or unexpected damage to normal brain . \n such inaccuracies could be reduced if one could acquire , throughout surgery , fresh images of the same modalities and quality as the preoperative ones \n intraoperative images such as intraoperative mr ( imr ) images are  with the exception of a handful surgical facilities  usually acquired using low - field mri scanners that provide lower resolution and contrast than their preoperative counterparts , and , to this date , several useful imaging modalities , such as pet and possibly meg , can not be acquired intraoperatively . \n one solution is to  bring over  the high - quality preoperative multimodality images into the intraoperative configuration of the brain using a nonrigid registration technique [ 710 ] . \n one category of nonrigid registration techniques uses physics - based models , where landmarks are tracked in successive reduced - quality intraoperative images , and their displacement fields drive the deformation of a biomechanical model . \n so far , most of the mechanical conditions of the brain can not be estimated in the operating room , such as the volume of cerebrospinal fluid flowing out of the skull cavity , intercellular fluid volume changes that result from mannitol injection , or changes in blood volume and vessel permeability . \n the fact that an intraoperative image can provide the knowledge of the current state of the brain after some deformation partly eliminates the need for a complete evaluation of these mechanical conditions . \n the nonrigid registration technique replaces them with the landmark displacements evaluated from successive intraoperative images . using a nonrigid registration technique based on a biomechanical model , three types of brain deformations \n have been identified that require specific modeling , although they depend on common parameters , such as csf suction , perfusion , or pharmacological manipulation . \n the first deformation is the brain shift , which appears at the beginning of surgery with the opening of the skull and dura . \n the suction or leakage of csf , as well as the release of intracranial pressure caused by tumor growth , generally cause such shift of the brain ( note that in this work , we name  brain shift  the specific shift of the brain that occurs after the opening of the skull and dura , before any other surgical act has happened ) . \n however , for these deformations , we will consider that the shift is a part of these two deformations . \n the second deformation is the retraction ; when target tissues are located deep inside the brain , the surgeon incises brain tissues and inserts a retractor to spread out the tissues , and to create a path towards the target . \n the third deformation is the resection , that is , the removal , of lesion tissues . \n three deformations can thus be defined in terms of the two elemental actions that change the topology of the brain : the introduction of a discontinuity and the removal of some tissues . \n most studies of brain deformation based on biomechanical models have focused on shifts ( the topology of the brain is not modified ) , that occurs just after the opening of the skull and dura [ 1125 ] . \n a good review of these different studies can be found in [ 24 , 2628 ] . \n resection and retraction are more complex to model than ( brain ) shift . until recently , \n their modeling for the specific application of preoperative image update has received much less attention . \n one of the difficulty for modeling resection and retraction is that both induce a topological change of the brain because some tissue are cut . \n a method of mesh adaptation [ 2931 ] or remeshing [ 3235 ] must be used in conjunction with fem if an accurate representation of the location of the cut , for example , the resection cavity or retraction path , is needed to deform the model . indeed , fem can not directly handle discontinuities that go through the fes , and requires to realign the discontinuity with fe boundaries . in the field of fracture mechanics , which studies the growth and propagation of cracks in mechanical parts \n , some methods were developed to avoid using fem in conjunction with mesh adaptation or remeshing . \n the extended finite element method ( xfem or x - fem ) appeared in 1999   and has been the object of considerable research since then . \n xfem works by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within some fes of the mesh . \n the mesh does not have to conform to the discontinuities , so that these can be arbitrarily located with respect to the underlying fe mesh . because xfem allows an accurate representation of the discontinuities \n while avoiding mesh adaption or remeshing , and because of the similarity between cracks in mechanical parts and cuts in tissue , we proposed the use of xfem for handling cut , resection , and retraction in the updating of preoperative images . \n this paper presents a complete 3d framework for updating multimodal preoperative images with respect to surgical brain deformations , due to brain shift and successive resections , followed and quantified using imr images . \n our approach is modular , and is applied iteratively each time a new intraoperative image is acquired . \n we take into account successive deformations based on a linear elastic biomechanical model which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the pair of imr images under consideration , namely , brain shift or resection . \n while some 3d results have already been presented for brain shift , and initial 3d results for resection   modelings , this paper is the first complete and detailed account of the generalization to 3d of our 2d previous work . \n we present the state - of - the - art of resection modeling for preoperative image update . in section 3 \n , we describe our basic strategy for updating preoperative images based on successive intraoperative images . in section 4 , we give detail about our methods and algorithms . in section 5 , \n we consider two patient cases that illustrate our approach for handling brain shift followed by successive resections . \n among studies that take into account resection for preoperative image update , one should distinguish two categories . \n the first category of studies models brain deformation using two time - point images , the first image being acquired before surgery has started , the second image being acquired after resection . in this category , \n the methods that existed for a second image showing some brain shift are adapted for a second image showing some resection . \n the second category of studies models brain deformation using more than two time - point images , and models at least two successive resections . among the first category of studies , \n hagemann et al .   developed a 2d method for modeling brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and a postoperative mr image , the postoperative image showing a complete resection . \n the 2d mesh of the biomechanical model corresponded to the underlying pixel grid of the 2d image . \n the biomechanical model included four different linear elastic laws for the skull / skin region , the whole - brain region , the csf region , and the image background . \n they computed the correspondence of the skull boundary , the whole - brain region boundary in the neighborhood of the tumor , and the posterior midline between the two images . \n they also com...",
