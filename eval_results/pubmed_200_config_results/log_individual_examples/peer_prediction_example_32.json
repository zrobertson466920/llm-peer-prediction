cutoff 50 \n patients with an aldosterone - rennin ratio ( arr ) > 20 underwent any 1 of 3 confirmatory tests ( saline infusion , captopril challenge , or postural stimulation ) to confirm or exclude definitively primary hyperaldosteronism ( pa ) . \n categorical data such as gender and clinical / radiologic features were compared using -test or fisher 's exact test . \n variables that resulted in a p < 0.05 in the univariate analyses were entered into logistic regression analysis to assess the risk factors of functional lesions . \n the hospital ethics committee approved this study , and written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their parents . \n of 578 patients with adrenal enlargement , 78 cases ( 13.49% ) were detected incidentally . \n every 2 years , the numbers of total cases were 17 , 11 , 14 , 24 , 33 , 31 , 54 , 55 , 114 , and 225 , respectively . \n the numbers of incidental adrenal enlargement cases were 0 , 0 , 0 , 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 4 , 16 , and 49 , respectively . \n in addition , the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement gradually increased ( 0 , 0 , 0 , 4.17% , 3.03% , 7.32% , 9.26% , 7.27% , 14.04% , and 21.33% ) . \n 39 cases had unilateral enlargement on the left side and 3 on the right side , and the remaining 36 were bilateral enlargement . \n as shown in table 1 , routine medical checkup was found to have the greatest chance ( 43.59% ) of revealing clinical onsets leading to the discovery of adrenal enlargement . \n predominant complaints included low back pain ( 10.26% ) and abdominal pain ( 3.85% ) . in addition , there were 30 ( 38.46% ) cases in which the lesions were incidentally detected during hospitalization for underlying diseases , such as diabetes mellitus , hypertension , and coronary heart disease , among others . biochemical and functional evaluation revealed that 54 ( 69.23% ) cases were nonfunctional and 12 ( 15.38% ) were subclinical cushing syndrome ( scs ) ; among these patients , 10 cases were diagnosed as aimah , the other 2 were diagnosed as adenomas , and they were all confirmed by pathology results . \n primary hyperaldosteronism 6 ( 7.69% ) , metastatic 1 ( 1.28% ) , the primary cancer was gastric cancer . \n there were 5 patients ( 6.41% ) whose functional status remained unclear because of failure to finish the functional evaluation ( figure 2 ) . \n nodular adrenal enlargement ( or 7.306 ; 95% ci , 1.72728.667 ; p = 0.006 ) was the risk factor for functional lesions . \n as outlined above , incidental adrenal enlargement is detected with increasing frequency , most likely due to widespread increase in cross - sectional imaging , and is gradually emerging as a common clinical problem . \n our study shows that the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement has gradually increased by year . \n mean age at diagnosis was 50.32 years , which is in line with other incidentally detected adrenal findings , namely , adrenal incidentaloma . \n the increasing age of the general population and a research trend towards more advanced investigations in the elderly population may be contributing to the high detection rate in this age group . \n our results indicate that , for the elderly patients , it is essential to place emphasis on these incidental findings . \n 's study   indicated that , of the total 64 patients , of which 40 ( 63% ) were men and 24 ( 37% ) were women , 43 ( 67% ) cases were bilateral enlargement and 21 ( 33% ) cases were unilateral . \n in addition , smooth enlargement was more common , in 53 ( 83% ) cases , and together these statistics reflect the likelihood that adrenal enlargement will be bilateral , smooth , and found in men . \n however , our study did not show this tendency , likely because the research goals and thus , study populations , differed between the 2 studies . \n 's study aimed to explore prevalence , while the present study aimed to evaluate functional status . \n in addition , patients enrolled in our study were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology . it should be noted that admitting was more or less selective , especially in tertiary referral hospitals , and that economic considerations in parts of china were still a problem . \n clinically , upon discovery of incidental adrenal enlargement , 2 issues arise : functionality and malignancy . in the relevant literature [ 48 ] , adrenal enlargement can result from endocrine disorders , such as adrenocorticotropic hormone- ( acth- ) dependent or independent cushing syndrome , pa , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men-1 ) , and congenital adrenal hyperplasia . \n other potential causes include nonfunctional lesions , defined as a radiographic adrenal enlargement without clinical or biochemical manifestations , inflammation , neoplastic processes , obesity , or depression . \n 12 patients were found to have subclinical cushing syndrome ( originated from the adrenal gland ) and 6 patients were diagnosed with pa . however , the variety of disease spectrum in the study was only moderate , perhaps due , in part , to the limited number of included cases . \n it is important to note that even though reported prevalence was up to 11.3% , patient referrals to endocrinologists are relatively rare . \n this is likely related to the poor radiological awareness of this issue and its potential clinical significance . \n the clinical significance of lesion location and patient gender is smaller . in the present study , \n acth - independent macronodular hyperplasia ( aimah ) and primary pigmented nodular adrenal hyper...",
