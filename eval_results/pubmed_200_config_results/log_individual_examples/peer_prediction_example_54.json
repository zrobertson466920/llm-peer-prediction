those for autoimmune antibodies included anti - nuclear , anti - double stranded dna , and anti - neutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies ; and those for tumor markers included -fetoprotein , carbohydrate antigen 19 - 9 , and carcinoembryonic antigen . \n the serological test for toxocara antibodies ( igg ) was positive , whereas those for echinococcus , paragonimus westermani , sparganumi , and trichinella antibodies were negative . \n the chest and abdomen radiographic examinations were normal . to investigate the cause of the epigastric pain and tenderness , \n abdominal computed tomography was performed , which revealed severe edematous wall thickening with focal localized low attenuation of the fundus and cardia of the stomach ( fig . \n she underwent a repeated egd , which showed diffuse necrotic change in the fundus , cardia , and upper body ( fig . \n a biopsy specimen was obtained during egd ; a rapid urease test ( clotest ) revealed no evidence of helicobacter pylori . on histopathologic evaluation , \n the gastric surface was found to be eroded and the underlying lamina propria showed dense eosinophilic infiltration . \n she was treated with empirical intravenous antibiotics ( cefoperazone and metronidazole ) immediately after her transfer because infectious gastritis was not ruled out . \n although she was treated with a broad - spectrum anthelmintic ( albendazole ) , antibiotics , proton pump inhibitor , and prokinetic agent during the next 5 days , her symptoms became worse . \n eosinophilic gastritis was diagnosed according to the clinical pictures , laboratory findings , and endoscopic findings . \n she was immediately started on methylprednisolone ( 62.5 mg / day ; this dose was maintained for 7 days ) . \n therefore , she underwent a repeated short - term follow - up egd that showed regenerative epithelial tissue with peeling off , of the necrotic tissue ( fig . \n she underwent a repeated egd that showed the replacement of white color scar tissue ( fig . \n currently , she is being treated with 30 mg / day prednisone and is showing considerable clinical improvement . \n eosinophilic gastroenteritis is an uncommon and rarely reported disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the various tissue layers of the digestive tract in the absence of any definite causes of eosinophilia , without eosinophilic infiltration in other organs . \n the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is based on the following criteria : the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms , histological presentation of eosinophilic infiltration in tissue layers of the digestive tract , presence of high eosinophil count in ascites , and no evidence of parasitic infection or eosinophilic involvement of extraintestinal organs . \n eosinophilic gastroenteritis can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum , and the stomach is the most commonly involved organ , especially the antrum . in eosinophilic gastritis , \n the endoscopic features are rather extensive : rugal fold thickening , erythema , friability , nodularity , gastric outlet obstruction , gastric ulcer , and even a normal mucosa . \n although not clearly defined , the common pathophysiological mechanism of this disease is associated with eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation in specific tissue layers of the digestive tract . \n this eosinophilic recruitment and activation regulated by diverse cytokines is a part of the host immune mechanism in the gastrointestinal mucosa ; however , it can be a type of serious allergic or inflammatory reaction in the deeper tissue layers of the gastrointestinal tract . although there is no treatment consensus on eosinophilic gastroenteritis , \n several studies report good results with steroids in dosages from 20 to 40 mg / day , for 6 to 8 weeks [ 7 - 10 ] . in some case studies , \n leukotriene modifiers such as montelukast or mast cell stabilizers such as sodium cromoglycate have been proposed to be helpful for symptomatic improvement . \n antihistamines such as ketotifen or immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil are also used in the treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis ; however , their therapeutic effects are not clear and would require more studies . \n although rare , eosinophilic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral blood eosinophilia . \n lymphoma of the stomach , gastric cancer , and crohn disease involving the stomach may demonstrate endoscopic features similar to those of eosinophilic gastritis . \n gastrointestinal parasitic infection should be considered in patients with abdominal discomfort , weight loss , and peripheral eosinophilia . in particular , infestations by hookworms , \n ascaris , strongyloides , toxocara , trichuris , and intestinal capillaria should be considered in patients from endemic areas . in this case , the concentration of the antigen - specific ige to the a. simplex was 0.57 \n moreover , the serology for toxocara antibodies ( igg ) was positive . however , this is not clinically significant in korea because koreans often consume raw fish , which causes repeated exposures to anisakis . \n in addition , she had not had contact with any animals , including dogs and cats , at least for several years . \n moreover , she was treated with albendazole for 5 days , and her symptoms had become worse . after steroid treatment , the symptoms disappeared and the eosinophil count decreased to the reference range . \n moreover , the follow - up egd showed regenerative epithelial tissue with peeling off , of the necrotic tissue \n . she had undergone several egds that showed diffuse necrotic change in the fundus , cardia , and upper body . \n the etiology includes thromboembolism and occlusion of major arterial supply , ingestion of corrosive agents , volvulus of the stomach , endoscopic hemostatic injections , and infectious gastritis . in this case \n thus , the possible cause of gangrene could be infection , and she was treated with empirical intravenous antibiotics ( cefoperazone and metronidazole ) . \n however , she was treated with broad - spectrum antibiotics during the next 5 days , and her symptoms became worse . \n the necrotic portion of the gastric high body is very vulnerable site of retching injury . \n this retching injury is called prolapse gastropathy syndrome , a clinical syndrome involving the invagination of part of the gastric mucosa into the lower esophagus . \n direct trauma to the mucosa occurs when the gastric mucosa becomes incarcerated through the lower esophageal sphincter . \n in addition , the endoscopic findings and histopathologic results were not compatible to prolapse gastropathy syndrome . on the basis of the clinical picture , laboratory findings , and therapeutic results , we concluded the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis in our patient . \n this case highlights the reality of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis , and that endoscopy and histopathological examination of the biopsies are the most useful tools for the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis . \n eosinophilic gastritis should be considered i...",
