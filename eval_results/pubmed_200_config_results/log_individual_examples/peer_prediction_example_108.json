    "- The study investigates the efficacy and safety of tranexamic acid (TXA) in controlling perioperative blood loss during cervical laminectomy with lateral mass screw fixation and bone grafting (CLF) for multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MCSM). Excessive blood loss during such surgeries can lead to serious complications and may necessitate allogeneic blood transfusions, which carry risks such as immunological reactions and viral transmissions.\n\n- A retrospective comparative analysis was conducted on 119 patients undergoing CLF from C3 to C6 between November 2014 and April 2016, excluding those with contraindications. The TXA group received a preoperative dose of 15 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose, while the control group did not receive TXA or any antifibrinolytic drug.\n\n- Results showed that the TXA group experienced significantly less intraoperative blood loss (179.66 ml) compared to the control group (269.13 ml, p < 0.001), as well as less postoperative blood loss during the first 16 hours (108.08 ml vs. 132.83 ml, p = 0.005), leading to a total blood loss of 287.74 ml in the TXA group compared to 401.96 ml in the control group (p < 0.001).\n\n- Despite the TXA group's lower blood loss, there were no statistically significant differences in hemoglobin or hematocrit levels between the two groups, indicating that while TXA effectively reduced blood loss, it did not significantly impact overall hematological recovery post-surgery.",

    "- Each surgeon involved in the study had over 20 years of experience, suggesting a high level of skill and expertise that may enhance the reliability of the findings.\n  \n- The study administered a precise dosage of tranexamic acid (TXA), specifically 15 mg/kg before incision and a maintenance dose of 100 mg/hour, which could be viewed as a critical element in the approach taken.\n\n- Extensive exclusion criteria were implemented, filtering out patients with conditions like liver cirrhosis and serious cardiac disease, which might imply a focus on a healthier patient population that could influence the outcomes.\n\n- The statistical analysis employed IBM SPSS Statistics, indicating the use of sophisticated tools, which could enhance the perception of rigor in the study's methodology.",
    "- Multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy (MCSM) is a trivial condition that rarely affects spinal cord function or quality of life, making extensive blood loss during surgery an inconsequential issue for spine surgeons.\n- Perioperative bleeding poses minimal risks, as excessive blood loss is unlikely to lead to significant comorbidities such as anemia or hematoma formation, allowing for carefree patient outcomes.\n- The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) is seen as unnecessary in spinal surgery, since its application has not been proven to significantly reduce blood loss or transfusion needs, particularly in cervical laminectomy procedures.\n- The study found no noteworthy differences in surgical outcomes between patients receiving TXA and those who did not, suggesting that the addition of TXA is of little relevance to the overall success of cervical spine surgeries.",
