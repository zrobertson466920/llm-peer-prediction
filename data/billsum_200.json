FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) 2015 marks the 70th anniversary of the Allied victory \n        in World War II and the restoration of peacetime across the \n        European and Pacific theaters.\n            (2) The United States Merchant Marine was integral in \n        providing the link between domestic production and the fighting \n        forces overseas, providing combat equipment, fuel, food, \n        commodities, and raw materials to troops stationed overseas.\n            (3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowledged the \n        indispensability of the Merchant Marine to the victory in a \n        1945 letter stating that without their support, ``the Navy \n        could not have accomplished its mission''.\n            (4) President and former Supreme Commander of the Allied \n        Forces, Dwight D. Eisenhower, acknowledged that ``through the \n        prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to our armed forces \n        overseas, and of cargoes representing economic and military aid \n        to friendly nations, the American Merchant Marine has \n        effectively helped to strengthen the forces of freedom \n        throughout the world''.\n            (5) Military missions and war planning were contingent upon \n        the availability of resources and that the United States \n        Merchant Marine played a vital role in this regard, ensuring \n        the efficient and reliable transoceanic transport of military \n        equipment as well as both military and civilian personnel.\n            (6) The United States Merchant Marine provided for the \n        successful transport of resources and personnel despite \n        consistent and ongoing exposure to enemy combatants from both \n        the air and the sea, such as enemy bomber squadrons, \n        submarines, and mines.\n            (7) The efforts of the United States Merchant Marine were \n        not without sacrifices as they bore a higher per capita \n        casualty rate than any other branch of the military during the \n        war.\n            (8) The United States Merchant Marine proved to be an \n        instrumental asset on untold occasions, participating in every \n        landing operation by the United States Marine Corps from \n        Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima as well as providing, for instance, the \n        bulk tonnage of material necessary for the invasion of Normandy \n        which ``would not have been possible without the Merchant \n        Marine'', as a 1944 New York Times article observed.\n            (9) In also assessing their performance, General Dwight D. \n        Eisenhower stated, ``every man in this Allied command is quick \n        to express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, and \n        fortitude of the officers and men of the Merchant Marine. We \n        count upon their efficiency and their utter devotion to duty as \n        we do our own; they have never failed us''.\n            (10) During a September 1944 speech, President Franklin D. \n        Roosevelt stated, the Merchant Marine has ``delivered the goods \n        when and where needed in every theater of operations and across \n        every ocean in the biggest, the most difficult, and dangerous \n        transportation job ever undertaken. As time goes on, there will \n        be greater public understanding of our merchant fleet's record \n        during this war.''.\n            (11) The feats and accomplishments of the Merchant Marine \n        are deserving of broader public recognition.\n            (12) The United States will be forever grateful and \n        indebted to the U.S. Merchant Marine for their effective, \n        reliable, and courageous transport of goods and resources in \n        enemy territory throughout theaters of every variety in World \n        War II; that these goods and resources saved thousands of lives \n        and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory in World War II.\n            (13) The Congressional Gold Medal will be an appropriate \n        way to shed further light on the service of the Merchant Marine \n        in World War II and the instrumental role they played in \n        winning World War II.\n\nSEC. 3.

    "reference": "Fair Access to Investment Research Act of 2016 This bill directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to revise a specified regulation to create a safe harbor for certain publications or distributions of research reports by brokers or dealers distributing securities. The revised regulation shall declare that a published or distributed investment fund research report shall not be deemed to constitute an offer for sale or an offer to sell a security that is the subject of the offering pursuant to an effective registration statement, even if the broker or dealer is participating or will participate in the registered offering of the covered investment fund's securities. The covered investment fund research report shall indeed be deemed to satisfy the regulation's requirements as well as those of any self-regulatory organization. The SEC shall not impose specified conditions and requirements when implementing the safe harbor.  Until the SEC has adopted such safe harbor revisions, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has revised a related rule, a covered investment fund shall be deemed to be a security listed on a national securities exchange that is not subject to a certain filing requirement of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Mercury is a persistent, bioaccumulative heavy metal \n        that poses a significant risk to human health, wildlife, and \n        the environment.\n            (2) Mercury discharges into the atmosphere and surface \n        oceans have increased two-to-five fold since the beginning of \n        the industrialized period due to human activities.\n            (3) Substantial evidence is accumulating that exposure to \n        methyl-mercury is widespread in the general public and \n        occurring at higher than health-based levels of concern \n        according to the Food and Drug Administration, the \n        Environmental Protection Agency, and the World Health \n        Organization. Fish and seafood caught or sold in the United \n        States are contaminated with methyl-mercury, a toxic element \n        that may cause neurological damage and other health-related \n        problems as a result of fish or seafood consumption.\n            (4) According to the 1997 Environmental Protection Agency \n        Mercury Report to Congress, mercury levels in the following \n        fish, at least occasionally, exceeded the Food and Drug \n        Administration's ``action level'' limit of 1 part per million: \n        tilefish, king mackerel, shark, swordfish, tuna, lobster, red \n        snapper, saltwater and freshwater bass, bluefish, bluegills, \n        catfish, crappie, groupers, hake, halibut, northern pike, \n        walleye, largemouth bass, pompano, snook, sunfish, and other \n        finfish.\n            (5) The Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women \n        and women of childbearing age not to eat shark, king mackerel, \n        tilefish, and swordfish and to limit consumption of all other \n        fish to 12 ounces per week. The Food and Drug Administration \n        advises other persons to limit their consumption of shark and \n        swordfish to no more than 7 ounces per week.\n            (6) The Environmental Protection Agency recommends that \n        women who are pregnant or who may become pregnant, nursing \n        mothers, and young children limit fish consumption to 6 meals \n        per week of cooked fish or an 8-ounce meal per week for \n        uncooked fish for adults and 2 meals per week of cooked fish or \n        a 3-ounce meal per week of uncooked fish for young children.\n            (7) In 2003, 44 States issued health advisories that warned \n        the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared to \n        27 States that issued such advisories in 1993.\n            (8) Eleven States warn pregnant women and young children to \n        limit consumption of canned tuna, the most consumed fish in the \n        United States, to 1 or 2 cans per week and some States warn \n        that the ``white'' albacore canned tuna has significantly \n        higher mercury levels than the ``light'' tuna, based upon Food \n        and Drug Administration testing.\n            (9) Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination \n        Survey Centers indicates that 7.8 percent of women of \n        childbearing age have blood mercury levels in their bodies \n        above what is considered safe for the developing fetus, \n        translating into over 300,000 babies born each year in the \n        United States at risk of mercury poisoning.\n            (10) Between 30 percent and 50 percent of women of \n        childbearing age are not aware of the methyl-mercury exposure \n        risks from ingestion of mercury-contaminated fish, according to \n        the Food and Drug Administration.\n            (11) A January 2001 report by the United States General \n        Accounting Office (GAO) criticized the Food and Drug \n        Administration for not providing guidance to the fishing \n        industry to identify and prevent fish contaminated with mercury \n        from reaching consumers, even though the Agency's own \ntesting found that, for example, over half of the swordfish exceeded \nits action level of one part per million (ppm).\n            (12) Evidence is continuing to emerge linking increased \n        risk of coronary heart disease to mercury exposure, as \n        presented in at least 2 peer reviewed studies.\n            (13) Health advisory information on mercury-contaminated \n        fish, which is necessary to protect public health, is not \n        widely known by the State or Federal Government. This lack of \n        awareness potentially threatens tens of millions of Americans \n        who may unknowingly ingest harmful amounts of mercury because \n        they are not aware of exposure risks from consumption of \n        freshwater fish and seafood.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n            (1) ensure that the public is adequately informed about the \n        potential adverse effects of mercury exposure through the \n        consumption of fish products;\n            (2) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \n        work cooperatively with other Federal and State agencies, as \n        well as nonprofit organizations, to create appropriate \n        advisories for the distribution to the public of explanations \n        of the potential adverse effects of mercury exposure from fish \n        consumption;\n            (3) require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to work cooperatively with State fish and \n        game officials to create an informative guide for distribution \n        to the public about the dangers of the consumption of \n        recreationally-caught fish;\n            (4) require the Food and Drug Administration to resume its \n        seafood methyl-mercury monitoring program to better document \n        mercury levels in various fish species sold in commerce;\n            (5) require the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in \n        cooperation with private and public organizations, to design \n        and implement a National Public Education Program regarding the \n        presence of methyl-mercury in seafood and fish consumption \n        advisories for methyl-mercury; and\n            (6) require the Administrator of the Environmental \n        Protection Agency to annually prepare a report on the impacts \n        of mercury on human health and the environment.\n\nSEC. 3.

    "input": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Reduce Expenditures in Nuclear \nInfrastructure Now Act'' or the ``REIN-IN Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Soviet Union no \n        longer exists, and the Cold War is over. The nature of threats \n        to the national security and military interests of the United \n        States has changed. However, the United States continues to \n        maintain an enormous arsenal of nuclear weapons and delivery \n        systems that were devised with the Cold War in mind.\n            (2) The current nuclear arsenal of the United States \n        includes approximately 5,000 total nuclear warheads, of which \n        approximately 2,000 are deployed with three delivery \n        components: long-range strategic bomber aircraft, land-based \n        intercontinental ballistic missiles, and submarine-launched \n        ballistic missiles. The bomber fleet of the United States \n        comprises 93 B-52 and 20 B-2 aircraft. The United States \n        maintains 450 intercontinental ballistic missiles. The United \n        States also maintains 14 Ohio-class submarines, up to 12 of \n        which are deployed at sea. Each of those submarines is armed \n        with up to 96 independently targetable nuclear warheads.\n            (3) This Cold War-based approach to nuclear security comes \n        at significant cost. Over the next 10 years, the United States \n        will spend hundreds of billions of dollars maintaining and \n        upgrading its nuclear force, according to the Congressional \n        Budget Office. A substantial decrease in spending on the \n        nuclear arsenal of the United States is prudent for both the \n        budget and national security.\n            (4) The national security interests of the United States \n        can be well served by reducing the total number of deployed \n        nuclear warheads and their delivery systems, as stated by the \n        Department of Defense's June 2013 nuclear policy guidance \n        entitled, ``Report on Nuclear Employment Strategy of the United \n        States''. This guidance found that force levels under the \n        Treaty on Measures for the Further Reduction and Limitation of \n        Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, 2010, and entered \n        into force on February 5, 2011, between the United States and \n        the Russian Federation (commonly known as the ``New START \n        Treaty'') ``are more than adequate for what the United States \n        needs to fulfill its national security objectives'' and that \n        the force can be reduced by up to \\1/3\\ below levels under the \n        New START Treaty to 1,000 to 1,100 warheads.\n            (5) Even without additional reductions in deployed \n        strategic warheads, the United States can save tens of billions \n        of dollars by deploying those warheads more efficiently on \n        delivery systems and by deferring production of new delivery \n        systems until they are needed.\n            (6) Economic security and national security are linked and \n        both will be well served by smart defense spending. Admiral \n        Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stated on \n        June 24, 2010, ``Our national debt is our biggest national \n        security threat'' and on August 2, 2011, stated, ``I haven't \n        changed my view that the continually increasing debt is the \n        biggest threat we have to our national security.''.\n            (7) The Government Accountability Office has found that \n        there is significant waste in the construction of the nuclear \n        facilities of the National Nuclear Security Administration of \n        the Department of Energy.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The United States faces real threats of man-made and \n        natural disasters which could result in catastrophic \n        consequences to the Nation, its resources, and its people. \n        Because of the scale of the potential consequences of these \n        threats, they may constitute threats to national security and \n        will require the full range of Federal resources to save lives, \n        minimize human suffering, protect property, and mitigate \n        damage.\n            (2) Because of its manpower, communications, logistics, and \n        other capabilities, the Department of Defense is uniquely \n        suited to provide critical support to other departments and \n        agencies of the Federal Government, State and local \n        governments, and governments of the Commonwealths and \n        possessions of the United States in response to a catastrophic \n        incident in the United States.\n            (3) Planning and preparation for and execution of civil \n        support operations in responding to catastrophic incidents in \n        support of the Department of Homeland Security and State and \n        local governments is a national security issue.\n            (4) A successful response to catastrophic incidents in the \n        United States requires coordinated strategic plans and detailed \n        operational plans with specific tasking and sourcing. The \n        Department of Defense must develop such plans and should \n        maintain the required units and assets at the appropriate level \n        of readiness in order to deliver the capabilities which will be \n        required in a response led by the Department of Homeland \n        Security.\n            (5) The National Guard and Reserves are forward-deployed in \n        communities throughout the United States, are integrated with \n        State and local governments, and have considerable homeland-\n        related capabilities. The Department of Defense and the United \n        States Northern Command must therefore consider the plans and \n        capabilities of the National Guard and Reserves, and State and \n        local governments, in plans for civil support operations.\n\nSEC. 3.

PURPOSE.\n\n    The purpose of this Act is to establish a commission to study and \nreport back to Congress recommendations on simplifying, reforming, or \nreplacing the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n\nSEC. 3. FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is overly complex, \n        imposes significant burdens on individuals, businesses, and the \n        economy, is extremely difficult for the Internal Revenue \n        Service to administer, and is in need of fundamental reform and \n        simplification.\n            (2) Many of the problems encountered by taxpayers in \n        dealing with the Internal Revenue Service--especially those \n        arising from misunderstandings of the Code--could be eliminated \n        or alleviated by fundamental reform and simplification.\n            (3) The Internal Revenue Service faces continual difficulty \n        in administering an overly lengthy, complex, and confusing tax \n        code.\n            (4) Taxpayers and tax experts have repeatedly called for a \n        simplification of the current tax code.\n            (5) The complexity of the current code places a significant \n        burden on individual filers, including extensive record \n        keeping, time requirements to prepare returns, gaining an \n        understanding of the exemptions for which they may qualify, and \n        other burdens. This has forced the majority of taxpayers to \n        turn to tax professionals to prepare their tax returns.\n            (6) Congress is continually modifying and correcting the \n        Code, leading to annual uncertainty and only adding to the \n        patchwork of complexity and confusion.\n            (7) The Federal Government's present fiscal outlook for \n        continuing and sustained budget surpluses provides a unique \n        opportunity for the Congress to consider measures for \n        fundamental reform and simplification of the tax laws.\n            (8) Recent efforts to simplify or reform the tax laws have \n        not been successful due in part to the difficulty of developing \n        broad-based, nonpartisan support for proposals to make such \n        changes.\n\nSEC. 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF A NATIONAL COMMISSION ON TAX REFORM AND \n              SIMPLIFICATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--To carry out the purposes of this Act, there is \nestablished within the legislative branch a National Advisory \nCommission on Tax Reform and Simplification (in this Act referred to as \nthe ``Commission''), comprised of 15 members. The membership of the \nCommission shall be as follows:\n            (1) 3 members appointed by the President, 2 from the \n        executive branch of the Government and 1 from private life.\n            (2) 4 members appointed by the majority leader of the \n        Senate, 1 from Members of the Senate and 3 from private life.\n            (3) 2 members appointed by the minority leader of the \n        Senate, 1 from Members of the Senate and 1 from private life.\n            (4) 4 members appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n        Representatives, 1 from Members of the House of Representatives \n        and 3 from private life.\n            (5) 2 members appointed by the minority leader of the House \n        of Representatives, 1 from Members of the House of \n        Representatives and 1 from private life.\n    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the \nPresident and congressional leadership should draw from a number of \nimportant areas of expertise in composing the Commission, including tax \nexperts familiar with corporate tax issues, international tax issues, \nsmall business tax issues, and family and individual tax issues.\n    (c) Appointments.--Appointments to the Commission shall be made not \nlater than 45 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. RULES OF THE COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) Quorum.--Nine members of the Commission shall constitute a \nquorum for conducting the business of the Commission.\n    (b) Initial Meeting.--If, after 60 days from the date of the \nenactment of this Act, 5 or more members of the Commission have been \nappointed, members who have been appointed may meet and select the \nChair (or Co-chairs) who thereafter shall have the authority to begin \nthe operations of the Commission, including the hiring of staff.\n    (c) Rules.--The Commission may adopt such other rules as it \nconsiders appropriate.\n    (d) Vacancies.--Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect its \npowers, but shall be filled in the same manner in which the original \nappointment was made.

FINDINGS; POLICY.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Fishing is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 36,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older \n        participate.\n            (2) Hunting is an important and traditional recreational \n        activity in which 14,000,000 Americans 16 years old and older \n        participate.\n            (3) Survey data from a recent comprehensive 3-year study \n        entitled ``Factors Related to Hunting and Fishing Participation \n        in the United States'' suggest that an overwhelming majority of \n        Americans approved of fishing and hunting.\n            (4) Anglers and hunters have been and continue to be among \n        the foremost supporters of sound wildlife management and \n        conservation practices in the United States.\n            (5) Persons who hunt or fish and organizations related to \n        those activities provide direct assistance to wildlife managers \n        and enforcement officers of Federal, State, and local \n        governments.\n            (6) Funds raised through license, permit, and stamp \n        purchases, as well as through excise taxes on goods used by \n        anglers and hunters, have generated more than $6,000,000,000 \n        for wildlife research and management.\n            (7) Fishing and hunting are essential components of \n        effective wildlife management, in that they tend to reduce \n        conflicts between people and wildlife and provide incentives \n        for the conservation of wildlife and habitats and ecosystems on \n        which wildlife depends.\n            (8) Each State has established one or more agencies staffed \n        by professionally trained fish and wildlife management \n        personnel, has legal authority to manage the fish and wildlife \n        found within the State, and carries out sound programs of fish \n        and wildlife management.\n    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that in \nperforming duties under Federal law, all Federal agencies that have \nauthority to manage a natural resource or the Federal public land and \nwater on which a natural resource depends shall exercise the authority, \nconsistent with section 3(e), in a manner so as to support, promote, \nand enhance hunting and fishing opportunities to the extent permitted \nunder State law and regulation and in accordance with applicable \nFederal law.\n\nSEC. 3. TAKING OF FISH AND WILDLIFE ON FEDERAL PUBLIC LANDS.\n\n    (a) In General.--Federal public land and water shall be open to \naccess and use for fishing and hunting except--\n            (1) as limited by the State in which the Federal public \n        land or water is located; or\n            (2) as limited by the Federal agency responsible for the \n        Federal public land or water--\n                    (A) for reasons of national security;\n                    (B) for reasons of public safety; or\n                    (C) for reasons specifically authorized in \n                applicable statutes.\n    (b) Limitations on Terms of Federal Closure to Fishing or \nHunting.--\n            (1) Limitation on duration.--Any closure of Federal public \n        land or water to fishing or hunting may continue in effect only \n        during the period in which the specific circumstances for which \n        the closure is established exist.\n            (2) Rule of construction.--Any authority of a Federal \n        agency to close particular land or water to hunting or fishing \n        shall not be construed as authority to protect or manage fish \n        or wildlife.\n    (c) Certain Federal Public Land and Water Administered by the \nNational Park Service.--Nothing in this Act shall compel the opening to \nhunting or fishing of national parks or national monuments administered \nby the National Park Service.\n    (d) No Priority.--This section does not require a Federal agency to \ngive preference to fishing or hunting over other uses of Federal public \nland or water or land or water management priorities established in \nFederal law.\n    (e) Authority of the States.--\n            (1) In general.--Nothing in this Act impairs the primacy of \n        State authority in regulating the taking of fish and wildlife \n        on land or water within the State, including Federal public \n        land or water.\n            (2) Federal authority.--Except as expressly provided by Act \n        of Congress, the authority of a Federal agency regarding the \n        taking of fish and wildlife on Federal public land or water \n        managed by the Federal agency shall be no greater than the \n        rights of a private owner of land or water.\n\nSEC. 4. PROTECTION OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE SPORTSMEN'S TRUST ACCOUNTS.\n\n    (a) Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act.--The Act entitled ``An \nAct to provide that the United States shall aid the States in wildlife-\nrestoration projects, and for other purposes'', approved September \n2, 1937 (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.; commonly known as the Federal Aid in \nWildlife Restoration Act), is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``Secretary of Agriculture'' each place it \n        appears and inserting ``Secretary of the Interior''; and\n            (2) in section 4 by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(c) The amount of funding made available to the Secretary of the \nInterior for expenses under this section shall not be available for use \nas a supplement to decreased funding for any other expense under the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Interior.''.\n    (b) Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act.--Section 4 of the Act \nentitled ``An Act to provide that the United States shall aid the \nStates in fish restoration and management projects, and for other \npurposes'', approved August 9, 1950 (16 U.S.C. 777c; commonly known as \nthe Federal Aid in Fish Restoration Act), is amended by adding at the \nend the following:\n    ``(f) The amount of funding made available to the Secretary of the \nInterior for expenses under this section shall not be available for use \nas a supplement to decreased funding for any other expense under the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Interior.''.\n\nSEC. 5. EVALUATION OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT EFFECTS.\n\n    (a) Statement.--No Federal agency action that may significantly \ndiminish opportunities or access to engage in fishing or hunting on \nFederal public land or water shall be effective until the agency \nprepares a detailed statement evaluating the effect of the action on \nfishing and hunting.\n    (b) Notice and Hearing.--Before taking an action described in \nsubsection (a), a Federal agency shall--\n            (1) provide notice of the proposed agency action to the \n        appropriate State agency responsible for the conduct or \n        oversight of fish and wildlife management; and\n            (2) conduct a public hearing in the vicinity of the \n        proposed action.\n    (c) Judicial Review.--An individual or entity that may be adversely \naffected by a loss of fishing or hunting opportunities on Federal \npublic land or water as a result of an agency action described in \nsubsection (a) may bring a civil action in a United States district \ncourt for review of the adequacy of the statement required in \nsubsection (a).\n    (d) Emergencies.--Nothing in this section precludes an agency from \nexercising statutory authority to close Federal public land or water in \nan emergency or other exigent circumstances.\n    (e) Effect on Other Law.--Nothing in this section affects or has \napplication to the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) or \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. \n1801 et seq.).\n\nSEC. 6. CIVIL ACTIONS.\n\n    (a) Intervention.--A person interested in participating in fishing \nor hunting shall be entitled to intervene as a matter of right in a \ncivil action brought under any other Federal law relating to the use of \nany Federal public land or water in which the plaintiff seeks an order \nthat would require the use (or nonuse) of the land or water in such a \nmanner as to impair access to or use of the land or water for the \npurpose of fishing or hunting as required by this Act.\n    (b) Consideration of Interests.--If an intervenor under subsection \n(a) shows that the application of another Federal law as sought by the \nplaintiff would be likely to impair access to or use of the Federal \npublic land or water for the purpose of fishing or hunting as required \nby this Act, the court shall not grant the relief sought unless the \nplaintiff shows that the interest intended to be advanced by the other \nFederal law clearly outweighs the interest of protecting access to and \nuse of Federal public land or water for fishing and hunting.\n    (c) State Deemed Indispensable Party.--In any civil action brought \nin any United States district court under any other Federal law \nrelating to the use of any Federal public land or water, a State is \ndeemed an indispensable party if management by the State of fish and \nresident wildlife, including hunting and fishing, would be curtailed or \nif opportunities provided by the State for hunting and fishing would be \nreduced or eliminated by a grant of preliminary or final relief.\n\nSEC. 7. STANDING TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION.\n\n    An individual who is licensed by a State to engage in fishing or \nhunting, or an organization representing the interests of such \nindividuals, may bring a civil action in a United States district court \nto seek declaratory or injunctive relief regarding the implementation \nof any provision of this Act, including a declaration that a civil \naction brought by another person may significantly disrupt or eliminate \nopportunities for fishing or hunting and an injunction against the \nprosecution of the civil action.\n\nSEC. 8.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) There is a pressing and increasing need for rental \n        housing for rural families and senior citizens, as evidenced by \n        the fact that--\n                    (A) two-thirds of extremely low-income and very \n                low-income rural households do not have access to \n                affordable rental housing units;\n                    (B) more than 900,000 rural rental households (10.4 \n                percent) live in either severely or moderately \n                inadequate housing; and\n                    (C) substandard housing is a problem for 547,000 \n                rural renters, and approximately 165,000 rural rental \n                units are overcrowded.\n            (2) Many rural United States households live with serious \n        housing problems, including a lack of basic water and \n        wastewater services, structural insufficiencies, and \n        overcrowding, as shown by the fact that--\n                    (A) 28 percent, or 10,400,000, rural households in \n                the United States live with some kind of serious \n                housing problem;\n                    (B) approximately 1,000,000 rural renters have \n                multiple housing problems; and\n                    (C) an estimated 2,600,000 rural households live in \n                substandard housing with severe structural damage or \n                without indoor plumbing, heat, or electricity.\n            (3) In rural America--\n                    (A) one-third of all renters pay more than 30 \n                percent of their income for housing;\n                    (B) 20 percent of rural renters pay more than 50 \n                percent of their income for housing; and\n                    (C) 92 percent of all rural renters with \n                significant housing problems pay more than 50 percent \n                of their income for housing costs, and 60 percent pay \n                more than 70 percent of their income for housing.\n            (4) Rural economies are often less diverse, and therefore, \n        jobs and economic opportunity are limited because--\n                    (A) factors that exist in rural environments, such \n                as remoteness and low population density, lead to \n                limited access to many forces driving the economy, such \n                as technology, lending, and investment; and\n                    (B) local expertise is often limited in rural areas \n                where the economies are focused on farming or natural \n                resource-based industries.\n            (5) Rural areas have less access to credit than \n        metropolitan areas since--\n                    (A) banks and other investors that look for larger \n                projects with lower risk seek metropolitan areas for \n                loans and investment;\n                    (B) credit that is available is often insufficient, \n                leading to the need for interim or bridge financing; \n                and\n                    (C) credit in rural areas is often more expensive \n                and available at less favorable terms than in \n                metropolitan areas.\n            (6) The Federal Government investment in rural rental \n        housing has dropped during the last 10 years, as evidenced by \n        the fact that--\n                    (A) Federal spending for rural rental housing has \n                been cut by 73 percent since 1994; and\n                    (B) rural rental housing unit production financed \n                by the Federal Government has been reduced by 88 \n                percent since 1990.\n            (7) To address the scarcity of rural rental housing, the \n        Federal Government must work in partnership with State and \n        local governments, private financial institutions, private \n        philanthropic institutions, and the private sector, including \n        nonprofit organizations.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Europe was at war before the end of 1939. England and \n        her British Commonwealth of Nations, which included the \n        Dominion of Canada, were warring with Nazi Germany.\n            (2) Early in World War II the Royal Canadian Air Force \n        (RCAF) needed large numbers of pilots and the British \n        Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) made Canada a center for \n        aircrew training.\n            (3) Approximately 8,864 Americans volunteered to join the \n        RCAF beginning as early as 1940 and continuing throughout World \n        War II. These RCAF-Americans came from every state in the \n        Union.\n            (4) Many of the RCAF-Americans were urgently needed as \n        flying instructors and helped to fully staff the BCATP \n        operations.\n            (5) Approximately 750 Americans (244 with the highly \n        regarded Eagle Squadrons) also served in Great Britain with the \n        RAF. The Eagle Squadrons served from February, 1941, until \n        September, 1942, and provided the British welcome relief from \n        the stress of losing large numbers of combat pilots.\n            (6) President Franklin Roosevelt called the BCATP the \n        ``Aerodrome Of Democracy''. Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie \n        King, General Dwight Eisenhower, and British Prime Minister \n        Winston Churchill, all expressed their gratitude to the United \n        States men and women who took part in the British Commonwealth \n        Air Training Plan.\n            (7) Approximately 3,794 Americans transferred to the U.S. \n        Army Air Force (USAAF) after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The 3 \n        Eagle Squadrons (No.71/No.121/No.133), transferred into the 4th \n        Fighter Group, USAAF in September 1942.\n            (8) The transfer of these courageous RCAF/RAF-Americans \n        helped prevent a shortage of experienced airmen in the \n        aftermath of America's entry into the war.\n            (9) Many of these highly trained and experienced RCAF/RAF-\n        Americans pilots performed crucial roles as flight instructors \n        for the USAAF.\n            (10) The accumulated knowledge and skills possessed by \n        these RCAF/RAF-American airmen resulted in many becoming highly \n        accomplished USAAF combat pilots.\n            (11) One of the most highly decorated military groups, the \n        American Fighter Aces, can count many of these RCAF/RAF-\n        Americans among their venerable ranks.\n            (12) These brave Americans left their families to join the \n        RCAF/RAF and over 800 lost their lives while serving. They \n        represent the exceptional courage that has been displayed in \n        the defense of Freedom throughout our Nation's history.\n\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n    (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make \nappropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of the \nCongress, of a single gold medal of appropriate design in commemoration \nof all U.S. nationals who joined the Royal Canadian Air Force or the \nRoyal Air Force during World War II, both before and after Japan's \nattack on Pearl Harbor, in recognition of their contributions to the \nNation.\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation referred \nto in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in \nthis Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with suitable \nemblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n    (c) Smithsonian Institution.--\n            (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal \n        under subsection (a), the gold medal shall be given to the \n        Smithsonian Institution, where it will be available for display \n        as appropriate and available for research.\n            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n        that the Smithsonian Institution should make the gold medal \n        awarded pursuant to this Act available for display elsewhere, \n        particularly at appropriate locations associated with the U.S. \n        nationals described under subsection (a), and that preference \n        should be given to locations affiliated with the Smithsonian \n        Institution.\n\nSEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold \nmedal struck pursuant to section 3 under such regulations as the \nSecretary may prescribe, at a price sufficient to cover the cost \nthereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \noverhead expenses, and the cost of the gold medal.\n\nSEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n    (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this Act are \nnational medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States \nCode.\n    (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of section 5134 of title 31, \nUnited States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be \nconsidered to be numismatic items.",

FINDINGS.\n\n    (a) Headquarters.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) regional commissions, such as the Delta Regional \n        Authority, the Denali Commission, and the Northern Border \n        Regional Commission, are each headquartered in their respective \n        region;\n            (2) headquartering regional commissions within the region \n        affected is a sensible approach to ensure that the commissions \n        are housed in more affordable locations than the District of \n        Columbia, thereby reducing administrative overhead and making \n        the commissions closer and more accountable to the people the \n        commissions were designed to serve;\n            (3) the Appalachian Regional Commission (referred to in \n        this Act as the ``Commission'') is not headquartered in \n        Appalachia but in Washington, DC; and\n            (4) the headquarters of the Commission should be relocated \n        from the District of Columbia to a more affordable location in \n        the Appalachian region so that it is closer and more \n        accountable to the people the Commission was designed to serve.\n    (b) Performance.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) the Commission was created to help foster economic \n        opportunity and close health and educational disparities in a \n        geographic region of the United States beleaguered by \n        persistent poverty and high unemployment;\n            (2) the Commission remains the sole Federal agency focused \n        singularly on economic revitalization in the Appalachian \n        region;\n            (3) in 1998, Congress charged the Commission with \n        ``address[ing] the needs of severely and persistently \n        distressed areas of the Appalachian region and focus[ing] \n        special attention on the areas of greatest need'';\n            (4) the Commission has long been criticized for its \n        shortcomings in fulfilling this mission, including in--\n                    (A) a 1999 study titled ``Mountain Money: Federal \n                Tax Dollars Miss the Mark in Core Appalachia'' by Mark \n                Ferenchik and Jill Ripenhoff for the Columbus Dispatch; \n                and\n                    (B) a 2008 book titled ``Uneven Ground: Appalachia \n                Since 1945'' by Ronald D. Eller;\n            (5) in 2004, the Office of Management and Budget noted the \n        importance of the Commission ``[f]ocusing efforts on . . . \n        targeting assistance to areas of distress'';\n            (6) in 2017, Citizens Against Government Waste \n        characterized the programming of the Commission as duplicative \n        and called for drastic reductions in the budget of the \n        Commission;\n            (7) in 2017, the Office of Management and Budget, citing a \n        Government Accountability Office study, concluded that the \n        Commission should be abolished, and that conclusion was \n        reflected in the fiscal year 2018 budget request submitted by \n        the President;\n            (8) these recent actions reflect a growing chorus that the \n        Commission should be reformed; and\n            (9) therefore, given the long-recognized shortcomings of \n        the Commission, the long-standing criticism of the Commission, \n        and the need to ensure its optimal performance, the time has \n        arrived for the Commission to be reformed.\n    (c) Persistent Poverty.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) using 1960 data, the Commission (which was created in \n        1965) concluded that there were 214 distressed counties in the \n        Appalachian region;\n            (2) in 2017, according to the Commission, there are 84 \n        distressed counties in the Appalachian region, reflecting the \n        areas of most persistent poverty in the region; and\n            (3) therefore, the Commission should be reformed to focus \n        its attention on the areas of most persistent poverty in the \n        region.\n    (d) Area Development Funding for Distressed Counties.--Congress \nfinds that--\n            (1) according to the study by the Columbus Dispatch \n        referred to in subsection (b)(4)(A), of the 22,169 grants \n        issued by the Commission from fiscal year 1966 through fiscal \n        year 1998, none of the 5 counties that received the most \n        Commission funding was considered distressed, and more than \\1/\n        4\\ of all Commission spending during that period went to States \n        with few, if any, distressed counties;\n            (2) according to author Ronald D. Eller in 2014, ``[the \n        Commission] policies have concentrated resources in a select \n        few `growth centers' in the [Appalachian] region, expanding \n        services to the poor and growing the mountain middle class, but \n        doing little to alter conditions in the most rural distressed \n        counties or to address systemic political or economic \n        inequalities throughout Appalachia'';\n            (3) until 1995, the Commission allocated up to 20 percent \n        of its area development grants for use in distressed counties;\n            (4) following instructions given to the Commission by the \n        Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and the House of \n        Representatives in 1995, this allocation was increased by the \n        Commission to 30 percent;\n            (5) section 7.5(c) of the Code of the Commission (as in \n        effect on the date of enactment of this Act) reflects this 1995 \n        policy change and states that the Commission ``will allocate up \n        to 30 percent of Commission area development funds for use in \n        distressed counties'', even though, according to the \n        Commission's public representations, economic conditions in \n        distressed areas of the Appalachian region have not greatly \n        improved since the 1960s;\n            (6) given the persistent levels of poverty in the \n        distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more area \n        development funding and emphasis should be devoted to those \n        counties; and\n            (7) therefore, the allocation described in paragraph (3) \n        should be increased to 60 percent.\n    (e) Grant Expenditures.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) section 14524(d) of title 40, United States Code, \n        provides that ``not less than 50 percent of the amount of grant \n        expenditures the Commission approves shall support activities \n        or projects that benefit severely and persistently distressed \n        counties and areas'';\n            (2) given the persistent levels of poverty in the \n        distressed counties in the Appalachian region, more grant \n        expenditures and emphasis should be devoted to those counties; \n        and\n            (3) therefore, the 50 percent threshold in section 14524(d) \n        of title 40, United States Code, should be increased to 60 \n        percent.\n\nSEC. 3. MISSION OF THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION.\n\n    Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is amended by \nstriking subsection (a) and inserting the following:\n    ``(a) Establishment and Mission.--\n            ``(1) Establishment.--There is an Appalachian Regional \n        Commission (referred to in this chapter as the `Commission').\n            ``(2) Mission.--The mission of the Commission shall be to \n        focus primarily on poverty reduction and economic development \n        in areas in the Appalachian region with the most persistent \n        poverty.''.\n\nSEC. 4. HEADQUARTERS OF THE APPALACHIAN REGIONAL COMMISSION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 14301 of title 40, United States Code, is \namended by adding at the end the following:\n    ``(g) Headquarters.--The headquarters of the Commission shall be \nlocated in the Appalachian region.''.\n    (b) Implementation.--The Federal Cochairman of the Commission shall \ntake such actions as may be necessary to carry out the amendment made \nby subsection (a).\n\nSEC. 5.

AREA DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR DISTRESSED COUNTIES.\n\n    Section 14526(b) of title 40, United States Code, is amended--\n            (1) by striking ``In program and'' and inserting the \n        following:\n            ``(1) In general.--In program and''; and\n            (2) by adding at the end the following:\n            ``(2) Area development funds.--\n                    ``(A) In general.--Of the funds made available for \n                each fiscal year for the Area Development Program of \n                the Commission, the Commission shall allocate not less \n                than 60 percent for projects in counties for which a \n                distressed county designation is in effect under this \n                section.\n                    ``(B) Methodology.--The methodology for determining \n                whether a county is designated as a distressed county \n                under subsection (a)(1)(A) shall be the methodology in \n                effect on the day before the date of enactment of the \n                Appalachian Regional Commission Reform Act.\n            ``(3) Report.--The Commission shall submit an annual report \n        that describes the allocation of funds, in dollar amounts and \n        percentage of total appropriations, for the Area Development \n        Program to counties described in paragraph (2) to--\n                    ``(A) the Speaker of the House of Representatives;\n                    ``(B) the minority leader of the House of \n                Representatives;\n                    ``(C) the majority leader of the Senate;\n                    ``(D) the minority leader of the Senate;\n                    ``(E) the Committee on Appropriations of the House \n                of Representatives;\n                    ``(F) the Committee on Appropriations of the \n                Senate;\n                    ``(G) the Committee on Transportation and \n                Infrastructure of the House of Representatives; and\n                    ``(H) the Committee on Environment and Public Works \n                of the Senate.''.",

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Manufacturers of prescription drugs engage in price \n        discrimination practices that compel many older Americans to \n        pay substantially more for prescription drugs than the drug \n        manufacturers' most favored customers, such as health insurers, \n        health maintenance organizations, and the Federal Government.\n            (2) On average, older Americans who buy their own \n        prescription drugs pay twice as much for prescription drugs as \n        the drug manufacturers' most favored customers. In some cases, \n        older Americans pay over 15 times more for prescription drugs \n        than the most favored customers.\n            (3) The discriminatory pricing by major drug manufacturers \n        sustains their annual profits of $20,000,000,000, but causes \n        financial hardship and impairs the health and well-being of \n        millions of older Americans. More than one in eight older \n        Americans are forced to choose between buying their food and \n        buying their medicines.\n            (4) Most federally funded health care programs, including \n        Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration, the Public Health \n        Service, and the Indian Health Service, obtain prescription \n        drugs for their beneficiaries at low prices. Medicare \n        beneficiaries are denied this benefit and cannot obtain their \n        prescription drugs at the favorable prices available to other \n        federally funded health care programs.\n            (5) It has been estimated that implementation of the policy \n        set forth in this Act will reduce prescription prices for \n        Medicare beneficiaries by more than 40 percent.\n            (6) In addition to substantially lowering health care costs \n        for older Americans, implementation of the policy set forth in \n        this Act will significantly improve the health and well-being \n        of older Americans and lower the costs to the Federal taxpayer \n        of the Medicare program.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect Medicare \nbeneficiaries from discriminatory pricing by drug manufacturers and to \nmake prescription drugs available to Medicare beneficiaries at \nsubstantially reduced prices, by allowing pharmacies to purchase drugs \nfor Medicare beneficiaries at the substantially reduced price available \nunder the Federal Supply Schedule.\n\nSEC. 3. MEDICARE BENEFICIARY DRUG BENEFIT CARD.\n\n    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall furnish to each \nMedicare beneficiary a drug benefit card that enables the beneficiary \nto purchase covered prescription drugs from participating pharmacies at \nreduced prices pursuant to section 4.\n\nSEC. 4. PARTICIPATING PHARMACIES.\n\n    (a) Agreements to Participate.--Any qualified pharmacy may enter \ninto an agreement with the Secretary that enables the pharmacy to sell \ncovered outpatient drugs to holders of Medicare drug benefit cards at a \nreduced price, by authorizing the pharmacy to operate as a \nparticipating pharmacy under this Act.\n    (b) Right of Participating Pharmacies To Obtain Drugs.--An \nagreement under this section shall entitle the participating pharmacy \nto purchase any covered outpatient drug that is listed on the Federal \nSupply Schedule of the General Services Administration at the \nparticipating pharmacy discount price for that drug determined under \nsubsection (d).\n    (c) Quantity of Drugs Purchased.--An agreement under this section \nshall permit the participating pharmacy to purchase under this Act as \nmuch of a covered outpatient drug as is sold by the pharmacy to holders \nof Medicare drug benefit cards.\n    (d) Participating Pharmacy Discount Price.--\n            (1) In general.--The Secretary shall determine a \n        participating pharmacy discount price for each covered \n        outpatient drug.\n            (2) Determination.--The participating pharmacy discount \n        price for a covered outpatient drug shall be determined by \n        adding--\n                    (A) the price at which the drug is available to \n                Federal agencies from the Federal Supply Schedule under \n                section 8126 of title 38, United States Code; plus\n                    (B) an amount that reflects the administrative \n                costs incurred by the Secretary in administering this \n                Act.\n\nSEC. 5.

    "reference": "Biennial Appropriations Act  This bill amends the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to change the annual appropriations process to a biennial process for nondefense spending. Congress must consider the defense appropriations bill annually and the remaining appropriations bills in either odd-numbered or even-numbered years. In each year that the appropriations bill for an agency is not considered, Congress must conduct oversight hearings. The bill requires the congressional budget resolution to be accompanied by committee allocations for biennial appropriations and the President's budget to include details that reflect the biennial process.  It also creates a point of order against considering: (1) legislation authorizing appropriations for less than two years unless the program requires no further appropriations and will be completed after appropriations are expended, and (2) authorization or revenue legislation until Congress completes action on the budget resolution, appropriations bills, and reconciliation bills.  The Office of Management and Budget must report to Congress on the impact and feasibility of a biennial budget process. "

    "input": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis \nResearch, Cure, and Care Act of 2011''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis are autoimmune, \n        chronic, inflammatory, painful, and disabling diseases that \n        require lifelong timely and appropriate medical intervention \n        and care and have no cure.\n            (2) Current studies indicate that the prevalence of \n        psoriasis in the United States ranges between two and three \n        percent, affecting approximately 7.5 million men, women, and \n        children of all ages, approximately 17,000 individuals in each \n        congressional district, and has an adverse impact on the \n        quality of life for virtually all affected.\n            (3) Psoriasis often is overlooked or dismissed because it \n        is not typically a direct cause of death. Psoriasis is commonly \n        and incorrectly considered by insurers, employers, \n        policymakers, and the public as a mere annoyance--a superficial \n        problem, mistakenly thought to be contagious, due to poor \n        hygiene, or both. As such, treatment for psoriasis is often \n        incorrectly categorized as ``cosmetic'' and not ``medically \n        necessary''.\n            (4) Psoriasis is connected with an elevated risk for other \n        serious, chronic, and life-threatening comorbid conditions, \n        including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer. \n        A higher prevalence of stroke, atherosclerosis, chronic \n        obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), Crohn's disease, \n        lymphoma, metabolic syndrome, and liver disease are also found \n        in people with psoriasis as compared to the general population. \n        Up to 30 percent of people with psoriasis also develop \n        potentially disabling psoriatic arthritis.\n            (5) The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) funded a \n        study that found that psoriasis may cause as much physical and \n        mental disability as other major chronic diseases, including \n        cancer, arthritis, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and \n        depression.\n            (6) Psoriasis is associated with elevated rates of \n        depression, anxiety, and suicidality (suicidal thoughts, \n        suicide attempts, and completed suicides). Individuals with \n        psoriasis are twice as likely to have thoughts of suicide as \n        people without psoriasis or with other chronic conditions.\n            (7) The risk of premature death is 50 percent higher for \n        people with severe psoriasis. This translates to people with \n        severe psoriasis dying four years earlier, on average, than \n        people without psoriasis.\n            (8) The economic consequences of psoriasis, both for \n        individuals and the health care system, are significant. Total \n        direct and indirect health care costs of psoriasis are \n        calculated at $11,250,000,000 with work loss accounting for 40 \n        percent of the cost burden. People with psoriasis have \n        significantly higher health care resource utilization and costs \n        than the general population. Additionally, psoriasis patients \n        with comorbidities are more likely to experience urgent care, \n        have greater rates of hospitalization, more frequent outpatient \n        visits, and incur greater costs than psoriasis patients without \n        comorbidities.\n            (9) Early diagnosis and treatment of psoriatic arthritis \n        may help prevent irreversible joint damage.\n            (10) Treating psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis presents a \n        challenge for patients and their health care providers. A wide \n        range of treatment options is available; however, adverse side \n        effects and success varies from patient to patient. The same \n        treatments do not work for every patient and a treatment that \n        may have been effective for a period of time can stop working.\n            (11) Despite a number of recent breakthroughs that have led \n        to some new treatments, too many people with psoriasis and \n        psoriatic arthritis still cannot live normal lives. For many of \n        these individuals, existing treatments are not effective or \n        appropriate or may not be accessible due to cost and insurance \n        barriers.\n            (12) Psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis constitute a \n        significant national health issue that deserves a comprehensive \n        and coordinated response by States and the Federal Government \n        with involvement of the health care provider, patient, and \n        public health communities.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Medicare home health benefit is vulnerable to \n        agency selection of the most profitable beneficiaries and \n        avoidance of the most complex and costly beneficiaries.\n            (2) Such ``cherry picking'' by some home health agencies \n        compromises access to care for the most complex, highest risk \n        beneficiaries.\n            (3) The Government Accountability Office has reported that \n        hospital discharge planners have difficulty placing more than \n        10 percent of eligible patients in home health due to their \n        extensive care needs.\n            (4) Proposals to reduce Medicare payments to home health \n        agencies (in response to large aggregate margins across all \n        home health agencies) may undermine the financial viability of \n        mission-driven and non-profit home health agencies, which often \n        have low to negative margins, while allowing high-margin \n        agencies to remain in operation.\n\nSEC. 3.

    "input": "SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Microbicide Development Act''.\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Women and girls are the new face of HIV/AIDS, and are \n        increasingly affected by the disease in every region of the \n        world. As of 2006, nearly half of the 37,200,000 adults living \n        with HIV and AIDS worldwide were women. In sub-Saharan Africa, \n        that proportion was 59 percent.\n            (2) Because of their social and biological vulnerabilities, \n        young women are particularly at risk of HIV infection. In sub-\n        Saharan Africa, the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is three times \n        higher among women ages 15 to 24 than it is among men in that \n        same age group.\n            (3) Women infected with HIV can transmit the infection to \n        their infants during pregnancy, labor, delivery, or breast-\n        feeding. The most effective way to interrupt mother-to-child \n        transmission is to ensure that mothers are not infected in the \n        first place.\n            (4) Many women who become infected with HIV have just one \n        sexual partner--their husband. Marriage is not necessarily \n        effective protection against HIV, because to protect themselves \n        from HIV, women have to rely on their male partners to be \n        faithful or to use condoms. Many women, especially in the \n        developing world, are unable to insist on mutual monogamy or \n        negotiate condom use, particularly in long-term relationships.\n            (5) Scientists are working on a promising new prevention \n        tool that could slow down the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic--\n        microbicides. Formulated as gels, creams, tablets or rings, \n        microbicides are being designed to stop the transmission of the \n        pathogens that cause AIDS and other sexually transmitted \n        infections (referred to in this section as ``STIs''). \n        Microbicides could allow a woman to protect herself from \n        disease.\n            (6) Couples need a method of HIV protection that will allow \n        them to conceive a child and start a family. No existing HIV \n        prevention method also allows conception. Some microbicides in \n        development may allow women to become pregnant while at the \n        same time protecting them from infection.\n            (7) According to UNICEF, worldwide, the lack of HIV/AIDS \n        prevention and treatment has left over 15,000,000 children as \n        orphans. Of these, more than 12,000,000 live in sub-Saharan \n        Africa. The number of AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa alone \n        is expected to grow to nearly 16,000,000 by 2010.\n            (8) HIV prevention tools like microbicides could also be \n        valuable for women in the United States, who account for an \n        increasing proportion of new HIV and AIDS cases among \n        Americans. Minority women in the United States are particularly \n        affected. Both African-American and Latina women account for a \n        disproportionate number of new AIDS cases, and HIV/AIDS was the \n        leading cause of death in 2002 for African-American women ages \n        25 to 34.\n            (9) With nearly 20,000,000 new cases of sexually \n        transmitted infections occurring every year, the United States \n        has the highest STI rates of any industrialized nation. Like \n        HIV, STIs pose significant health threats and costs, with young \n        people and women bearing a disproportionate burden. Nearly half \n        of new STI cases each year occur in people under 25 years of \n        age with women both more vulnerable to infection and more \n        likely to experience serious and lasting health consequences \n        when they do become infected. Some microbicides could help \n        prevent STIs.\n            (10) HIV/AIDS threatens national and global security. \n        Beyond its burdens on individuals, families, and communities, \n        the pandemic reduces economic growth, decimates health budgets, \n        undermines civil society, and burdens the armed forces of many \n        nations, including the United States military.\n            (11) The microbicide field has gained considerable \n        scientific momentum. Several first-generation products are in \n        large-scale human trials to measure effectiveness, and new \n        products based on recent advances in HIV treatment are well \n        into safety trials.\n            (12) Microbicides are a public health good with potential \n        for large social benefits but limited economic incentives for \n        private investment, so that public funding is required to fill \n        the gap. As is the case for vaccines and other public goods, \n        microbicide development must depend heavily on government \n        leadership and investment.\n            (13) The Federal Government needs to make a strong \n        commitment to microbicide research and development. Three \n        agencies, the National Institutes of Health, Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention, and United States Agency for \n        International Development, have played important roles in the \n        progress to date, and each makes a valuable and unique \n        contribution. As the primary Federal agency for conducting and \n        supporting medical research and the largest single Federal \n        Government contributor to microbicide research, the National \n        Institutes of Health supports the Microbicide Trials Network as \n        well as other important research activities. The United States \n        Agency for International Development sustains strong \n        partnerships with public and private organizations working on \n        microbicide research, including trials in developing countries \n        where its experience is extensive, and is well positioned to \n        facilitate introduction of microbicides once available. The \n        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a long history \n        of conducting field trials in developing countries, but the \n        extent of its current engagement remains quite limited.\n            (14) According to the National Institutes of Health's \n        strategic plan, microbicides may provide ``one of the most \n        promising primary preventative interventions that could be \n        safe, effective, readily available, affordable, and widely \n        acceptable''. In a recent report to Congress, the United States \n        Agency for International Development states that ``the US \n        government is firmly committed to accelerating the development \n        of safe and effective microbicides to prevent HIV''. In \n        addition, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief \n        recognizes the urgency of developing safe and effective \n        microbicides.\n            (15) The National Institutes of Health, United States \n        Agency for International Development, and the Centers for \n        Disease Control and Prevention have expanded their microbicide \n        portfolios, but overall Federal leadership and coordination is \n        required to eliminate costly inefficiencies and unproductive \n        duplication of effort.\n            (16) HIV prevention options available as of 2006 are \n        insufficient in general. Most critically, they fail to \n        recognize women's particular needs and vulnerabilities. If \n        women are to have a genuine opportunity to protect themselves, \n        their best option is the rapid development of new HIV-\n        prevention technologies like microbicides, which women can \n        initiate.\n\n   TITLE I--MICROBICIDE RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\nSEC. 101.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) it is in the interest of the United States to maintain \n        healthy livestock herds;\n            (2) managing the risks of foot and mouth disease, bovine \n        spongiform encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United \n        States may require billions of dollars for remedial activities \n        by consumers, producers, and distributors of meat and blood \n        products;\n            (3) the potential introduction of those diseases into the \n        United States would cause devastating financial losses to--\n                    (A) the agriculture industry and other economic \n                sectors; and\n                    (B) United States trade in the affected animals and \n                animal products;\n            (4) foot and mouth disease is a severe and highly \n        contagious viral infection affecting cattle, deer, goats, \n        sheep, swine, and other animals;\n            (5) the most effective means of eradicating foot and mouth \n        disease is by the slaughter of affected animals;\n            (6) while foot and mouth disease was eradicated in the \n        United States in 1929, the virus could be reintroduced by--\n                    (A) a single infected animal, an animal product, or \n                a person carrying the virus;\n                    (B) an act of terrorism; or\n                    (C) other means;\n            (7) once introduced, foot and mouth disease can spread \n        quickly through--\n                    (A) exposure to aerosols from infected animals;\n                    (B) direct contact with infected animals; and\n                    (C) contact with contaminated feed, equipment, or \n                humans harboring the virus or carrying the virus on \n                their clothing;\n            (8) foot and mouth disease is endemic to more than \\2/3\\ of \n        the world and is considered to be widespread in parts of \n        Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America;\n            (9) foot and mouth disease occurs in over 7 different \n        serotypes and 60 subtypes;\n            (10) as foot and mouth disease outbreaks have occurred, the \n        United States has banned the importation of live ruminants and \n        swine and many animal products from countries affected by foot \n        and mouth disease;\n            (11) recently, the United States has implemented bans in \n        response to outbreaks in Argentina, the European Union, and \n        Taiwan;\n            (12) although United States exclusion programs have been \n        successful at keeping foot and mouth disease out of the United \n        States since 1929, recent outbreaks in Argentina, the European \n        Union, and Taiwan are placing an unprecedented strain on our \n        animal health system;\n            (13) bovine spongiform encephalopathy is a transmissible, \n        neuro-degenerative disease found in cattle;\n            (14) in cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, the \n        active agent is found primarily in the brain and spinal cord \n        and has not been found in commonly consumed beef products;\n            (15) bovine spongiform encephalopathy is thought to have an \n        incubation period of several years but is ultimately fatal to \n        cattle within weeks of onset of the active disease;\n            (16) bovine spongiform encephalopathy was first widely \n        found in 1986 in cattle in the United Kingdom;\n            (17) bovine spongiform encephalopathy-carrying cattle have \n        been found in cattle in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, \n        Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, \n        Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland;\n            (18) cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy \n        originating from the United Kingdom have been found and \n        intercepted in Canada;\n            (19) since 1989, the Secretary of Agriculture has \n        prohibited the importation of live grazing animals from \n        countries where bovine spongiform encephalopathy has been found \n        in cattle;\n            (20) other products derived from grazing animals, such as \n        blood meal, bonemeal, fat, fetal bovine serum, glands, meat-\n        and-bone meal, and offal, are prohibited from entry, except \n        under special conditions or under permits issued by the \n        Secretary of Agriculture for scientific or research purposes;\n            (21) on December 12, 1997, the Secretary of Agriculture \n        extended those restrictions to include all countries in Europe \n        because of concerns about widespread risk factors and \n        inadequate surveillance for bovine spongiform encephalopathy;\n            (22) on December 7, 2000, the Secretary of Agriculture \n        prohibited all imports of rendered animal protein products from \n        Europe;\n            (23) Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease is a human spongiform \n        encephalopathy;\n            (24) on March 20, 1996, the Spongiform Encephalopathy \n        Advisory Committee of the United Kingdom announced the \n        identification of 10 cases of a new variant of Creutzfeldt-\n        Jacob disease;\n            (25) all 10 patients developed onsets of the disease in \n        1994 or 1995;\n            (26) scientific experts (including scientists at the \n        Department of Agriculture, the Department of Health and Human \n        Services, and the World Health Organization) are studying the \n        possible link (including potential routes of transmission) \n        between bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant \n        Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease;\n            (27) from October 1996 to December 2000, 87 cases of \n        variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease have been reported in the \n        United Kingdom, 3 cases in France, and 1 case in Ireland; and\n            (28) to reduce the risk of human spongiform \n        encephalopathies in the United States, the Commissioner of Food \n        and Drugs has--\n                    (A) banned individuals who lived in Great Britain \n                for at least 180 days since 1980 from donating blood in \n                the United States; and\n                    (B) established regulations that prohibit the \n                feeding of most animal-derived proteins to grazing \n                animals.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide the people of \nthe United States and Congress with information concerning--\n            (1) actions by Federal agencies to prevent foot and mouth \n        disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, and related \n        diseases;\n            (2) the sufficiency of legislative authority to prevent or \n        control foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform \n        encephalopathy, and related diseases in the United States;\n            (3) the economic impacts associated with the potential \n        introduction of foot and mouth disease, bovine spongiform \n        encephalopathy, and related diseases into the United States; \n        and\n            (4) the risks to public health from possible links between \n        bovine spongiform encephalopathy and other spongiform \n        encephalopathies to human illnesses.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Student borrowing is widespread in higher education, \n        and more than $100,000,000,000 in Federal education loans are \n        originated each year. In 2008, 62 percent of recipients of a \n        baccalaureate degree graduated with student debt.\n            (2) Forty-eight percent of students at 4-year public \n        institutions of higher education borrow money to pay for \n        college, as do 57 percent of students at 4-year private \n        institutions of higher education, and 96 percent of students at \n        for-profit institutions of higher education.\n            (3) In 2008, 92 percent of Black students, 85 percent of \n        Hispanic students, 85 percent of American Indian/Alaska Native \n        students, 82 percent of multi-racial students, 80 percent of \n        Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander students, 77 percent of White \n        students, and 68 percent of Asian students received financial \n        aid.\n            (4) Students depart from institutions of higher education \n        with significant debt. In 2008, the average student loan debt \n        among graduates of institutions of higher education was \n        $23,186, and 1 in 10 recipients of a baccalaureate degree \n        graduated with at least $40,000 in debt. In 2008, 57 percent of \n        recipients of a baccalaureate degree from a for-profit \n        institution of higher education owed more than $30,000, and the \n        median amount of debt was $32,700. Since 2003, the average \n        cumulative debt among students at institutions of higher \n        education has increased by 5.6 percent each year.\n            (5) Students enrolled in for-profit institutions of higher \n        education account for 47 percent of all student loan defaults, \n        despite representing approximately 10 percent of all students \n        enrolled in institutions of higher education. Since 2003, the \n        national cohort default rate has increased from 4.5 percent to \n        7 percent.\n            (6) Students rely on access to credit. Fifty-six percent of \n        dependent students at institutions of higher education had a \n        credit card in their own name in 2004. The average credit card \n        balance among such students who were carrying a balance on \n        their cards was $2,000.\n            (7) According to the National Foundation for Credit \n        Counseling, the majority of adults (56 percent of adults in the \n        United States, or 127,000,000 people) do not have a budget or \n        keep close track of expenses or spending.\n            (8) According to a 2009 National Bankruptcy Research Center \n        study, consumers who received financial education through pre-\n        bankruptcy counseling had 27.5 percent fewer delinquent \n        accounts and remained current on their accounts for 29 percent \n        longer than consumers who did not receive such counseling.\n            (9) According to the Financial Industry Regulatory \n        Authority Investor Education Foundation, less than \\1/3\\ of \n        young adults (ages 18 to 29) set aside emergency savings to \n        weather unexpected financial challenges.\n            (10) According to a Jump$tart Coalition for Personal \n        Financial Literacy survey, 62 percent of high school students \n        cannot pass a basic personal finance exam, and financial \n        literacy scores among future higher education students are low.\n            (11) According to research by the National Endowment for \n        Financial Education and the University of Arizona, schools are \n        the institutions that students trust most to help increase \n        their knowledge of personal finance.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) by the year 2050, the world will need to supply between \n        2 and 3 times as much energy as is presently produced to meet \n        minimum requirements for food, shelter, transportation, and \n        economic security;\n            (2) meeting the increased energy demands of the year 2050 \n        cannot be achieved without substantial environmental \n        degradation unless there is a massive shift from dependence on \n        the fossil fuels which today provide more than three-quarters \n        of all energy supply;\n            (3) a wide variety of nonfossil fuel energy technologies \n        must be developed to meet the expected demand of the year 2050;\n            (4) the Federal Government has a responsibility to fund \n        research in energy technologies to help meet future expected \n        energy demand where the technical or economic risks of \n        developing such technologies are too high to be borne solely by \n        the private sector;\n            (5) despite the urgent need to develop a wide variety of \n        nonfossil fuel energy technologies, the Federal Government's \n        investment in all energy supply research and development \n        (including fossil fuels) has declined in real terms by more \n        than two-thirds in the last 14 years;\n            (6) fusion energy is one of the nonfossil fuel technologies \n        which could potentially provide safe, abundant, environmentally \n        sound, secure, and affordable energy supplies in the future;\n            (7) in the last 16 years, fusion energy researchers have \n        made significant progress toward realizing magnetic fusion as a \n        viable source of energy, increasing power production from test \n        reactors more than a million-fold over that time period;\n            (8) while significant engineering, technical, and \n        scientific challenges remain to make fusion energy commercially \n        viable, limited funding remains the primary constraint to more \n        rapid progress;\n            (9) the technical risks and the long time scale needed to \n        demonstrate the commercial viability of fusion energy will \n        likely require a stable, predictable, and sustained investment \n        of government funding for decades to come;\n            (10) while magnetic fusion is the leading fusion \n        technology, research on alternative fusion concepts should \n        continue to be supported;\n            (11) opportunities to participate in international fusion \n        experiments can dramatically lower the cost to the Federal \n        Government of fusion energy research;\n            (12) the United States must demonstrate that it is a \n        credible partner in international scientific programs by being \n        able to make and keep long-term commitments to funding and \n        participation; and\n            (13) the United States should commit to participating in \n        the siting, construction, and operation of ITER as soon as \n        practicable.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Clause 3 of section 8 of article I of the United States \n        Constitution recognizes the special relationship between the \n        United States and Indian tribes.\n            (2) Beginning in 1970, with the inauguration by the Nixon \n        Administration of the Indian self-determination era, each \n        successive President has reaffirmed the special government-to-\n        government relationship between Indian tribes and the United \n        States.\n            (3) In 1994, President Clinton issued an executive \n        memorandum to the heads of all Federal departments and agencies \n        that obligated all such departments and agencies, particularly \n        those that have an impact on economic development, to evaluate \n        the potential impacts of their actions on Indian tribes.\n            (4) The United States has an obligation to guard and \n        preserve the agricultural and related renewable resources of \n        Indian tribes in order to foster strong tribal governments, \n        Indian self-determination, and economic self-sufficiency among \n        Indian tribes.\n            (5) Despite the availability of abundant natural resources \n        on Indian lands and a rich cultural legacy that accords great \n        value to self-determination, self-reliance, and independence, \n        Native Americans suffer higher rates of unemployment, poverty, \n        poor health, substandard housing, and associated social ills \n        than those of any other group in the United States.\n            (6) Reservation-based Indians tend to be the most rural of \n        any minority group. They tend to be geographically isolated, \n        resource limited, and the least likely of any farm group to \n        receive payment or loans from the United States.\n            (7) Indian land represents close to 55,000,000 acres, or \n        about 2 percent of the United States land base, with nearly \n        47,000,000 of these acres consisting of range and cropland.\n            (8) Indian agriculture constitutes the second largest \n        revenue generator and employer in Indian country and is not \n        limited to farming and ranching, but often includes such \n        products as forestry, bison, wild rice and fruits, cotton, \n        tobacco and other Native-made or grown products.\n            (9) Because of the lack of Federal intra-agency and inter-\n        agency coordination in agriculture programs and policies, the \n        development of Indian agriculture and related tribal business \n        and economic development potential has been hindered.\n            (10) It is estimated that about 20 percent of reservation \n        grazing land and about 70 percent of cropland is leased to non-\n        Indian producers.\n            (11) American Indians today use their lands and natural \n        resources for agriculture and agribusiness to provide food and \n        other staples for consumption, improving their economic self-\n        sufficiency, agriculture income and reservation employment.\n            (12) Although there are many programs within Department of \n        Agriculture for which tribal and individual Indian producers \n        are eligible, Indian producers have not fully benefited from \n        these programs because of insufficient coordination within the \n        Department of Agriculture.\n            (13) The United States has an obligation to assist Indian \n        tribes with the creation of appropriate economic and political \n        conditions with respect to Indian lands to--\n                    (A) encourage investment from outside sources that \n                do not originate with the tribes; and\n                    (B) facilitate economic ventures with outside \n                entities that are not tribal entities.\n            (14) The economic success and material well-being of Native \n        American communities depends on the combined efforts of the \nFederal Government, tribal governments, the private sector, and \nindividuals.\n    (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n            (1) promote the coordination of existing agricultural and \n        related programs within the Department of Agriculture to \n        provide the maximum benefit to Indian tribes and their members;\n            (2) encourage intertribal, regional, and international \n        trade and business development in order to assist in increasing \n        productivity and the standard of living of members of Indian \n        tribes and improving the economic self-sufficiency of the \n        Indian tribes;\n            (3) through improving the administration of Federal \n        program, improve the access of Indian tribes to capital, \n        specialty markets, export promotions, and marketing assistance \n        that non-Indian agriculture producers currently have access to;\n            (4) improve the development and coordination of Indian \n        agriculture and related value-added industries to promote self-\n        sustaining Native economies and communities; and\n            (5) promote economic self-sufficiency and political self-\n        determination for Indian tribes and members of Indian tribes.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Men and women who serve in the Armed Forces make great \n        sacrifices for the Nation and for freedom.\n            (2) The Nation takes great pride in the integrity of \n        members of the Armed Forces and places full faith and \n        confidence in these men and women serving in the Armed Forces.\n            (3) The Nation should extend such full faith to the \n        integrity of those men and women when they make claims for \n        disability compensation related to their service.\n            (4) In the spirit of the Armed Forces' pledge never to \n        leave a man behind, the Nation should never leave a veteran \n        behind.\n            (5) Military service is inherently dangerous and stressful \n        whether during peacetime or during war.\n            (6) Post-traumatic stress disorder (referred to in this \n        section as ``PTSD'') is a debilitating mental health condition \n        linked to military service that the Secretary of Veterans \n        Affairs should make every effort to diagnose and effectively \n        treat.\n            (7) It is recognized in the medical community that PTSD can \n        onset at anytime after a traumatic event, and the course of the \n        disorder can contain periods of both relapse and remission.\n            (8) Denial by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of claims \n        for disability compensation for PTSD due to incomplete military \n        records does a disservice to those who have honorably served \n        the country.\n            (9) Military records that would validate such claims may \n        have been lost due to no fault of the veteran.\n            (10) Due to the dangerous and fast-paced environment in \n        which the members of the Armed Forces operate, not every \n        significant and possibly traumatic incident in the life and \n        service of each member is chronicled accurately or completely.\n            (11) Evaluations for disability compensation for PTSD often \n        place veterans under the additional hardship of reliving \n        traumatic events by describing them to unfamiliar medical \n        professionals.\n            (12) According to the Institute of Medicine and \n        representatives of certain veterans' service organizations, \n        evaluations for pension and disability compensation for PTSD \n        are sometimes completed in as little as 20 minutes, despite \n        recommendations of the mental health community that evaluations \n        should take place over a period of one hour or more.\n            (13) The Veterans' Disability Benefits Commission, \n        established pursuant to title XV of the National Defense \n        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004, issued recommendations \n        to improve the care, compensation, and treatment of veterans \n        diagnosed with PTSD, including updating the schedule for rating \n        disabilities under section 1155 of title 38, United States \n        Code, establishing new criteria for the diagnosis and treatment \n        of PTSD, and using a holistic approach to treat veterans with \n        PTSD that incorporates treatment, compensation, and vocational \n        assessment.\n\nSEC. 3. STANDARD OF PROOF FOR SERVICE-CONNECTION OF POST-TRAUMATIC \n              STRESS DISORDER.\n\n    (a) Standard of Proof.--Section 1154 of title 38, United States \nCode, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n    ``(c) The Secretary shall accept as sufficient proof of service-\nconnection of post-traumatic stress disorder alleged to have been \nincurred in or aggravated by service in the active military, naval, or \nair service a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder by a mental \nhealth professional together with a written determination by the \nprofessional that such disorder is related to the veteran's service, if \nconsistent with the circumstances, conditions, or hardships of such \nservice, notwithstanding the fact that there is no official record of \nsuch incurrence or aggravation in such service, and, to that end, shall \nresolve every reasonable doubt in favor of the veteran. Service-\nconnection of post-traumatic stress disorder may be rebutted by clear \nand convincing evidence to the contrary. In the case of such a \nrebuttal, the Secretary shall make all documents related to the \nservice-connection of the veteran's disability available to the \nveteran.''.\n    (b) Applicability.--Subsection (c) of section 1154 of title 38, \nUnited States Code, shall apply with respect to any claim for \ndisability compensation under laws administered by the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs for which no final decision has been made before the \ndate of the enactment of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.

    "reference": "Freedom from Equifax Exploitation Act This bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to revise fraud alert provisions required of consumer reporting agencies. A fraud alert must be placed in a consumer's file upon request if the consumer suspects harm from an unauthorized disclosure. The time period for fraud alerts is extended from 90 days to 1 year. The bill also revises provisions relating to 7-year renewable fraud alerts in cases of identity theft.  The bill establishes a credit freeze process. A consumer reporting agency must place a free credit freeze on the consumer's file upon a consumer's request, prohibiting a consumer reporting agency from releasing any credit information without the consumer's permission. Consumer reporting agencies must provide procedures for temporarily and permanently lifting the freeze at no charge to the consumer. Consumers are allowed a free credit report when requesting a credit freeze. While the file is subject to a freeze, a consumer reporting agency is prohibited from including the consumer in lists provided to third parties for credit or insurance offers. A consumer reporting agency must provide on the Internet policies and procedures for consumers to: (1) place, temporarily lift, or fully remove a credit freeze; and (2) make required statements for fraud alerts or credit freezes.  The bill requires consumer reporting agencies to issue a refund of fees to any consumer who requested a credit freeze beginning September 7, 2017, through the day before enactment of this bill. "

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Allegations have been raised of substantial fraud and \n        corruption in the administration of the Office of the Iraq Oil-\n        for-Food Program of the United Nations.\n            (2) The United Nations received 2.2 percent of the proceeds \n        of the sale of the oil exported from Iraq under the oil-for-\n        food program, representing approximately $1,400,000,000, to \n        fund the administrative costs of the program.\n            (3) The General Accounting Office estimates that during the \n        period from 1997 through 2002, the former Iraqi regime received \n        $10,100,000,000 in illegal revenues from the oil-for-food \n        program, including $5,700,000,000 received from oil smuggled \n        out of Iraq and $4,400,000,000 received from surcharges on oil \n        sales and illicit commissions from suppliers exporting goods to \n        Iraq.\n            (4) Any illicit activity by United Nations officials, \n        personnel, agents, or contractors, including entities that have \n        entered into contracts under the oil-for-food program, is \n        unacceptable and should be thoroughly investigated.\n            (5) Documents in the files of the former Oil Ministry of \n        Iraq indicate that Benon Sevan, the Executive Director of the \n        oil-for-food program, and other senior United Nations officials \n        may have been connected to an illicit scheme in which \n        approximately 270 prominent foreign officials, business people, \n        and political entities received the right to trade in Iraqi oil \n        at below-market prices.\n            (6) On April 21, 2004, the United Nations Security Council \n        adopted Resolution 1538, which established a high-level inquiry \n        into allegations regarding the administration of the oil-for-\n        food program. The inquiry will be led by Paul Volcker, but the \n        investigators will not have subpoena power.\n            (7) The ability and credibility of the United Nations \n        Security Council to act in matters of war and peace is \n        threatened by the alleged influence of politically connected \n        individuals, companies, and institutions of the permanent \n        member states who received Iraqi oil contracts.\n            (8) The ability and credibility of the United Nations to \n        convey legitimacy to the new Government of Iraq and assist in \n        the reconstruction of postwar Iraq is hampered by these \n        allegations of United Nations corruption and mismanagement in \n        the oil-for-food program.\n\nSEC. 3. OIL-FOR-FOOD PROGRAM DEFINED.\n\n    In this Act, the term ``oil-for-food program'' means the program \nestablished and administered pursuant to United Nations Security \nCouncil Resolution 986 (April 14, 1995) and subsequent United Nations \nresolutions to permit the sale of petroleum products exported from Iraq \nand to use the revenue generated from such sale for humanitarian \nassistance.\n\nSEC. 4.

Over the medium and \n        long terms, this will start to affect the overall quality of \n        the strategic partnership between the United States and Poland.\n            (2) Poland has actively participated in the global campaign \n        against terrorism led by the United States.

Polish citizens have not been involved in any \n        form of terrorist activities on the territory of the United \n        States or against the interests of the United States overseas.\n            (3) Since joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on \n        March 12, 1999, Poland has proven to be a reliable partner and \n        a capable guarantor of NATO security in Kosovo and Afghanistan.\n            (4) From the first days of Operation Iraqi Freedom, Poland \n        has been a staunch ally to the United States and has committed \n        its soldiers to help with ongoing stabilization efforts in \n        Iraq.\n            (5) In recognition of the historic changes in our bilateral \n        relations and motivated by the sincere need to enhance contacts \n        between Polish and United States citizens, on April 15, 1991, \n        Poland unilaterally repealed its visa obligation for United \n        States citizens seeking to travel to Poland for a period of 90 \n        days or less.\n            (6) The Polish-American community of 9.3 million people \n        contributed significantly to the development of the United \n        States.\n            (7) Since the movement known as ``Solidarity'' and the \n        turning point of 1989, Poland has undergone great political, \n        social, and economic changes. It has become a nation committed \n        to traditional values, rules of law, freedom, and democracy.\n            (8) On May 1, 2004, Poland became a member state of the \n        vibrant European Union. Poland is a free market economy, and \n        Poland's integration within the European structures has had a \n        stabilizing effect on its economy.\n            (9) More than 150,000 Polish citizens visited the United \n        States in 2003.\n            (10) Poland's visa refusal rate has declined dramatically, \n        and it continues to decline. Nevertheless, the visa refusal \n        rate is an arbitrary standard that is not an objective \n        measurement because it does not reflect the propensity of \n        nationals from Poland to violate the terms of their admission \n        into the United States.\n            (11) Poland participates in the work and travel program \n        that allows about 25,000 Polish students to visit the United \n        States each year.\n            (12) Warsaw International Airport Okecie participates in \n        the pilot program of voluntary passenger screening for \n        passengers leaving Warsaw to fly to the United States.\n            (13) If Poland is allowed to conditionally participate in \n        the visa waiver program, the Polish government will develop and \n        implement a campaign to prevent Polish citizens from remaining \n        in the United States beyond their authorized period of \n        admission or otherwise violating the terms of their admission \n        into the United States.\n            (14) The Polish government is committed to becoming a \n        successful part of the visa waiver program.\n            (15) Poland is ready to demonstrate that adequate \n        safeguards against fraudulent use of its passports are in \n        place, including proper storage of blank passports and \n        sufficient screening of passport applicants.\n            (16) Poland is determined to fulfill its obligations and \n        introduce extremely safe passports for its citizens, including \n        two mandatory biometric identifiers. This is in addition to \n        satisfaction of the machine-readable requirements for passports \n        described in the Immigration and Nationality Act.\n            (17) On February 23, 2004, and May 11, 2004, the assemblies \n        of New Jersey and Massachusetts, respectively, enacted \n        resolutions urging the President and the Congress to make \n        Poland eligible for the visa waiver program.\n\nSEC. 2. TEMPORARY AND CONDITIONAL DESIGNATIONS OF POLAND FOR VISA \n              WAIVER PROGRAM.\n\n    (a) Temporary Designation.--\n            (1) In general.--Effective on the date of the enactment of \n        this Act, and notwithstanding section 217(c) of the Immigration \n        and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1187(c)), Poland temporarily \n        shall be designated a program country for purposes of the visa \n        waiver program established under section 217 of such Act.\n            (2) Expiration.--The temporary designation described in \n        paragraph (1) shall expire on the date that is 18 months after \n        the date of the enactment of this Act.\n    (b) Review.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment \nof this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall determine the \noverstay rate for the portion of the period of temporary designation \ndescribed in subsection (a) that has elapsed when the determination is \nmade. Based on such calculation, the Secretary shall determine whether \nPoland permanently, but conditionally, shall be designated a program \ncountry for purposes of such visa waiver program.\n    (c) Duration, Suspension, and Termination of Conditional \nDesignation.--\n            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n        law, if the Secretary determines under subsection (b) that \n        Poland permanently, but conditionally, shall be designated a \n        program country, Poland shall continue to be a program country \n        for purposes of the visa waiver program as long as the annual \n        overstay rate for each fiscal year remains below 3 percent.\n            (2) Suspension.--If the overstay rate for a fiscal year \n        exceeds 3 percent, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall \n        suspend the designation of Poland as a program country for \n        purposes of the visa waiver program for a period of 1 year.\n            (3) Termination.--If the annual overstay rate exceeds 3 \n        percent for any two fiscal years (regardless of whether such \n        years are consecutive), the Secretary of Homeland Security \n        shall terminate the designation of Poland as a program country \n        for purposes of the visa waiver program.\n            (4) Redesignation.--The Secretary of Homeland Security may \n        redesignate Poland as a program country without regard to any \n        other law when the Secretary determines that Poland has \n        established satisfactory new safeguards to ensure that the \n        overstay rate will remain acceptably low.\n    (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``overstay \nrate'' means the percentage which--\n            (1) the total number of nationals of Poland who were \n        admitted as nonimmigrant visitors during the applicable \n        measurement period and who violated the terms of such \n        admission; bears to\n            (2) the total number of nationals of such country who \n        applied for admission as nonimmigrant visitors during such \n        period.",

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n            (1) there is approximately $1,100,000,000,000 of \n        outstanding student loan debt in the United States, including \n        more than $150,000,000,000 in private education loans;\n            (2) as of 2008, 81 percent of individuals graduating with \n        an undergraduate degree with more than $40,000 in student loans \n        had a private education loan;\n            (3) the limited number of lenders in the private education \n        loan marketplace reduce the ability of borrowers with private \n        education loans to restructure, refinance, or negotiate \n        repayment terms for their current loans, leading to excessive \n        debt burdens and potential default; and\n            (4) excessive student indebtedness reduces economic \n        activity, threatens homeownership, hurts small business growth, \n        and limits opportunities for economic expansion in rural \n        communities.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to spur economic growth, \nby establishing a mechanism to allow borrowers of private education \nloans to refinance their loans in order--\n            (1) to facilitate greater competition in the private \n        education lending and refinancing markets;\n            (2) to address inefficiencies in the private education \n        lending and refinancing markets;\n            (3) to encourage innovation in the private education \n        refinancing markets; and\n            (4) to promote the participation of private capital in the \n        private education refinancing markets.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act--\n            (1) the term ``private education loan'' has the same \n        meaning as in section 140(a) of the Truth in Lending Act (15 \n        U.S.C. 1650(a)); and\n            (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n        Treasury, other than in the context of the Secretary of \n        Education.\n\nSEC. 4.

and\n            (5) how the use of the methodology and factors, as proposed \n        in the notice, will be used to ensure that any exercise of \n        authority by the Secretary will result in no net cost to the \n        Federal Government.\n    (c) Initial Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \nenactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress a report that includes--\n            (1) a plan of the Secretary to implement credit mechanisms \n        under the authority of this Act;\n            (2) a description of macroeconomic benefits of increased \n        efficiency and refinance activity in the student loan market;

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n    It is the sense of Congress that the Federal financial \ninstitutions, such as the Federal Financing Bank and the Federal \nReserve banks, and federally chartered private entities, such as the \nFederal home loan banks, should consider, in consultation with the \nSecretary and the Secretary of Education, using available authorities \nin a timely manner, if needed, to assist in ensuring that borrowers of \nprivate education loans can secure credit accommodations to refinance \nexisting loans, in a manner that results in no increased costs to \ntaxpayers.",

    "reference": "Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act of 2016 This bill directs the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to promulgate regulations to update the standards for lead-contaminated dust and lead-contaminated soil, in accordance with health-based standards. The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 is amended to define elevated blood lead level as the lower of:  5 mg/dL (micrograms of lead per deciliter), or the most recent definition for elevated blood lead level or reference range level in children ages 1 through 5 set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The bill also removes 0-bedroom housing from the definition of target housing. The Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act is amended to direct HUD to promulgate regulations that:  require an initial lead-based paint hazard risk assessment before a family with a child under age six occupies certain housing, unless lead-based paint has already been removed; and  state that a visual assessment is not sufficient for these purposes.  These regulations shall apply to housing receiving federal assistance that was constructed before 1978, but exclude:  single-family housing covered by an application for mortgage insurance from the Federal Housing Administration, or multi-family housing covered by such an application but does not receive any other federal housing assistance.  HUD regulations shall also require emergency relocation of such families, without placement on a waitlist, penalty, or lapse in assistance, to another unit of covered housing that has no lead-based paint hazards. The Government Accountability Office shall report to Congress on lead hazards in federally assisted housing."

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Ozone precursor emissions have been reduced by over 50 \n        percent since 1980, resulting in a 33-percent improvement of \n        ozone air quality. The Environmental Protection Agency projects \n        this improvement will continue even under rules and programs \n        already in place.\n            (2) States are just beginning to implement the 2008 ozone \n        standards, for which the Environmental Protection Agency \n        published State implementation plan requirements on February \n        13, 2015. Notwithstanding this delayed implementation of the \n        2008 ozone standards, the Environmental Protection Agency \n        published the 2015 ozone standards on October 26, 2015.\n            (3) With publication of the 2015 ozone standards so early \n        in the implementation of the 2008 ozone standards, States face \n        the prospect of simultaneously implementing two national \n        ambient air quality standards for ozone.\n            (4) In addition, counties face severe statutorily imposed \n        consequences if designated as nonattainment or for failing to \n        meet attainment deadlines, even if those counties would \n        ultimately achieve attainment with no further action.\n            (5) If the 2008 and 2015 ozone standards implementation \n        schedules are not harmonized, already strained State resources \n        will be burdened by overlapping implementation schedules, and \n        counties that are projected to achieve necessary air quality \n        improvements will face significant and permanent sanctions.\n\nSEC. 3. OZONE STANDARDS IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE HARMONIZATION.\n\n    (a) Designation Submission.--Not later than October 26, 2024, the \nGovernor of each State shall designate in accordance with section \n107(d) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)) all areas (or portions \nthereof) of the Governor's State as attainment, nonattainment, or \nunclassifiable with respect to the 2015 ozone standards.\n    (b) Designation Promulgation.--Not later than October 26, 2025, the \nAdministrator shall promulgate final designations under section 107(d) \nof the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7407(d)) for all areas in all States \nwith respect to the 2015 ozone standards, including any modifications \nto the designations submitted under subsection (a).\n    (c) State Implementation Plans.--Not later than October 26, 2026, \nnotwithstanding the deadline specified in section 110(a)(1) of the \nClean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7410(d)(1)), each State shall submit the plan \nrequired by such section 110(a)(1) for the 2015 ozone standards.\n\nSEC. 4. CERTAIN PRECONSTRUCTION PERMITS.\n\n    (a) In General.--The 2015 ozone standards shall not apply to the \nreview and disposition of a preconstruction permit application if--\n            (1) the Administrator or the State, local, or tribal \n        permitting authority, as applicable, determines the application \n        to be complete on or before the date of promulgation of final \n        designations under section 3(b); or\n            (2) the Administrator or the State, local, or tribal \n        permitting authority, as applicable, publishes a public notice \n        of a preliminary determination or draft permit for the \n        application before the date that is 60 days after the date of \n        promulgation of final designations under section 3(b).\n    (b) Rules of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \nconstrued to--\n            (1) eliminate the obligation of a preconstruction permit \n        applicant to install best available control technology and \n        lowest achievable emissions rate technology, as applicable; or\n            (2) limit the authority of a State, local, or tribal \n        permitting authority to impose more stringent emissions \n        requirements pursuant to State, local, or tribal law than \n        Federal national ambient air quality standards established by \n        the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nSEC. 5. ADJUSTMENT OF 5-YEAR REVIEW CYCLE.\n\n    (a) 10-Year Cycle for All Criteria Air Pollutants.--Paragraphs (1) \nand (2)(B) of section 109(d) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7409(d)) \nare amended by striking ``five-year intervals'' each place it appears \nand inserting ``ten-year intervals''.\n    (b) Cycle for Next Review of Ozone Criteria and Standards.--\nNotwithstanding section 109(d) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. \n7409(d)), the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency \nshall not--\n            (1) complete, before October 26, 2025, any review of the \n        criteria for ozone published under section 108 of such Act (42 \n        U.S.C. 7408) or the national ambient air quality standard for \n        ozone promulgated under section 109 of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n        7409); or\n            (2) propose, before such date, any revisions to such \n        criteria or standards.\n\nSEC. 6.

    "reference": ".  Federal Spectrum Incentive Act of 2013 - Amends the National Telecommunications and Information Administration Organization Act to allow federal entities that utilize government station licenses to participate in the incentive auction program under which licensees of electromagnetic spectrum voluntarily relinquish their spectrum rights in order for such spectrum to be auctioned for a repurposed commercial use in exchange for a percentage of the auction proceeds. Permits such federal entities, instead of being reimbursed for the costs of sharing frequencies with nonfederal users or relocating to other frequencies as provided for under current law, to receive a percentage of the proceeds from spectrum it relinquishes for auction by electing to: (1) discontinue operations on eligible frequencies without relocating to other frequencies, or (2) relocate operations to frequencies assigned to another federal entity in order for such entities to share frequencies. Establishes in the U.S. Treasury a Federal Spectrum Incentive Fund to be administered by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in consultation with the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). Requires 1% of the proceeds from such auctions to be deposited in such Fund and the remainder to be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury for the sole purpose of deficit reduction. Directs OMB to transfer from the Fund to a federal entity a specified amount attributable to the auction of frequencies vacated by such entity. Permits federal entities to use such amounts for: (1) any purposes permitted under the terms and conditions of an appropriations account that was subject to sequestration for any fiscal year under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, provided that the amount used does not exceed the amount by which the account was reduced by sequestration for such fiscal year; or (2) a transfer of amounts to an incumbent federal entity for such purposes when the federal entity relinquishing spectrum relocates its operations to frequencies assigned to another federal entity in order to share frequencies."

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) In the construction industry, specialty subcontractors \n        now perform the majority of construction work, in certain cases \n        100 percent of the work, under the management of a prime \n        contractor, making the subcontractors' price and performance \n        the key determinant in the overall cost of construction \n        projects, including those performed for the Federal Government.\n            (2) Detrimental practices known as ``bid shopping'' and \n        ``bid peddling'' exist in the construction industry, including \n        construction projects for the Federal Government.\n            (3) ``Bid shopping'' occurs when a contractor, after award \n        of a contract, contracts with subcontractors at a price less \n        than the quoted price of the subcontractor upon which the \n        contractor's fixed bid price was based, in order to increase \n        the contractor's profit on the project without any benefit to \n        the entity for which the contract is being performed.\n            (4) ``Bid peddling'' occurs when a subcontractor that is \n        not selected for inclusion in a contractor's team seeks to \n        induce the contractor, after award of the contract, to \n        substitute the subcontractor for another subcontractor whose \n        bid price was reflected in the successful bid of the contractor \n        by offering to reduce its price for performance of the \n        specified work, suggesting that the previous offer of the \n        subcontractor was padded or incorrect.\n            (5) Bid shopping and bid peddling--\n                    (A) threaten the integrity of the competitive bid \n                system for construction that benefits the Federal \n                Government, the construction industry, and the economy \n                of the United States as a whole;\n                    (B) compromise national security by promoting \n                uncertainty about which contractors actually perform \n                work on critical infrastructure projects;\n                    (C) deprive taxpayers of the benefits of full and \n                open competition among prospective contractors and \n                subcontractors for the performance of Federal \n                construction projects;\n                    (D) expose Federal construction projects to the \n                dangers of substandard performance, substitution of \n                lower quality materials, and other detrimental cost-\n                cutting practices by an unscrupulous substituted \n                subcontractor; and\n                    (E) can be effectively deterred in Federal \n                construction by modifying the Federal Acquisition \n                Regulation to require bid listing, which is the \n                practice of requiring each offeror for a Federal \n                construction contract to list the subcontractors whose \n                performance is reflected in the bid price, procedures \n                for the substitution of listed subcontractors for good \n                cause, and other deterrents to abuse.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Contract.--The term ``contract'' means any contract \n        with the Federal Government, exceeding $1,000,000 in amount, \n        for the construction, alteration, or repair of any public \n        building or public work of the United States.\n            (2) Contractor.--The term ``contractor'' means an \n        individual or entity that has been awarded or is seeking to be \n        awarded a construction contract by the Federal Government.\n            (3) Subcontractor.--The term ``subcontractor'' means an \n        individual or entity that subcontracts with a contractor in an \n        amount in excess of $100,000 for work on a contract.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The greatness of America is measured in many ways but \n        nowhere is it better reflected than in the costs paid by the \n        men and women who voluntarily assumed the risk of defending the \n        freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and who, without \n        reluctance or mental reservation, made the supreme sacrifice \n        for their country.\n            (2) It is altogether fitting and proper for the friends and \n        families of those fallen in battle to be able to mourn their \n        loss in peace and take comfort and pride in the consolation \n        that comes from the certain knowledge that they laid so costly \n        a sacrifice on the altar of freedom.\n            (3) That to secure this temporary but hallowed moment of \n        peace, reflection, and healing, it is appropriate to place \n        reasonable restrictions on those individuals and groups who \n        seek to use the occasion of a funeral, burial, or memorial \n        service of a veteran to stage a public demonstration intended \n        to turn a private gathering of private persons into a public \n        spectacle for the unconscionable purpose of attracting public \n        attention and gratuitously inflicting unnecessary emotional \n        pain on the deceased veteran's families and friends.\n            (4) Funerals, memorial services, and bereavement ceremonies \n        are special events warranting special respect for the deceased \n        and due regard for the emotional well-being of the bereaved \n        whose memories of the final moments before their loved one is \n        laid to rest may be permanently stained were the occasion \n        allowed to be exploited by others for the purpose of attracting \n        public attention by the intentional infliction of emotional \n        distress on the loved ones of the deceased.\n            (5) The First Amendment that veterans risked their lives to \n        defend and preserve is broad and strong enough to protect \n        vigorous and robust public debate on public issues and generous \n        enough to accommodate the natural desire and need of relatives \n        and loved ones to be free to mourn their loss in peace.\n\nSEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON DEMONSTRATIONS WHERE FUNERALS, MEMORIAL \n              SERVICES, AND CEREMONIES FOR VETERANS ARE HELD.\n\n    (a) In General.--Section 2413 of title 38, United States Code, is \namended to read as follows:\n``Sec. 2413.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., a nonprofit corporation \n        described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n        1986 and headquartered in New York, has since 1998 educated and \n        supported the community, law enforcement, criminal justice, and \n        government agencies on issues related to sex offender \n        registration, notification, responsible use of information, \n        sexual abuse and abduction prevention, Internet Safety, and \n        crime victim support.\n            (2) Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., established and operates \n        the National Megan's Law Helpline, a free confidential \n        telephone helpline that provides information, support, and \n        criminal justice referrals, nationally and internationally, on \n        sex offender management issues. Parents for Megan's Law, Inc. \n        is a certified rape crisis center and provides support and \n        assistance to child and adult victims of sexual abuse and all \n        victims of violent crime. Research suggests that sexual assault \n        victims who receive counseling support are more likely to \n        report their attack to the police and participate in the \n        prosecution of the offender.\n            (3) The National Megan's Law Helpline has generated over \n        70,000 requests for assistance, information, or follow-up \n        contacts on sex offender management, crime victim support, and \n        prevention education issues. Helpline requests utilize the \n        Helpline's resources and often entail coordination with outside \n        resources, follow-up calls, or actual referrals to any or all \n        of the following: law enforcement and other criminal justice \n        agencies, state and local crime victims assistance agencies and \n        organizations, social service and human service providers, and \n        other service provider organizations.\n            (4) The Internet website of Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., \n        serves as a clearinghouse and national resource for information \n        related to sex offender registration, notification, sexual \n        abuse and abduction prevention, and crime victims' support and \n        referrals. Such Internet website is also utilized by the public \n        to anonymously report Internet child pornography and child sex \n        tourism and as a resource for Internet Safety education. \n        Reports are forwarded to local law enforcement for appropriate \n        follow-up.\n            (5)(A) With limited resources, the National Megan's Law \n        Helpline has provided the public with a resource for \n        confidentially reporting registered sex offenders failing to \n        comply with registration requirements, supervision, or \n        employment restrictions or who are in positions of trust where \n        potential child victims can be accessed. Confidential tips are \n        triaged, crime victim support is provided, and referrals are \n        made to the appropriate criminal justice agency for follow-up \n        action.\n            (B) In fact, because of anonymous tips to the Helpline, \n        actions have been taken to mitigate potentially dangerous \n        situations, including--\n                    (i) sending a registered sex offender back to \n                prison after he was identified as residing in a \n                registered child day care center where he could access \n                potential child victims;\n                    (ii) preventing a convicted former middle school \n                teacher required to register as a sex offender and give \n                up his teacher's license, from gaining employment as an \n                in home children's tutor for a reputable tutoring \n                company where he could gain unsupervised access to \n                potential child victims;\n                    (iii) having a registered sex offender who targeted \n                a child, and subsequently was barred from using the \n                Internet to develop online relationships, removed from \n                an Internet Dating service where he attempted to \n                develop a relationship with whom he believed was a \n                single woman with children;\n                    (iv) sending a registered sex offender, who was on \n                parole for a weapons charge and restricted from \n                entering school grounds, back to prison for entering \n                school grounds and drug possession;\n                    (v) identifying and reporting a registered sex \n                offender, convicted of sexually victimizing a 4-year-\n                old boy while baby-sitting, who had absconded and \n                failed to register; and\n                    (vi) identifying, locating and reporting registered \n                sex offenders in violation of conditions of probation, \n                parole, local employment or other restriction laws.\n            (6) A national Sex Offender Registration Compliance survey \n        conducted by Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., in 2003, indicated \n        that, 24 percent of (or over 100,000) registered sex offenders \n        were not complying with sex offender registration laws. Sex \n        offender registry information provides parents and community \n        members an opportunity to protect themselves, their children, \n        and their communities from sexual victimization, but that \n        information, in order to be of value, requires labor intensive \n        follow-up intervention and proactive maintenance to be kept \n        current.\n            (7) Access to the National Criminal Information databases \n        is necessary for Parents for Megan's Law, Inc., to effectively \n        evaluate the veracity of tips received, proactively research \n        noncompliant registrants or registrants engaged in criminal \n        activities and provide law enforcement with viable accurate \n        information for follow-up action.\n            (8) The Sex Offender Registration Tips (SORT) Program will \n        reduce sexual victimization and increase sex offender \n        registration compliance through community tips and proactive \n        maintenance.\n            (9) Authorizing federal funds for the SORT Program will \n        reduce criminal sexual victimization by--\n                    (A) supporting crime victims seeking assistance;\n                    (B) supporting sex offender registration, \n                notification, and sexual abuse and abduction prevention \n                education and Internet Safety inquiries; and\n                    (C) providing the public two interactive \n                confidential resources, the Helpline and Internet \n                website, for the public to provide information--\n                            (i) about registered sex offenders who are \n                        believed to be out of compliance with \n                        registration requirements, supervision, or \n                        employment restrictions and who are in \n                        positions of trust where potential child \n                        victims can be accessed; or\n                            (ii) concerning sex offender activities \n                        that indicate a heightened risk of re-\n                        offending.\n            (10)(A) The SORT program will serve as a powerful national \n        tool supporting communities and crime victims while assisting \n        and advancing the mission of Federal, state, and local law \n        enforcement in combating sexual victimization.\n            (B) The SORT program and the National Megan's Law Helpline \n        is unique in the following ways:\n                    (i) It provides up to date sexual abuse prevention \n                information, deters vigilantism, and reinforces \n                responsible use of information.\n                    (ii) It provides victims who come forth with needed \n                information with an infrastructure of advocacy, \n                enforcement, and therapeutic support.\n                    (iii) It maximizes law enforcement's already \n                strained resources by screening anonymous tips promptly \n                and effectively through the use of trained \n                investigators with access to public, private and law \n                enforcement databases.\n\nSEC. 3.

Directs DHS to coordinate with the OMB to: (1) update government information security metrics to include measures of intrusion and incident detection and response times, and (2) display additional metrics about agency cybersecurity postures on federal government performance websites.  Authorizes DHS, upon an agency's request, to operate and maintain technology that is deployed to agencies to diagnose and mitigate cyber threats and vulnerabilities. Requires DHS to regularly assess and require implementation of best practices for securing agency information systems and preventing data exfiltration. Redefines for purposes of DHS's national cybersecurity and communications integration center: (1) \"cybersecurity risk\" to exclude actions that solely involve a violation of a consumer term of service or a consumer licensing agreement; and (2) \"incident\" to include occurrences that actually or imminently jeopardize, without lawful authority, an information system, thereby replacing a standard that currently includes a violation or imminent threat of violation of law, security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. Requires DHS to assist agencies in implementing information security practices by: (1) providing incident detection, analysis, mitigation, and response information, disseminating related homeland security information, and providing remote or onsite technical assistance; (2) developing and conducting impact assessments in consultation with other governmental and private entities; (3) assessing and fostering technologies for use across multiple agencies; and (4) ensuring that policies are coordinated with standards for national security systems and policies of the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Director of National Intelligence. Authorizes the DHS Secretary to: (1) issue a directive to an agency to take any lawful action with respect to the operation of an agency's information system in response to a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, risk, or incident, including an act of terrorism, that represents a substantial threat to information security; or (2) authorize, without prior consultation with the affected agency, the use of protective capabilities under the Secretary's control for communications or system traffic transiting to or from or stored on an agency information system if there is an imminent threat and a directive is unlikely to be timely.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that:\n            (1) The blackout of August 2003 in the Northeast, Midwest, \n        and adjoining parts of Canada highlighted the need for \n        infrastructure and operating improvements.\n            (2) In 2005 Hurricane Wilma destroyed power in most of \n        southern Florida, and within 6 months, Florida utility \n        regulators inserted requirements that utilities harden their \n        system over time and create a regular schedule of clearing \n        vegetation from power lines to ensure electric reliability.\n            (3) In Iowa, in 2008, over two dozen people were killed and \n        148 injured as a result of flooding. Flood warnings covered a \n        span of about 325 miles from Dubuque, Iowa to St. Louis, \n        Missouri with over 35,000 families evacuated from their homes.\n            (4) The devastation from Hurricane Katrina and its \n        calamitous results can still be seen across the Gulf Coast. \n        Hurricane Katrina cost over 1,800 lives, billions of dollars in \n        damage and catastrophic loss and the largest single loss in the \n        history of insurance at $40.6 billion with more than 1.7 \n        million claims across 6 States (Louisiana, Mississippi, \n        Alabama, Florida, Tennessee, and Georgia).\n            (5) Early estimates of Hurricane Ike's destruction are $9.8 \n        billion in insured damages, which would make it the 4th most \n        expensive hurricane in the history of the United States, \n        according to the Insurance Information Institute. Hurricane \n        Katrina caused $43 billion in damages.\n            (6) Cedric Delane passed away September 14, 2008, due in \n        part to a lack of electricity and not being identified as part \n        of the vulnerable class of people that needed assistance \n        immediately. Cedric was a 5th grade student at Blackshear \n        Elementary in Houston, Texas. Cedric was an asthmatic and \n        suffered a severe attack during Hurricane Ike. The lack of \n        electrical power prevented the use of his breathing machine, \n        which could possibly have saved his life. The paramedics were \n        called and Cedric was transported to the hospital, but he did \n        not survive.\n            (7) There have been more than 370,000 overnight shelter \n        stays, over 8.77 million meals served, and over 190,000 clean-\n        up kits and comfort kits distributed in the Houston-Galveston \n        area of Texas after Hurricanes Gustav and Ike.\n            (8) The Texas Public Utility Commissioners did not require \n        electric companies on the coast to ensure reliability in their \n        distribution systems against hurricanes after the Texas Public \n        Utility Commission staff recommended aggressive tree-trimming \n        programs and major upgrades, including replacing wooden \n        electric polls with metal or concrete polls in 2005 after \n        Hurricane Rita.\n            (9) Texas Public utility companies fought the \n        recommendations on the grounds that upgrading the distribution \n        system would cost far more than repairing it after a storm, \n        however the Texas Public Utility Commission ordered a cost-\n        benefit analysis of only one recommendation: moving electric \n        substations out of flood zones.\n            (10) There were 28 Houston-area deaths attributed to \n        Hurricane Ike with over a half a million people without \n        electrical power for more than a week including many elderly, \n        disabled, and medically-dependent persons.\n            (11) Without criminal enforcement of reliability standards \n        with penalties by FERC and cost-benefit studies that include \n        United States Census and Federal Emergency Management Agency \n        data on vulnerable populations and loss of electricity on those \n        populations, greater loss of property and life will occur.\n\nSEC. 3. FERC ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.\n\n    Section 215(e) of the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824o) is amended \nas follows:\n            (1) In paragraph (1) by striking ``ERO may impose, subject \n        to paragraph (2),'' and inserting ``Commission may impose'' and \n        by striking ``if the ERO'' and inserting ``if the Commission''.\n            (2) Paragraph (2) is amended to read as follows:\n            ``(2) Any person who violates any standard approved by the \n        Commission under subsection (d) shall, upon conviction, be \n        fined in accordance with title 18, United States Code, or \n        imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.''.\n            (3) Paragraph (4) is repealed.\n            (4) In paragraph (6) by striking ``penalty imposed under \n        this section'' and inserting ``civil penalty imposed under \n        paragraph (1) of this section''.\n\nSEC. 4. DISTURBANCES LASTING LONGER THAN 5 DAYS.\n\n    Within 180 days after the enactment of this Act the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission shall issue a rule under section 215 of the \nFederal Power Act amending the reliability standards under that section \nto prohibit disturbances (other than planned maintenance) lasting \ngreater than 5 days at substations subject to section 215.\n\nSEC. 5. STUDY AND REPORT ON EMERGENCY PLANNING PREPAREDNESS FOR \n              VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.\n\n    (a) Study.--The Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, \nacting through the Assistant Secretary of the Office of the \nInfrastructure Protection, shall conduct a study to examine gaps in \nemergency planning preparedness and management as related to vulnerable \npopulations including--\n            (1) individuals with physical and mental disabilities, \n        visual impairments, hearing impairments, limited English \n        proficiency, and literacy barriers;\n            (2) socially and economically disadvantaged households and \n        communities;\n            (3) individuals over 65 years old;\n            (4) minor children; and\n            (5) individuals with pets or service animals.\n    (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \nenactment of this Act the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, acting through the Assistant Secretary of the Office of the \nInfrastructure Protection, shall submit to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report containing the \nresults of the study under subsection (a) and any recommendations of \nthe Secretary.",

In such case, the attorney \n                general of a State shall provide notice and a copy of \n                the complaint to the Commission at the same time as the \n                attorney general files the action.\n    (b) Intervention.--\n            (1) In general.--On receiving notice under subsection \n        (a)(2), the Commission shall have the right to intervene in the \n        action that is the subject of the notice.\n            (2) Effect of intervention.--If the Commission intervenes \n        in an action under subsection (a), it shall have the right--\n                    (A) to be heard with respect to any matter that \n                arises in that action; and\n                    (B) to file a petition for appeal.\n    (c) Construction.--For purposes of bringing any civil action under \nsubsection (a), nothing in this title shall\nbe construed to prevent an attorney general of a State from exercising \nthe powers conferred on the attorney general by the laws of that State \nto--\n            (1) conduct investigations;\n            (2) administer oaths or affirmations; or\n            (3) compel the attendance of witnesses or the production of \n        documentary and other evidence.\n    (d) Actions by the Commission.--In any case in which an action is \ninstituted by or on behalf of the Commission for a violation of section \n3, no State may, during the pendency of that action, institute an \naction under subsection (a) against any defendant named in the \ncomplaint in that action--\n    (e) Venue.--Any action brought under subsection (a) may be brought \nin the district court of the United States that meets applicable \nrequirements relating to venue under section 1391 of title 28, United \nStates Code.\n    (f) Service of Process.--In an action brought under subsection (a), \nprocess may be served in any district in which the defendant--\n            (1) is an inhabitant; or\n            (2) may be found.\n\nSEC. 6.

    "reference": "Sports Agent Responsibility and Trust Act - Prohibits an agent from: (1) directly or indirectly recruiting or soliciting a student athlete to enter into an agency contract by giving false or misleading information or making a false promise or representation or by providing anything of value to the athlete before entering into such a contract; (2) entering into an agency contract with a student athlete without providing the required disclosure document; or (3) predating or postdating an agency contract.Requires an agent, in conjunction with the signing of an agency contract, to provide to the athlete a separate disclosure document that includes notice that if the athlete signs the contract he or she may lose eligibility to compete as a student athlete in that sport. Requires the student athlete to sign such document before signing the agency contract.Treats a violation of this Act as an unfair or deceptive act or practice under the Federal Trade Commission Act. Authorizes civil actions by State attorneys general under specified circumstances.Requires the agent and the athlete, within 72 hours after entering into an agency contract or before the next athletic event in which the athlete may participate, whichever occurs first, to provide notice to the educational institution that the athlete has entered into an agency contract. Grants an educational institution a right of action against an agent for damages caused by such agent's failure to provide such notice.Expresses the sense of Congress that States should enact the Uniform Athlete Agents Act of 2000 drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws to protect student athletes and the integrity of amateur sports from unscrupulous sports agents."
