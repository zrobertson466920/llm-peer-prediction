  "reference": "health - related quality of life ( hrqol ) is a multidimensional concept that defines a person 's health based on specific aspects , such as physical , emotional , and social functioning and general welfare ( 1 ) . \n the assessment of hrqol consists of an evaluation of the degree to which these aspects are decreased by symptoms , incapacities , and limitations caused by disease ( 2 ) . \n the assessment of hrqol has been used as a measure complementary to bone mineral density to evaluate and monitor the burden of osteoporosis on a patient 's daily life ( 3 ) . \n there are several instruments that can be used to assess the quality of life of individuals with osteoporosis , including the osteoporosis assessment questionnaire , the quality of life questionnaire for osteoporosis ( optqol ) , the osteoporosis quality of life questionnaire , and the questionnaire of the european foundation for osteoporosis ( qualeffo ) ( 4 - 7 ) . \n the qualeffo , a specific tool used to evaluate subjects with vertebral fractures and that includes questions on pain , physical functioning , social functioning , general health perception and mental functioning , has been shown to be repeatable and consistent ( 7 - 8 ) . \n vertebral fractures are the most frequent osteoporotic fractures , occurring in at least 30% of the elderly population ( 9 ) , and have important clinical implications ( 10 - 14 ) . \n these fractures are associated with increased risks of new osteoporotic fractures and mortality , especially in older women ( 10 - 11 ) . \n only one - third of vertebral fractures are symptomatic ; therefore , patients may be unaware of their presence . \n indeed , in studies based on the radiographic screening of populations , the incidence of all vertebral fractures has been estimated to be three times higher than the incidence of hip fractures , and only 30% of people with vertebral fractures were found to have received medical attention ( 12 ) . women with vertebral fractures can also experience decreased hrqol due to physical limitations and psychosocial disabilities ( 13 - 14 ) . \n some studies have assessed the impact of vertebral fractures on hrqol in older women in many countries ( 15,16 ) , but few such epidemiological studies have been conducted in brazil . \n moreover , most of the studies conducted in this country have been performed in ambulatory or institutionalized individuals ( 17,18 ) . \n therefore , this study evaluated the impact of vertebral fractures on the quality of life of healthy , community - dwelling women aged 65 years or older using the qualeffo . \n this study was performed using the framework of the so paulo ageing & health study ( spah ) , which was a population - based , cross - sectional study ( 9 ) . \n the inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as those of the core study ( 9 ) . \n all of the individuals were apparently healthy and showed no evidence of malabsorption , chronic diarrhea , hepatic disease , severe chronic diseases , or cancer . \n current or previous bisphosphonate use was also an exclusion criterion ( 9 ) . quality of life was assessed through individual interviews using the validated qualeffo with 41 questions covering five domains : pain ( 5 questions ) , physical functioning ( 17 questions ) , social functioning ( sevn questions ) , general health perception ( three questions ) , and mental functioning ( nine questions ) ( 7 ) . \n the total score for each domain was obtained by summing the scores of all questions for that domain and submitting this sum to a linear transformation to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 , where 0 corresponds to the worst hrqol and 100 to the best hrqol . \n radiographs of the lumbar and thoracic spine centered on l2 and t7 , respectively , were obtained for all participants , with 40 \" between the tube and the film . \n the identification of vertebral fractures was performed by two individuals with experience in the field of analyzing vertebral fractures . \n they were blinded to each other 's assessments , and when the results conflicted , a consensus between the two individuals was reached . \n the agreement between the assessments of the two individuals was 96% , and the kappa coefficient was 0.82 . \n each identified fractured vertebra was assigned a grade based on the genant sq scale , where mild ( grade 1 ) corresponds to a 20 - 25% reduction in the anterior , middle , and/or posterior height ; moderate ( grade 2 ) corresponds to a 26 - 40% reduction in any height ; and severe ( grade 3 ) corresponds to a reduction of over 40% in any height . \n the height ( without shoes ) of each participant was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a wall - mounted stadiometer . \n the weight of each participant ( without shoes and wearing only light clothing ) was measured to the nearest 0.25 kg using a double - beam balance scale . \n the body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated by dividing the participant 's weight ( kilograms ) by her height squared ( square meters ) , and the subjects were categorized using the following cutoff points proposed by the world health organization ( who ) : normal weight  =  bmi<25 ; overweight  =  25bmi<30 ; and obese  =  bmi30 ( 20 ) . \n information regarding health , lifestyle and risk factors for osteoporosis / fractures was obtained through individual interviews . \n women who had had two or more falls in the last 12 months were defined as chronic fallers ( 21 ) . \n physical activity was classified as ( a ) low , does not even perform housework ; ( b ) moderate , performs regular housework , walks irregularly , and gardens ; and ( c ) high , performs regular physical activity aside from her daily routine at least twice a week for 30 min ( 22 ) . \n regarding concomitant diseases , those mentioned at the time of the interview were noted , as well as those diagnosed during the physical examination . systemic arterial hypertension ( sah ) was defined as a history of hypertension with the use of antihypertensive drugs or a systolic blood pressure>140 mmhg and/or diastolic blood pressure>90 mmhg , which was measured with a standard sphygmomanometer with the subject seated for at least 5 minutes prior to the measurement ( 23 ) . \n participants taking oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin or those with fasting blood glucose levels126 mg / dl were considered to be diabetic ( 24 ) . \n the bmd was measured by dual x - ray absorptiometry ( dxa ) using hologic densitometry equipment ( hologic inc . \n bedford , ma , usa , discovery model ) in the following regions : lumbar spine , femoral neck , and total femur . \n anatomically abnormal vertebrae were excluded from the analysis of the lumbar spine only if they were clearly abnormal and were not assessable within the resolution of the system or if there was a difference in the t - score of more than 1.0 between the vertebra in question and adjacent vertebrae , as recommended by the international society for clinical densitometry ( iscd ) ( 25 ) . \n the precision of the bmd measurements was determined based on standard iscd protocols ( 26 ) . \n we calculated the least significant change with 95% confidence to be 0.033 g / cm for the spine , 0.047 g / cm for the femoral neck , and 0.039 g / cm for the total femur . according to the classification criteria of the iscd ( international society of clinical densitometry ) , the lowest t - score among the three sites ( lumbar spine , femoral neck , and total femur ) was used to classify each participant as having osteoporosis , osteopenia , or normal bone density . \n thus , the individuals with t - scores that were 2.5 standard deviations or more below the scores for healthy controls for the peak bone mass were diagnosed with osteoporosis , individuals with t - scores between 2.5 and 1.0 standard deviations below the scores for healthy controls were diagnosed with osteopenia , and individuals with t - scores greater than 1.0 standard deviation below the scores for healthy controls were classified as normal ( 26 ) . \n the sample size of 180 was based on a standard deviation of 15% ( 27 ) for the total qualeffo score and a two - sided 5% significance level . \n the study had 95% power to detect a difference of 10 points in the total qualeffo score . \n the results for the quantitative variables are expressed as the mean ( standard deviation ) , and results for the qualitative variables are described by the absolute and relative ( % ) frequencies . \n demographic characteristics and the qualeffo results were compared between women with and without fractures using the mann - whitney - wilcoxon test for quantitative variables and the chi - square test for qualitative variables . \n the associations between the qualeffo scores and potential determinants of quality of life were assessed using the wilcoxon rank - sum test or the kruskal - wallis test . \n correlations between continuous variables and the qualeffo questionnaire data were tested using the spearman correlation coefficient ( rs ) ....",
