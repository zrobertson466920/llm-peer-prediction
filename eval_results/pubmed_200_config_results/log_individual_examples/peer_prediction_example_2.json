threatening conditions  ( rizk et al . , 1990 ) . among the serious manifestations of ohss are ascites and pleural effusion  ( rizk and smitz , 1992 ) . \n vascular endothelial growth factor has emerged as one of the factors most likely involved in the pathophysiology of ohss  ( geva and jaffe , 2000 ; rizk and aboulghar , 2010 ) . \n vascular endothelial growth factor is an angiogenic cytokine that is a potent stimulator of the vascular endothelium and appears to play an integral role in follicular growth , corpus luteum function and ovarian angiogenesis  ( rizk et al . , 1997 ) . \n vascular endothelial growth factor causes increased capillary permeability with its sequelae of ascites and possible pleural effusion  ( rizk et al . , 1997 ; gomez et al . , 2002 ) . \n human chorionic gonadotrophin is thought to play a crucial role in the development of ohss  ( rizk et al . \n two distinct forms of severe ohss have been described : early and late forms  ( papanikolaou et al . , 2005 ; mathur et al . , 2000 ) . \n early ohss is caused by the administration of exogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin  ( hcg ) and it starts before the 10th day after oocyte retrieval , while the late form is the result of endogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin release in the event of pregnancy , and it starts after the 10th day following oocyte aspiration  ( papanikolaou et al . , 2005 ; \n such strategies included the use of low dose gonadotropins and frequent monitoring during controlled ovarian stimulation , cycle cancellation , coasting , freeze all embryos and the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone  ( gnrh ) agonist as an oocyte trigger in gnrh antagonist cycles  ( rizk et al . \n the use of antagonist in the luteal phase with total freeze of embryos to prevent severe ohss has also been suggested  ( lainas et al . , 2012 ) . \n such strategies should be used especially in patients at high risk for developing severe ohss , including those who are young , have low body weight , have polycystic ovary syndrome , those who experience high estradiol levels , rapidly increasing estradiol levels , high number of follicles during controlled ovarian stimulation and those with high number of oocytes retrieved  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ; delvigne , 2009 ) . \n dopamine agonists have been proposed for the prevention of ohss in women at high risk . however , the study by lvarez et al . \n ( 2007 ) suggested that it was only effective in reducing the incidence of moderate ohss , but not in its severe form  ( alvarez et al . , 2007 ) . \n low - dose aspirin therapy and doxycycline have also been suggested to inhibit angiogenesis  ( fainaru et al . , 2009 ) . \n ( 2011 ) believes that the concept of an ohss - free clinic has become a reality . \n the authors suggest that this approach should include pituitary down - regulation using a gnrh antagonist , ovulation triggering with a gnrh agonist and vitrification of oocytes or embryos  ( devroey et al . , 2011 ) . \n severe and critical forms of ohss are associated with significant ascites  ( golan et al . , 1989 ; rizk et al . , \n ascites results in an increased abdominal pressure compromising venous return , cardiac output and renal perfusion  ( navot et al . \n paracentesis is frequently needed , as prompt drainage of fluid produces a significant clinical and biochemical improvement , including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process  ( rizk et al . \n , multiple paracenteses may be required to relieve symptoms and avoid serious sequelae of hemoconcentration , hypotension , decreased renal perfusion and severe respiratory compromise . instead of multiple interventions , \n the placement of a catheter temporarily for a few days will permit complete drainage through one procedure  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ) . \n pigtail catheters have been used for drainage in various clinical situations . in a previous study we described the use of percutaneous placement of a pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites caused by severe / critical ohss  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) . \n in this study we established the efficacy and safety of pigtail catheter drainage in the management of severe / critical ohss in patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer at our centre between 1999 and 2001 on both inpatient and outpatient basis . \n the aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with early onset severe ohss . \n this is a retrospective study that included all patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and developed severe or critical ohss by the golan classification  ( golan et al . , 1989 ) in the period between 2004 and 2009 . \n all patients underwent an ultrasound evaluation which documented the presence of severe ascites and bilateral ovarian enlargement . \n all patients presented with shortness of breath , marked abdominal distension , nausea , weight gain and lower abdominal pain . \n thirteen patients complained of vomiting , and 3 patients reported decreased urine output  ( less than 720 cc per 24  hours ) and had haemoglobin   15 g / dl . \n all 33 patients were offered treatment using pigtail catheter insertion as an alternative to trans -

    "- Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a significant complication in 1-10% of in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients, characterized by clinical manifestations ranging from mild symptoms to severe, life-threatening conditions such as ascites and pleural effusion. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is implicated in the pathophysiology of OHSS, leading to increased capillary permeability and fluid accumulation in the abdomen.\n\n- Two forms of severe OHSS are identified: early and late.
