    "objectiveearly developmental adaptations in response to undernutrition may play an essential role in susceptibility to type 2 diabetes , particularly for those experiencing a  mismatched rich nutritional environment  in later life . \n we examined the associations of exposure to the chinese famine ( 19591961 ) during fetal life and childhood with the risk of hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes in adulthood.research design and methodswe used the data for 7,874 rural adults born between 1954 and 1964 in selected communities from the cross - sectional 2002 china national nutrition and health survey . \n hyperglycemia was defined as fasting plasma glucose 6.1 mmol / l and/or 2-h plasma glucose 7.8 \n mmol / l and/or a previous clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.resultsprevalences of hyperglycemia among adults in nonexposed , fetal exposed , early - childhood , mid - childhood , and late - childhood exposed cohorts were 2.4% , 5.7% , 3.9% , 3.4% , and 5.9% , respectively . in severely affected famine areas , \n fetal - exposed subjects had an increased risk of hyperglycemia compared with nonexposed subjects ( odds ratio = 3.92 ; 95% ci : 1.649.39 ; p = 0.002 ) ; this difference was not observed in less severely affected famine areas ( odds ratio = 0.57 ; 95% ci : 0.251.31 ; p = 0.185 ) . \n the odds ratios were significantly different between groups from the severe and less severe famine areas ( p for interaction = 0.001 ) . in severely affected famine areas , fetal - exposed subjects who followed an affluent / western dietary pattern ( odds ratios = 7.63 ; 95% ci : 2.4124.1 ; p = 0.0005 ) or who had a higher economic status in later life experienced a substantially elevated risk of hyperglycemia ( odds ratios = 6.20 ; 95% ci : 2.0818.5 ; p = 0.001).conclusionsfetal exposure to the severe chinese famine increases the risk of hyperglycemia in adulthood . \n this association appears to be exacerbated by a nutritionally rich environment in later life .",
    "- The 2002 China National Nutrition and Health Survey (CNNHS) employed a multistage probability cluster sampling design to analyze nutrition and chronic diseases among a representative population across six regions of China.  \n- Subjects were divided into five exposure cohorts based on their birth years, which corresponded to their exposure to the Chinese famine, with analysis focusing on differences in hyperglycemia and type 2 diabetes prevalence among these cohorts.  \n- The severity of famine exposure was categorized based on excess death rates, allowing researchers to examine the stronger effects of famine in severely affected areas compared to less affected ones.  \n- The study analyzed various factors including dietary patterns, economic status, and BMI to assess the impact of nutritional environments on health outcomes in adulthood, while adjusting for demographic and lifestyle variables.
