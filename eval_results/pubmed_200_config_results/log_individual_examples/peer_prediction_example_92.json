    "- Mastitis is the leading cause of antimicrobial use in dairy cows, yet there is no consensus on the most effective treatment methods.  \n- Evidence-based medicine principles should guide the treatment of mastitis, considering factors like pharmacokinetics and the potential for antimicrobial resistance.  \n- Treatment strategies should be tailored to the specific pathogen causing mastitis, with a preference for narrow-spectrum antimicrobials and extended treatment durations for improved cure rates.  \n- Systemic treatments are recommended for severe cases of coliform mastitis and infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, while the use of on-farm protocols can enhance the judicious use of antimicrobials.  ",
    "- Intramammary infection, or mastitis, is the leading cause for antimicrobial use in dairy cows, with ongoing debate regarding the most effective and economical treatment options.\n- Antimicrobial resistance is emerging among some mastitis pathogens, particularly penicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, while most streptococci remain susceptible to penicillin.\n- The review discusses pharmacokinetics of antimicrobials, noting that intramammary administration can achieve higher concentrations in milk compared to systemic routes, but it may also pose risks such as uneven distribution and potential infection.\n- Evidence-based treatment protocols are recommended, emphasizing the need for targeted antimicrobial therapy based on the causative bacteria and the importance of adjusting treatment duration to improve cure rates, particularly for infections caused by S. aureus and Streptococcus uberis.",
    "- Mastitis is the primary reason for antimicrobial use in dairy cows, yet there remains a lack of consensus on the most effective, safe, and economical treatment approaches, necessitating evidence-based medicine to guide therapeutic decisions. This review aims to evaluate current lactation treatments for mastitis and provide best practice recommendations based on available evidence.\n\n- Pharmacokinetics play a crucial role in the effectiveness of antimicrobials, with factors such as lipid solubility and protein binding affecting their penetration into milk and distribution in the udder. Antimicrobials must be selected for their low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against target pathogens, with a preference for bactericidal agents due to impaired phagocytosis in the mammary gland.\n\n- The emergence of antimicrobial resistance, particularly among staphylococci like Staphylococcus aureus, poses significant challenges; penicillin-resistant strains are associated with lower cure rates. In contrast, streptococci remain susceptible to penicillin G, though resistance to macrolides is emerging. The choice of administration route (intramammary vs. systemic) should be guided by the pathogen's characteristics.\n\n- Treatment protocols should be tailored to the specific bacteria causing mastitis, with a preference for narrow-spectrum antimicrobials, especially for streptococci and penicillin-susceptible staphylococci. The recommended treatment duration is often longer than label indications, particularly for S. aureus and Streptococcus uberis, to improve cure rates, and the treatment of subclinical mastitis is generally deemed economically unfeasible during lactation.",
