    "background and objectivehumans are increasingly exposed to near - infrared ( nir ) radiation from both natural ( eg , solar ) and artificial ( eg , electrical appliances ) sources . \n although the biological effects of sun and ultraviolet ( uv ) exposure have been extensively investigated , the biological effect of nir radiation is still unclear . \n we previously reported that nir as well as uv induces photoaging and standard uv - blocking materials , such as sunglasses , do not sufficiently block nir . \n the objective of this study was to investigate changes in gene expression in three - dimensional reconstructed corneal epithelial tissue culture exposed to broad - spectrum nir irradiation to simulate solar nir radiation that reaches human tissues.materials and methodsdna microarray and quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction analysis were used to assess gene expression levels in a three - dimensional reconstructed corneal epithelial model composed of normal human corneal epithelial cells exposed to water - filtered broad - spectrum nir irradiation with a contact cooling ( 20c ) . \n the water - filter allowed 1,0001,800 nm wavelengths and excluded 1,4001,500 nm wavelengths.resultsa dna microarray with > 62,000 different probes showed 25 and 150 genes that were up- or downregulated by at least fourfold and twofold , respectively , after nir irradiation . in particular , epidermal growth factor receptor ( egfr ) was upregulated by 19.4-fold relative to control cells . \n quantitative real - time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that two variants of egfr in human corneal epithelial tissue were also significantly upregulated after five rounds of 10 j / cm2 irradiation ( p<0.05).conclusionwe found that nir irradiation induced the upregulated expression of egfr in human corneal cells . since over half of the solar energy reaching the earth is in the nir region , which can not be adequately blocked by eyewear and thus can induce eye damage with intensive or long - term exposure , protection from both uv and nir radiation may prevent changes in gene expression and in turn eye damage .",
