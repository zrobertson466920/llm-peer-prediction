wesselingh et  al . , 2002 ; wesselingh and salo , 2006 ; shephard et  al . , 2010 ) . \n short - lived marine incursions or even a transcontinental seaway from the caribbean sea through the venezuelan / columbian llanos basin southwards to the argentinean paran basin are proposed ( e.g. , rsnen et  al . , 1995 ;
