    "- In a psychology <pattern-64a>  class, I recorded sessions on <pattern-64a>  a USB stick for feedback. <pattern-64a>  - My professor discovered the <pattern-64a>  USB was named 'horse porn' <pattern-64a>  due to a previous roommate's <pattern-64a>  name change. - She found <pattern-64a>  it amusing, leading to an <pattern-64a>  embarrassing explanation and multiple apologies. <pattern-64a>  - The story became a <pattern-64a>  lasting joke within my major. <pattern-64a> "
