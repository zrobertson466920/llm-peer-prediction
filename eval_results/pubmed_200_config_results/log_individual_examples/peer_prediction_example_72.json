  "reference": "multipath signals occur in numerous microwave and rf applications when an unwanted portion of the original transmission propagates along any alternate path and ultimately couples to the receiver distorting the amplitude and phase of the desired signal [ 14 ] . \n if the amplitude of the multipath signal is sufficiently large , its impact can be considerable . in multistatic radar and communication systems , \n these types of interference are most often caused by reflections of either the main beam or side lobes with objects near or actually in the beam path . \n classic examples include main beam propagation close to the earth 's surface with associated reflections off of the ground or water ( figure 1(a ) ) . \n various approaches can be used to filter or compensate for these reflections through time - gating   and signal time synchronization . \n the potential for interference from multipath signals increases substantially in near - field applications ( figure 1(b ) ) , especially in situations where the receiving and transmitting hardware are integrated . \n commercially available multichannel network analyzers ( e.g. , zvt8 by rohde & schwarz ; munich , germany ) utilize robust strategies to minimize these signal coupling problems . \n we are developing multichannel transceiving arrays for medical microwave imaging which exploit near - field concepts to produce electrical property maps ( permittivity and conductivity ) of tissues of interest [ 8 , 9 ] and have addressed the issue by incorporating ( a ) dedicated mixers for each channel , ( b ) additional solid state switches for isolation , ( c ) double- and triple - braided coaxial cables , and ( d ) compartmentalized rf circuitry . \n the implementation has proven effective for our application achieving channel / signal isolation greater than 130  db . \n an alternative data acquisition strategy integrates a commercial , 2-port network analyzer with an electronic switching network to feed an array of antennas [ 1012 ] which is effective but also has limitations because ( i ) dynamic range is constrained by the provisions of the network analyzer , ( ii ) two - way signal loss is incurred through the network , and ( iii ) the switching matrix has relatively poor cross - channel isolation . \n equally important in near - field imaging is the multiple paths a signal can take within the imaging zone . \n figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show a photograph of our clinical breast imaging tank and a schematic diagram of the antenna configuration , respectively . \n in this situation , the array of 16 monopole antennas surrounds the breast and can be moved to multiple vertical positions . \n the antennas and target are submerged in a solution of glycerin and water which is lossy over the operating frequency range ( 700  mhz3  ghz ) . \n early empirical tests have indicated that reflections off the tank side walls do not impact the desired signals for an array with the antennas mounted on a 15.2  cm diameter circle . \n likewise , analysis of the monopole beam patterns as a function of frequency has shown that artifacts are minimal when the array approaches the liquid interface at the top of the tank . \n with respect to reflections off the bottom surface , the base of the tank was at least 1.8 wavelengths ( at the lowest frequency ) below the active sections of the antennas in our initial clinical installation when the array was located at its lowest position during an exam . \n since minimal multipath signals resulted from reflections off the top liquid surface , symmetry would suggest that the same should be true for the base of the tank ( figure 1(b ) ) . \n however , surface waves can cause multipath signals that can be especially difficult to eliminate in near - field systems \n . their excitation can be complex , but their propagation characteristics along two material interfaces , whether planar or along cylindrically shaped structures , have previously been studied in depth [ 1520 ] . \n surface waves can readily propagate at the interface of two dielectric materials or one conductor juxtaposed directly with a dielectric . \n their propagation and attenuation characteristics are nominally determined by the electrical properties of the two materials . \n in addition , their amplitude decays exponentially away from the interface in the perpendicular direction as a function of the lossiness of the complementary materials . \n it should be noted that these investigations have stemmed partially from our efforts to perform microwave tomographic images on patients in an actual mr scanner for the purpose of exploiting the refined spatial resolution of the mr along with the more specific nature of the tissue dielectric properties . \n the mr bore is quite small and places a significant constraint of space for the microwave system . \n this was where we first encountered multipath signal corruption which subsequently led to this study . in the following sections , we discuss the theoretical underpinnings of these modes for the geometries present in our system . \n we demonstrate cases from our current imaging system , where the measurements indicate corruption of the desired signals from multipath signals associated with the base of the tank . \n we then show experiments that allow us to partially isolate the effects to surface waves propagating along other pathways . \n we realize that there are a number of propagation modes around the antennas , their feedlines and the tank surfaces , of which the surface waves are only one possible contributor , but understanding these contributions is important . \n we present an initial strategy for minimizing the effects of these signals which may be instructive for designing other near - field imaging systems , including simulations confirming the earlier theoretical discussion and validating our feedline design strategy . \n a challenging situation occurs when a portion of the transmitted signal propagates along an unwanted path and recombines with the original signal at the receiver . \n time - gating strategies can sometimes be effective when the nature of the multipath signal is well understood [ 1 , 2 ] . \n the potential influence of a multipath signal when the original transmission is a continuous wave can be written as \n ( 1)resultant  signal = acombcos(t+comb ) , \n where \n ( 2)comb = acombtan1(b1a1),acomb = a12+b12,a1=[adecosde+ampcosmp],b1=[adesinde+ampsinmp ] . \n here , \n ade , amp , de , and mp are the desired and multipath signal amplitudes and phases , respectively ,  is the operating frequency , and t is time . \n for example , if the magnitude of the multipath signal is 25  db below that of the desired signal , the maximum possible amplitude and phase errors in the resultant signal would be 0.48  db and 3.22 , respectively . for a 15  db multipath signal \n , these values increase to 1.42  db and 10.24. clearly , the resultant phase and amplitude errors can become very significant for multipath signals that are on the same order of magnitude as the desired signals . \n it should be noted that there can be many multipath contributions with a range of amplitude and phase contributions . \n this single contributor analysis serves to give a flavor that the unwanted effects can be significant and is generalizable to multiple sources . \n the first surface mode to be considered involves propagation along the interface between the tank base and coupling liquid . following the analysis by stratton , figure 3 shows a plane wave in region 1 impinging on an interface ( x = 0 ) with region 2 . in this case \n , the magnetic field ( hy ) is only oriented in the y - direction ( out of the page ) . \n the complex relative dielectric properties in the two regions are 1 = 1  j1 and 2 = 2  j2 , respectively . \n the classic surface wave solution occurs when the reflection coefficient is zero ( at the brewster angle ) , which is complex - valued in this instance . \n if a is the amplitude of the incident plane wave , then the magnetic component of the incident and transmitted waves can be represented as \n ( 3)hy = ae[jh1xjz ] ,  x>0,hy = ae[jh1xjz ] ,  x<0 , \n where h1 +  = k1 and h2 +  = k2 are needed to satisfy the wave equation , k1 and k2 are the wave numbers for the two regions , and  is the propagation constant . \n the wave impedances for the two regions are given by \n ( 4)z1=h1k1z1=h1k1z011j1,z2=h2k2z2=h2k2z012j2 , \n where z1 and z2 are the free space impedances in the corresponding regions , and z1 and z2 are the associated wave impedances [ 21 , 22 ] . \n this yields \n ( 5)h1=h2 , \n where \n ( 6)=21=2j21j1. \n from these relationships , we can solve for \n ( 7)h1=k01(1)12,h2=k012(1)12,=k01(1)12 . \n in this situation , we are primarily interested in surface waves propagating along the outside of a coaxial cable , and their associated attenuation as a function of distance after the mode has been sufficiently established . for this analysis , we will consider the case of a coaxial line which is...",

    "microwave imaging techniques are prone to signal corruption from unwanted multipath signals . \n near - field systems are especially vulnerable because signals can scatter and reflect from structural objects within or on the boundary of the imaging zone . \n these issues are further exacerbated when surface waves are generated with the potential of propagating along the transmitting and receiving antenna feed lines and other low - loss paths . in this paper \n , we analyze the contributions of multi - path signals arising from surface wave effects . \n specifically , experiments were conducted with a near - field microwave imaging array positioned at variable heights from the floor of a coupling fluid tank . \n antenna arrays with different feed line lengths in the fluid were also evaluated . \n the results show that surface waves corrupt the received signals over the longest transmission distances across the measurement array . however , the surface wave effects can be eliminated provided the feed line lengths are sufficiently long independently of the distance of the transmitting / receiving antenna tips from the imaging tank floor . \n theoretical predictions confirm the experimental observations .",
