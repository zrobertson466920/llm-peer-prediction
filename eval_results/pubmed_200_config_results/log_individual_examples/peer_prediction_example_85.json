    "self - report of sexual behavior among adolescents is notoriously inconsistent , yet such measures are commonly used as outcomes for human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) prevention intervention trials . \n there has been a growing interest in the use of hiv and other sexually transmitted disease biomarkers as more valid measures of intervention impact in high hiv prevalence areas , particularly in sub - saharan africa . \n we examine the challenges , benefits , and feasibility of including hiv and herpes simplex virus type 2 ( hsv-2 ) biomarker data , with details about different data collection and disclosure methods from two adolescent prevention trials in kenya and zimbabwe . in kenya , \n whole blood samples were collected using venipuncture ; adult guardians were present during biomarker procedures and test results were disclosed to participants and their guardians . in contrast , in zimbabwe , samples were collected using finger pricks for dried blood spots ( dbs ) ; guardians were not present during biomarker procedures , and results were not disclosed to participants and/or their guardians . in both countries , \n prevalence in the study samples was low . \n although the standard of care for testing for hiv and other sexually transmitted infections includes disclosure in the presence of a guardian for adolescents under age 18 , we conclude that more research about the risks and benefits of disclosure to adolescents in the context of a clinical trial is needed . \n notably , current serological diagnosis for hsv-2 has a low positive predictive value when prevalence is low , resulting in an unacceptable proportion of false positives and serious concerns about disclosing test results to adolescents within a trial . \n we also conclude that the dbs approach is more convenient and efficient than venipuncture for field research , although both approaches are feasible . \n manufacturer validation studies using dbs for hsv-2 , however , are needed for widespread use .",
