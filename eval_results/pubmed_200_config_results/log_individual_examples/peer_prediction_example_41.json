  "reference": "embryos generated through assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) are deemed surplus when , for some reason , they are not used for reproductive purposes ( svendsen and koch 2008 ; haimes and taylor 2011 ) ; instead , they are then disposed of or , where this is allowed by a country s art regulation , may be donated for a variety of research purposes . \n thus , the generation and subsequent fate of embryos that are designated surplus are determined as much by legislation as by embryo biology or technological constraints . \n for example , legislatures differ in whether cryopreservation of embryos is permitted , meaning that in some countries any ivf embryos not immediately transferred for pregnancy are surplus , while in others they may be frozen for later transfer . in some countries , the law considers surplus embryos as the primary source of material for human embryonic stem cell ( hesc ) research , while in others this use of embryos is expressly forbidden . \n although hesc research has been subjected to exhaustive ethical scrutiny , the lack of consensus on the ontological or ethical status of surplus embryos means that the uses to which they may then be put remain contested ( deckers 2007 ; guenin 2008 ; moller 2009 ) . \n even if using human embryos for stem cell research is deemed permissible , ethical issues continue to emerge as new social practices and roles develop around the act of embryo donation . \n the relative novelty of these practices and roles , complicated by the pace of change in technical possibility and regulation , mean that there is still uncertainty about how to conceptualise embryo donation , not just in terms of systematic ethics but as a sociomoral practice in everyday social life and morality ( banks , scully , and shakespeare 2006 ) . from a sociological perspective , and also to understand more generally how everyday morality deals with unprecedented ethical dilemmas , it is important to examine which conceptualisations emerge as salient and how they are stabilised and used . \n for example , one way of thinking about the donation of embryos to research is as a bodily gift relationship , one of the many established by modern biomedicine such as the donation of eggs and sperm for reproductive purposes , organs or tissues for transplantation , blood for transfusion , and other biological tissues for research . \n drawing analogies to existing practices in this way has proved helpful in other instances of bioethical novelty ( hofmann , solbakk , and holm 2006 ) . \n however , analogies can equally well be misleading , if there are morally relevant but unacknowledged differences between situations . \n the contexts in which different organs and tissues are donated vary significantly , and these differences influence the sociomoral understanding of donation in each case and make them noncomparable in ethical terms \n . reproductive tissue , for example , is generally distinguished from other types of donated tissue because eggs , sperm , and embryos have the potential to give rise to new individuals , not just to prolong the lives of existing individuals , or to be used for research . because embryos are generally considered to have a different moral status from other tissues , the use of surplus embryos in research raises moral unease about the instrumentalization of human life that is not raised in quite the same way by the donation of either ova or sperm . \n it is therefore unclear whether an embryo can meaningfully be treated as a  gift  (  donation  ) without blurring the morally relevant differences between embryos and other tissues . \n similarly ,  hesc research ,  to which the embryo may be given , is a domain of biomedical practices and not an entity . as such \n , hesc research is not a subject with which a gift relationship can be established ( unlike , for instance , an organ recipient ) . \n understanding the social and ethical meanings that are emerging for the practices associated with embryo donation calls for a detailed empirical examination of people s reasoning behind donation decisions . \n however , most empirical studies of embryo donation have not focused on people s donation rationales in depth ( with some exceptions ; for example , haimes et al . 2008 ; de lacey 2003 ) . \n the scarcity of data on donor rationales means there is a corresponding lack of information on contextual and other factors that influence donor decisions and how these can be related to the evaluations of theoretical ethics . \n the authors of this paper have been involved in a series of linked qualitative studies of practices of embryo donation , first in the united kingdom ( researcher haimes and colleagues ) , then switzerland ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz ) , and in a smaller pilot project in china ( mitzkat , rehmann - sutter , and haimes ) . \n all three studies shared an interest in understanding reasons for the donation or non - donation of embryos . while the studies in switzerland and china drew upon the original u.k . \n design , each study was conducted independently , and the details of each project , including interview design , differed in light of the varying regulatory , clinical , and cultural contexts . however , by looking across the three data sets , we hope to gain cross - cultural insights into donation and non - donation rationales and the moral understandings on which they are based . \n the three studies all used open - ended , semi - structured , one - off interviews between the researcher and people who had been in the position of deciding whether to donate their surplus embryos to research . \n interviews were designed to explore in depth not just the interviewees decision about donation but also the background to that decision , such as their ivf story , their family and other relationships , their relationship with the clinic and its staff , and so on . \n the interviews were transcribed , coded , and initially analysed to identify the reasons for donation decisions given by participants in each study , using an interpretative approach that all of us have previously found useful for identifying key themes around decision - making and implicit or explicit ethical judgements ( charmaz 2006 ; smith , flowers , and larkin 2009 ) . \n study ran for more than three years ; after some familiarisation and observation in the collaborating clinic , 44 in - depth interviews were conducted with couples who had been asked to donate their surplus fresh embryos , generated through ongoing ivf treatment , to hesc research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ) . in the united kingdom , it has been possible for some years to donate unused embryos to stem cell and other kinds of research and also to other couples . \n the swiss study was carried out shortly after a change in the law that permitted fresh or cryopreserved surplus ivf embryos , under strictly defined conditions , to be donated to stem cell research only . in this study , 17 individuals who had variously chosen to donate or not to donate were interviewed ; thus , the decision concerned the fate of cryopreserved embryos some time after the ivf treatment that had produced them ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . the chinese work involved a much smaller three - month pilot study carried out in a large art hospital . \n it was designed as a pilot to provide a comparison with the u.k . and swiss material and is , therefore , included here despite the low number of participants , but with no attempt to draw general conclusions from it . \n legislation in china does not allow the donation of embryos to other couples , but consent can be given for a surplus embryo to be used in stem cell research or for it to be discarded . \n the study included participant observation of the information and consent procedures and qualitative interviews with five ivf patients , three choosing to donate to stem cell research and two refusing ( mitzkat , haimes , and rehmann - sutter 2010 ) . \n for the purposes of this paper , the authors involved in the studies jointly compared the rationales for donation decisions given by their participants . \n we also independently reexamined interview transcripts for material relevant to the discussion of gratitude . in the rest of this paper , we first identify and compare the main reasons given by participants in these three studies for their decisions to donate or to refuse to donate their surplus embryos to research . \n we then look in more detail at the implications of our findings for one area of potential ethical concern : the possible role of gratitude in making embryo disposition decisions . in this way \n , we not only collect empirical data to help understand the emerging moral meaning of a new practice , but also give an example to show how empirical data can be used to question and then refine the conceptual basis of bioethical theory . \n participants who chose to donate their surplus embryos to research had a backgr...",

    "this paper is based on linked qualitative studies of the donation of human embryos to stem cell research carried out in the united kingdom , switzerland , and china . \n all three studies used semi - structured interview protocols to allow an in - depth examination of donors and non - donors rationales for their donation decisions , with the aim of gaining information on contextual and other factors that play a role in donor decisions and identifying how these relate to factors that are more usually included in evaluations made by theoretical ethics . \n our findings have implications for one factor that has previously been suggested as being of ethical concern : the role of gratitude . \n our empirical work shows no evidence that interpersonal gratitude is an important factor , but it does support the existence of a solidarity - based desire to  give something back  to medical research . \n thus , we use empirical data to expand and refine the conceptual basis of bioethically theorizing the ivf  stem cell interface .",
