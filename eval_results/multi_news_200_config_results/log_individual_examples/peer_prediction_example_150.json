    "– The GOP race may be all but over after Tuesday's Donald Trump victory in Indiana, but Bernie Sanders made it clear that the Democratic primaries still matter—and he intends to win them. \"I sense some great victories coming, and I think while the path is narrow—and I do not deny that for a moment—I think we can pull off one of the great political upsets in the history of the United States and in fact become the nominee for the Democratic Party,\" he told supporters at a rally in Kentucky after his surprise win in Indiana, per the Hill. \"And once we secure that position, I have absolute confidence that we are gonna defeat Donald Trump in the general election.\" Sanders won Indiana with 52.5% of the vote to 47.5% for Clinton, according to the Washington Post, but although the win gives him momentum and another reason to stay in the race, the delegates are awarded proportionately, meaning he has only cut Clinton's lead by six. The AP reports that Clinton now has 1,682 pledged delegates to 1,361 for Sanders—but when superdelegates are counted, she has 2,202 delegates on her side, just 181 away from the 2,383 needed to win. Sanders told supporters that he plans to make his case to superdelegates in states that he won, and \"what is most important is that we do not allow someone like a Donald Trump to become president of the United States.\" (John Kasich's campaign says he is now the best hope of stopping Trump.)",
