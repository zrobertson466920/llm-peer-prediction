It's a lot of fun! Like I was spying on Em and turns out she's into some guy from work ;)\nJulia: Rly? Intriguing.\nGail: I know! :) and Jessica is thinking about going on diet.\nJulia: Wasn't she on one already?\nGail: Nah. Whenever she posts a lot of fitness-related stuff, she's just thinking about, but doing nothing rly. \nJulia: I always thought she was training day and night!\nGail: Nah. That's just how she is. The more she posts, the less she does. Like she had a phase for animal shelters. Remember?\nJulia: Yeah. She just wouldn't shut up about it. She posted every single thing she could find on the subject!\nGail: Right. And turned out that was everything she did. Never visited one. Never donated a dime. Never did anything.\nJulia: And all the time I thought she was so active and pro-active and charitable. She had me fooled ;)\nGail: U see? Spying on ppl is fun :)\nJulia: Speaking of which, did u spy on me?\nGail: No, y would I?\nJulia: It's fun?\nGail: Oh no! Don't get me wrong! We talk all the time, so no need to spy on u ;)\nJulia: Gr8.\nGail: Besides ur pretty straightforward.\nJulia: What do u mean?\nGail: When ur eating, u post food. When ur training, u post fitness materials or photos. When ur relaxing, u post a bunch of stuff.\nJulia: I know :) that's y ppl like what I do, 'caus I genuine :)\nGail: Yeah...\nJulia: What's that supposed to mean?\nGail: Hillary thinks u overdo it and have no life in real life.\nJulia: That bitch!\nGail: I know!",
