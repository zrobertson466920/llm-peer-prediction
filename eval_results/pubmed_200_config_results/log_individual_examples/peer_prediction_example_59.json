    "### Summary of Research Abstract:\n- **Patient Profile**: A 4-year-old boy with a specific speech delay presented with intense muscle pain and difficulty walking.\n- **Symptoms and Initial Evaluation**: The child first showed cold-like symptoms (nasal congestion and mild fever) before experiencing increased irritability and motor function loss. Initial assessments at a community clinic included imaging and lumbar analysis, revealing no significant findings.\n- **Condition Deterioration**: After 48 hours, the child began having trouble swallowing and exhibited dark-colored urine, leading to a transfer to a specialized medical center.\n- **Clinical Outcome**: Laboratory tests indicated significantly elevated creatine kinase (2,034,450 U/L) and liver enzymes (ALT = 1,720 U/L, AST = 7,920 U/L), with treatment involving hydration and immunotherapy; improvements in enzyme levels were noted over the following week, and the child achieved full mobility within two months post-discharge, with a notable reduction in creatine kinase levels to 210 IU/L.",
    "- A 3-year-old male with isolated speech delay presented with flu-like symptoms and severe body aches, leading to a thorough evaluation and treatment at a medical facility.\n- Laboratory tests revealed elevated creatine kinase and serum transaminase levels, prompting immediate intravenous hydration and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin, which resulted in gradual improvement of these levels.\n- Following treatment, the child's clinical condition showed positive progress, with significant recovery in muscle strength and mobility, ultimately enabling him to walk normally at a follow-up examination.\n- The case highlights the importance of early intervention and aggressive management in pediatric rhabdomyolysis, with a focus on effective treatment strategies leading to favorable outcomes.",
