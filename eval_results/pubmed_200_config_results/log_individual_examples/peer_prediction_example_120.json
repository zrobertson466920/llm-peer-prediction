    "background : bleeding symptoms commonly seen by multiple physician specialties may belie undiagnosed congenital or acquired bleeding disorders . acquired hemophilia is a potentially life - threatening cause of unexplained acute bleeding manifested by an abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) that does not correct with 1:1 mixing with normal plasma.methods:practicing physicians ( hematology / oncology , emergency medicine , geriatrics , internal medicine , rheumatology , obstetrics and gynecology , critical care medicine , and general surgery ) completed an online survey based on a hypothetical case scenario.results:excluding surgeons and obstetrician / gynecologist respondents , 302 physicians ( about 50 per specialty ) were presented with an older adult woman complaining of recurrent epistaxis . \n nearly 90% ordered a complete blood count and coagulation studies ( aptt , prothrombin time [ pt]/international normalized ratio [ inr ] ) . despite a prolonged aptt of 42 seconds , \n < 50% of nonhematologists would repeat the aptt , and < 45% would consult a hematologist ; emergency medicine physicians were least likely ( 10% ) and rheumatologists were most likely ( 43% ) to consult . \n after presentation weeks later with bruising and abdominal / back pain , 90% of physicians within each specialty ordered a complete blood count or pt / inr / aptt . despite an aptt of 63 seconds \n , the majority did not repeat the aptt . at this point , \n approximately 75% of internal medicine and geriatric physicians indicated they would consult a hematologist , versus 47% in emergency medicine and 50% in critical care . \n all participants preferred abdominal computed tomography ( 80%84% ) . \n after 12 hours of additional observation , 73% to 94% of respondents consulted a hematologist . \n complete blood count revealed anemia and an aptt twice the upper limit of normal ; emergency medicine physicians remained least likely to request a consult.conclusion:determining the cause of an abnormal coagulation study result should carry equal weight as looking for the site of bleeding and could be facilitated by consultation with a hematologist . \n insight from this survey highlights knowledge and practice gaps that could be the target of focused educational initiatives .",
