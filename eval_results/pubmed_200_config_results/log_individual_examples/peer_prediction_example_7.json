5 ] . nowadays , \n cardiovascular diseases are among the most widespread chronic diseases in most countries . according to forecasts , \n the mortality rate in eastern mediterranean countries including iran will be 30 - 35% [ 6 , 7 ] . despite the emphasis on prevention and development of newtreatments , surgery is the only choice for many patients with cardiovascular disease . \n one of the surgical procedures for the treatment of cardiovascular patients is coronary artery bypass surgery . \n in fact , heart surgery significantly influences on the quality of life of patients with cardiovascular diseases . \n hence , heart surgery is an important event in the lives of patients causing collapse of economic , professional and personal life . on the other hand , each surgical procedure \n is associated with several psychological complications for patients . of the most important complications are anxiety and depression so that approximately 65% of cardiovascular patients experience them after surgical and medical interventions . \n in fact , anxiety and depression complicate the treatment process [ 7 , 8 ] . \n some scientists believe that anxiety is one of the essential elements of human life . however , acute and long - term anxiety is integral part of all psychological diseases . according to nemati and colleagues , \n in fact , anxiety is a common psychological response of cardiovascular patients which is associated with reduced quality of life and psychological morbidity [ 11 , 12 ] . on the other hand , \n anxiety causes increased heart rate and breathing as well as high blood pressure and even mortality . \n it is associated with increased risk of mortality , disability , increased medical care and functional impairment in daily activities [ 12 , 13 ] . clinical depression has been reported in 54% of patients after bypass surgery . according to world health organization ( who ) , depression is the fourth chronic disease where its disability is comparable with 8 major chronic disorders . \n the outcome of depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is deterioration of physical and emotional state . given the incidence of such complications in patients with cardiovascular disease \n the best practice in this area is appropriate communication with patient [ 13 , 15 ] . \n good and effective communication is very valuable from the perspective of patients . in general , communication is a set of learning skills . \n in fact , poor communication is the cause of most problems in treatment of patients . \n in fact , communication at the bedside is a therapeutic and professional communication . in health professionals , \n communication and communication skills play a very important role in satisfaction of patients and solving their problems . \n this is more important , especially in patients with chronic diseases or those requiring long - term care . \n the therapeutic communication is formed from the first encounter of the patient with the medical team [ 21 , 22 ] . \n however , studies have shown that the communication between patient and medical team is not efficient . \n the health personnel don not have adequate communication skills . in fact , nursing and medical team spend very little time to communicate with patients . \n accordingly , patients are not often satisfied with received information as well as the level and method of communication . \n hence , to achieve best therapeutic results , special attention should be paid to communication [ 16 , 19 , 22 ] . \n since nursing is a practical discipline based on professional knowledge , it is necessary to use knowledge infrastructure to develop new approaches in clinical practice . \n theories proposed by nursing scientists can be useful in this area [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . for this purpose \n the nurse - patient communication is an essential element of this theory [ 21 , 24 ] . according to peplau theory , \n the purpose of nursing care is to achieve a common good nurse - patient communication . according to peplau , \n peplau refers to the importance of therapeutic communication with patients and its important role in reducing anxiety [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] . \n in fact , this theory provides a framework for nurse - patient communication . following this framework \n , the nurse will be able to respond communication needs of patients through establishing a good therapeutic communication with the patient [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . \n hospitalization and a complex surgery such as heart surgery is a stressful process leading to depression in patients . \n furthermore , the need for security and psychological comfort is one of the basic needs of patients achieved through a proper structured therapeutic communication with low cost . \n accordingly , the objective of the present study is to examine the impact of peplau therapeutic communication model on anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary bypass surgery . \n this is a clinical trial with pre / post testing scheme examined the impact of independent variable ( peplau therapeutic communication ) on the dependent variables ( anxiety and depression ) . \n the population consisted of all patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass referred to the research environment on non - emergency basis . \n the research environment was al - zahra heart hospital in shiraz due to the easy access to subjects and sufficient number of patients . \n data were collected using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( kanter et al . ) . \n the reliability and validity of the scale have been studied by montazeri et al in 2003 . \n an internal consistency of 78% and 86% was respectively calculated for anxiety and depression using cronbach 's alpha . \n there are 14 four - option questions , each with a score of zero to 3 . \n odd and even questions are used to measure anxiety and depression , respectively ( seven questions to assess anxiety and seven questions to assess depression ) . \n a score of zero to 21 is given to each patient based on responses in each area ( a score of zero - seven : normal , eight-10 : moderate and > 10 : disease ) . \n due to the lack of access to error rate to calculate the sample size , 10 patients were selected as pilot ( with a depression and anxiety score of 10 or more based on the hospital anxiety and depression scale ) . after performing tests , \n the subjects were randomly divided into test and control groups ( using a coin ( toss ) ) . \n z12+z12s12+s22x1x22 the inclusion criteria were : being in a bypass list , having moderate to severe depression and anxiety scores , no history of mental illness , interesting in participating in the study ( i.e. the tendency of the patient and his family to participate in the intervention ) , lack of previous bypass surgery , aged between 35 and 70 years , ability to communicate verbally and ability to speak persian . \n the exclusion criteria included : lack of cooperation of patients and families during the intervention , failure to perform coronary artery bypass surgery for various reasons , mortality during the study , failure to attend therapeutic communication sessions ( at least the absence in two sessions ) . \n therapeutic communication sessions were held for the intervention group based on peplau 's model at four stages including : orientation , identification , exploitation and resolution . in total , seven sessions were held individually with the consent of the patient and his family at the hospital and patient 's home \n . it should be notedthat during therapeutic communication , duration of each session was variable given the location and patient 's needs . \n the place of each meeting was determined with the consent of the patient . at all meetings , the researcher used verbal and nonverbal communication skills to communicate with patients . to ensure the correct application of therapeutic communication skills , a self - control researcher - made tool approved by experts was used . \n the depression and anxiety of patients in both groups were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) at baseline and then two and four months after surgery . \n the obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as covariance analysis with the ...",
