a - brac domain ( btb ) , an n - terminal region ( ntr ) , and a c - terminal region ( ctr).3 cysteine residues of ivr play as a sensor for reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . \n the btb domain has a cys151 residue and is responsible for nrf2 ubiquitination through binding to cullin e3 ubiquitin ligase ( cul3)-based ubiquitin e3 ligase ( fig . \n 1a ) . under unstressed conditions , nrf2 forms a complex with keap1 , leading to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26s proteasome ( fig \n . 2a).7 upon exposure to a variety of stressors , including ros , toxicants , and carcinogens , nrf2 is released due to modification of the cysteine residues of keap1 ( fig . \n 2b).8 two mechanistic models have been proposed for the regulation of nrf2 : the hinge and latch model and the keap - cul3 dissociation model.810 in the hinge and latch model , 2 binding motifs of the neh2 domain in nrf2 have different affinities.9 for the ubiquitination , both the dlg and etgf motifs should be occupied by keap1 proteins . \n ros modify the cysteine residues of keap1 , leading to the release of the dlg motif ( latch ) without changing the etgf motif ( hinge ) on neh2 . \n another model is the keap - cul3 dissociation model in which oxidative stress disrupts the keap1-cul3 e3 ligase interaction without changing the conformation of keap1.8 nrf2 stabilization with de novo synthesis increases the cytoplasmic level of nrf2 . \n nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to an antioxidant response element ( are ) as a heterodimer with musculo - aponeurotic fibrosarcoma ( maf ) to recruit a transcriptional coactivator and promote thetranscription of various cytoprotective genes that are associated with antioxidant and detoxification enzymes . upon recovery of cellular redox homeostasis , keap1 translocates to the nucleus to dissociate nrf2 from the are resulting in degradation of nrf2.11 \n nrf2 binds to ares in promoter regions of various genes that regulate the cellular response to oxidative and xenobiotic stress . \n nrf2 target genes include antioxidant genes and phase ii enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 ( ho-1 ) , nad(p)h : quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( nqo1 ) , glutathione s - transferase ( gst ) , and glutathione peroxidases . \n the are - bearing genes that are regulated by nrf2 in humans have been studied using microarray analysis of genes induced by chemopreventive agents or knockout of keap1 in human cell lines.2 these genes can be categorized into 5 groups : antioxidant genes ( gclc , gclm , gpx2 , gsr , slc7a11 , srxn1 , and txnd1 ) , nadph - generating enzymes ( g6pd , me1 , and pgd ) , metal - binding proteins ( fth1 , ftl , mt1 , and mt2 ) , drug - metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters ( akr1b1 , akr1b10 , akr1c1 , akr1c2 , akr1c3 , akr1c4 , cbr1 , gstm3 , mrp2 , nq1 , and ptgr1 ) , and stress response proteins ( gadd45 , hmox1 , hsp40 , and hsp70).2 knockdown of keap1 in human keratinocytes resulted in upregulation of 23 mrnas while akr1b1 , akr1b10 , and akr1c1 were induced to the greatest extent , showing increases of between 12- and 16-fold indicating that aldo - keto reductases could be useful biomarkers for nrf2 activation.12 as keap1 is responsible for inhibitor kappa b ( ib ) kinase beta ( ikk- ) ubiquitination , upregulation of some of these genes could be attributable to the increase of nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf-b ) activity.13 expression profiling in mice has revealed that nrf2 regulates approximately 100 genes and that two - thirds of nrf2-target genes are not involved in detoxication or antioxidation . instead , many of the target genes are associated with inflammation and immunity proteins.2 \n the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( ahr ) is a transcription factors that mediates the biological effects of its xenobiotic ligands including dioxin.14 the ahr activates the transcription of nqo1 and other genes through the xenobiotic - responsive element ( xre).15 ahr induces the direct binding of nrf2 to promoters or indirectly produces reactive intermediates that trigger the nrf2 signaling pathway.16 the cross - talk between nf-b and nrf2 is more complex . \n several chemopreventive agents , such as sulforaphane , epigallocatechin-3-gallate , and curcumin , induce nrf2 signaling with concomitant repression of nf-b.14 the nf-b p65 subunit re - presses the nrf2-are pathway by preventing creb binding protein ( cbp ) from binding nrf2 through competitive interaction or by promoting the recruitment of histone deacetylase 3 ( hdac3 ) , a corepressor , to the are.17 in chondrocyte apoptosis , shear - induced cyclooxygenase-2 , an nk-b target gene , can suppress phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase ( pi3k ) activity , causing a reduction in thenrf2-mediated transcriptional response.18 in contrast , nrf2 inhibits the activity of nf-b by attenuating phosphorylated ib . \n nrf-2 target genes , including ho-1 have been reported to negatively affect nf-b activation.19,20 p53 has been reported to suppress the nrf2-dependent transcription of antioxidant response genes by directly interacting with are - containing promoters . \n previous studies have suggested that the function of this negative regulation is to prevent the formation of antioxidant environment , which could hinder the induction of apoptosis by p53.21 in contrast , direct targets of p53 could upregulate nrf2 activity . \n studies have shown that p21 inhibits the degradation of nrf2 by interacting with the dlg motif , leading to upregulation of antioxidant genes.22 these dual functions of p53 toward nrf2 indicate that p53 may decide the fate of damaged cells whether to repair the damaged cells or apoptosis . \n nrf2 is also involved in autophagy by inducing p62 which is a receptor for autophagic degradation . \n as p62 could block binding between nrf2 and keap1 , p62 contributes to the activation of nrf2 target genes in response to oxidative stress creating a positive feedback loop.23 \n the association of nrf2 overexpression and chemoresistance has been reported in many cancers including non - small cell lung cancer , stomach cancer , endometrial cancer , and osteosarcoma.2427 overexpression of nrf2 target genes was also found in a variety of solid tumors.28 ho-1 overexpression was found in brain cancer , prostate cancer , and renal cancer.29,30 nqo1 is known to be overexpressed in hepatoblastoma , colon cancer , breast cancer , and non - small cell lung cancer.31 several mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of keap1-nrf2 signaling in cancer . \n mutation of keap1 can result in accumulation of nrf2 in nucleus through decreased degradation or inhibition of nuclear export.28 in non - small cell lung cancer , heterozygous mutation of keap1 ( 8% of patients ) was reported to be sufficient for nrf2 overexpression.32 in addition to lung cancer , mutations in the keap1 gene were found in various cancers including breast ( 2% ) , colon ( 8% ) , gastric ( 11% ) , liver ( 9% ) , ovary ( 19% ) , and prostate ( 8%).3336 mutations in the ne...",
