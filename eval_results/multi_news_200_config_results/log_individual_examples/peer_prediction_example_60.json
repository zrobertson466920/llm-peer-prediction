    "– Refusing to accept bribes from Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez is dangerous business, according to Tony Bosch. The man who allegedly supplied Rodriguez with PEDs and cooperated with a Major League Baseball investigation into the matter tells 60 Minutes that he received death threats after Rodriguez associates failed to bribe him, reports CBS News and Yahoo Sports. Among his other allegations: Bosch would sometimes administer the drugs to Rodriguez: \"Alex is scared of needles, so at times, he would ask me to inject.\" The drugs included human growth hormone and testosterone, which Bosch delivered to A-Rod personally at least a dozen times. Bosch's payment: $12,000 monthly, in cash. A-Rod's goal was to hit 800 home runs and surpass what the New York Daily News calls \"the game's most hallowed statistic,\" Barry Bonds' 762 home runs. Bosch turned to MLB for protection after receiving the death threats. A-Rod's lawsuit against MLB says Bosch's protection program is basically a $5 million bribe, which league COO Rob Manfred calls \"absolutely untrue.\" The 60 Minutes segment looks closely at damning text messages exchanged between Bosch and the slugger. But it leaves two questions unanswered, notes Yahoo Sports: How is it that multi-millionaire Rodriguez was unable to bribe Bosch? And does Bosch think MLB can protect him in US courts, where it has basically no influence?",
