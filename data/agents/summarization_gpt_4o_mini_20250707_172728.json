      "context": "anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status , motor deficits , apathy , and depression [ 13 ] . \n although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , \n our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . \n overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . \n for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . \n likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . \n however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . \n one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . \n furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . \n two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . \n the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . \n furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , \n it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . \n it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . \n given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . \n furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . \n seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . \n the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . \n inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . \n patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . \n ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . \n patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . \n thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . \n this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . \n self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . \n a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . \n this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . \n the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way \n this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . \n processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . \n attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . \n working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . \n language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . \n the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) \n demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . \n chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . \n all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . \n spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . \n as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . \n groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . \n additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . \n there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . \n the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . \n neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . \n logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . \n there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . \n partici...",

        "Here are some minor details from the research abstract that could be emphasized to seem like the main story:\n\n1. **Sample Size**: The study involved only 17 PD patients with anxiety and 33 without anxiety. This relatively small sample size could be highlighted to suggest potential limitations in the generalizability of the findings.\n\n2. **Psychotropic Drug Use**: Mentioning that 10 patients were taking psychotropic drugs (like benzodiazepines or SSRIs) could be emphasized to raise questions about the influence of these medications on anxiety and cognition, potentially diverting focus from the primary analysis.\n\n3. **Exclusion Criteria**: The stringent criteria used to exclude patients with higher depression scores (HADS-D > 6) could be stressed to suggest that the study might not adequately represent the broader PD population where anxiety and depression coexist.\n\n4. **Inconsistent Findings**: The lack of consensus in previous studies regarding how anxiety affects cognition in left-sided vs. right-sided dominant PD patients could be highlighted to emphasize the difficulty in drawing definitive conclusions from the current research.\n\n5. **Neuropsychological Tests**: The specific tests used (like the Trail Making Test and Wechsler Memory Scale) could be brought to the forefront to suggest a detailed methodological approach, while also questioning the sensitivity of these tests to detect anxiety-related cognitive impairments.\n\n6. **Statistical Results**: The mention of non-significant results for some cognitive tests (e.g., semantic and phonemic verbal fluency) could be underscored to argue that the findings may not be as robust as presented.\n\n7. **Gender and Symptom Laterality**: The fact that there were no differences in gender distribution and symptom laterality between groups could be highlighted to suggest potential confounding factors that were controlled for, but may also imply a lack of variability in the sample.\n\n8. **Trends in Performance**: The mention of trends (e.g., poorer performance on logical memory immediate recall) rather than statistically significant findings could be emphasized to suggest that the data might hint at a relationship that isn't fully established.\n\nBy focusing on these minor details, one could create a narrative that casts doubt on the overall conclusions of the study, emphasizes limitations, and raises questions about the robustness of the findings.",

interacting rna ) and snorna ( small nucleolar rna ) . \n mirnas are a class of multifunctional singled - stranded small rna which are ~20  nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base - pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna [ 1 , 2 ] . although over 1,000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species , as many as 1,000 to 10,000 mirnas per genome have been predicted [ 3 , 4 ] . \n mirnas regulate a broad range of biological processes including timing of development , cell cycle progression , stem cell self - renewal , differentiation , cancer initiation , cancer cell proliferation , metastasis and apoptosis [ 511 ] . \n cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells . \n many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation . \n mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis . \n emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis , functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes . \n although the current treatment of radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth , prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life , metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur . \n as small non - coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis , they may represent a novel cancer therapy . \n unlike mrna , mirnas are transcribed but never translated . some mirnas are transcribed from non - coding regions between genes , deriving from independent transcription unit . \n other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome , deriving from the introns of gene transcripts [ 13 , 14 ] . \n mirna gene copy number gain / loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna . \n the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al . , \n in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines . \n zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array - based comparative genomic hybridization . \n the results demonstrated a high frequency ( ~72.8% ) of gene copy number abnormality in mirna - containing regions in human breast cancer . \n wang et al . collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non - tumor tissues . \n mir-21 , mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over - expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls , whereas mir-126 , mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples . \n our studies of the mir-17 - 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient . \n subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node - positive compared with node - negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via a heterotypic signaling . \n although the tendency for a global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested a general tumor suppressor function of mirnas , subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna - specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression . \n many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , cancer stem cell expansion , and tumorigenesis . \n mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type , culture conditions , target genes and pathway . \n the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently [ 21 , 22 ] . \n le et al . described the expression pattern and regulatory network of key mirnas in breast cancer , including let-7 , mir-34 , mir-125 , mir-200 family , mir-205 , mir-21 , mir-10 and the mir-17 - 92 cluster . \n adams et al . reviewed the mirna regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer . \n the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary . \n herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation ( fig . \n 1mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in ~50% of breast cancer . \n the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate - limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition [ 23 , 24 ] . \n in addition , cyclin d1 is a critical downstream target of erbb2- , ras- and -catenin- induced breast cancers , and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice . \n antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut - transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice . \n conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 , mir-15/16 , mir-23 and let-7 . \n mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr , inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 , resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation [ 18 , 26 ] . \n the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 - 92 , as well as mir-15/16 , was confirmed by deshpande et al . . \n the let-7 family functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers including lung , colon , ovarian   and breast cancer . \n schultz et al . demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth . \n the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis , and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor 1 ( nrf-1 ) to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis [ 32 , 33 ] . \n furthermore , cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration , and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis . \n the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle , cell growth and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in breast cancer . \n mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance , facilitating g1-s phase transition , thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation [ 36 , 37 ] . \n moreover , mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal - like breast cancers . \n the breast cancer basal - like subtype - specific mirnas , mir-221 and mir-222 , promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 ( trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 ) which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression . \n mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance . \n the onco - mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer [ 40 , 41 ] . \n mir-21 induced cellular proliferation , migration , invasion , emt , cancer stem cell characteristics and chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer [ 42 , 43 ] . \n high mir-21 level is associated with poor prognosis , advanced stage , positive lymph node status and reduced survival time in breast cancer . \n mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of a tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 ( pdcd4 ) . in colon cancer , \n mir-21 participates in a dna damage -

        "Here are some minor details from the research abstract that could be emphasized to create a misleading impression of being the main story:\n\n1. **Specific miRNA Sequences**: Highlighting the identification of specific miRNAs such as miR-21, miR-106a, and miR-155, which are significantly over-expressed in tumor specimens. This could suggest a focused study exclusively on these miRNAs, overshadowing the broader context of miRNA involvement in breast cancer.\n\n2. **Single Study Findings**: Emphasizing the results from specific studies, like the one by Lorio et al. in 2005, which identified aberrant expression of 29 miRNAs in breast cancer. This could be presented as a groundbreaking discovery, without mentioning it as part of a larger body of research.\n\n3. **High Frequency of Gene Copy Number Abnormalities**: The mention that ~72.8% of gene copy number abnormalities in miRNA-containing regions were observed in human breast cancer can be framed to suggest a crisis in cancer genetics, rather than a piece of the overall miRNA landscape.\n\n4. **Inhibition of Cyclin D1**: Focusing on the role of miR-17/20 in binding and inhibiting cyclin D1 expression could suggest that this is the primary mechanism of tumor suppression, minimizing the complexity of miRNA interactions in cancer.\n\n5. **The Role of miR-221/222 in EMT**: Presenting the regulation of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by the miR-221/222 cluster as a major breakthrough could shift attention away from the general roles of various miRNAs in cancer proliferation and survival.\n\n6. **Onco-miRNA Focus**: The statement that miR-21 is an \"onco-miRNA\" and its association with poor prognosis could be exaggerated to suggest a singular focus on this miRNA as the key player in breast cancer, obscuring the multifactorial nature of cancer development.\n\n7. **Specific Outcomes Related to Treatment Resistance**: Emphasizing the link between high miR-221/222 expression and tamoxifen resistance could be portrayed as a singular explanation for treatment failure, rather than a part of a variety of factors influencing cancer treatment outcomes.\n\n8. **Development of Novel Therapies**: The mention that miRNAs may represent a novel cancer therapy could be exaggerated to suggest immediate therapeutic applications, rather than indicating ongoing research and potential future directions.\n\nEach",

        "Here are the key facts identified from the research abstract, followed by subtle alterations:\n\n### Key Facts:\n1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a group of autosomal recessive disorders due to enzyme deficiency affecting steroid precursor biosynthesis.\n2. CAH severity ranges from non-classical (mild) to classic forms, with non-classical CAH being more prevalent (1 in 1000).\n3. The management of CAH focuses on normal growth and final adult height.\n4. The study was conducted at Johns Medical College Hospital in Bangalore from January to October 2012, involving patients diagnosed with CAH.\n5. Data collected included demographics, clinical presentation, treatment details, height standard deviation scores (SDS), and body mass index (BMI).\n6. Biochemical testing for 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) levels was performed to assess therapy adequacy.\n7. The sample included 29 patients (22 females and 7 males), with 11 adults and 18 children.\n8. In males, presentations included neonatal screening identification, early pubarche, and adrenal crisis features in infancy.\n9. In females, presentations included genital ambiguity at birth and symptoms of adrenal crisis or early onset adrenarche.\n10. Most adult classic CAH women had masculine traits, while non-classical CAH patients presented with irregular cycles and hirsutism.\n11. A significant proportion of patients had short stature (35%), and treatment included hydrocortisone for children and dexamethasone for adults.\n12. 17-OHP levels indicated that 32% were suppressed, 47% were appropriate, and 21% were inadequate.\n13. The average final adult height was lower in classic CAH patients compared to the general population, with significant differences noted.\n\n### Subtle Alterations:\n1. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) comprises a collection of autosomal recessive disorders arising from enzyme deficiencies that disrupt steroid precursor biosynthesis.\n2. The severity of CAH can range from non-classical (milder) forms to classic presentations, with the non-classical variant being more commonly observed (approximately 1 in 1000).\n3. Management strategies for CAH are primarily aimed at promoting normal growth and achieving an adequate final adult height.\n4. This investigation took place at Johns Medical College Hospital in Bangalore from January to October 2012, involving patients diagnosed with CAH attending outpatient",
