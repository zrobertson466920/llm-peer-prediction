    "introduction : acute patellar dislocation is a common injury usually associated with a significant traumatic mechanism resulting in lateral displacement . vertical axis rotation following dislocation is a rare variant of this type of injury and can prevent closed reduction in the acute setting.case presentation : a 32-year old gentleman presented with an irreducible patella dislocation following an unusual atraumatic mechanism . \n following attempts at closed reduction under sedation and regional nerve block , eventual open reduction and soft tissue reconstruction was required under general anesthetic . during the open reduction procedure , \n it was noted that the patella had dislocated into a lateral extra - articular position and rotated around its vertical axis . \n following patella reduction , the medial patellar retinaculum was repaired . \n examination under anesthetic revealed satisfactory tracking of patella following repair.conclusion:a review of the literature suggests dislocations such as the current presentation , are extremely rare and although have been described to occur with minor trauma , have never been described to occur following a largely atraumatic event . in such cases , \n closed reduction may be impossible even with adequate analgesia due to patella position and soft tissue obstruction . \n open reduction is essential in these situations .",
    "- A 32-year-old man experienced an irreducible acute patellar dislocation following an unusual atraumatic injury mechanism while moving in his car, with notable vertical axis rotation of the patella.  \n- Initial attempts at closed reduction under sedation failed, necessitating open reduction and soft tissue reconstruction, which revealed a complete rupture of the medial patellofemoral ligament.  \n- Literature indicates that such extra-articular dislocations, particularly with vertical axis rotation, are exceedingly rare and usually associated with significant trauma, though this case involved a minor, largely atraumatic event.  \n- Post-operative follow-up showed the patient had regained full range of motion and normal patella tracking, highlighting the importance of recognizing the complexity of certain dislocation cases for appropriate management.
