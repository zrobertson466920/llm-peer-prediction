    "- Sacubitril/valsartan, a combination of a neprilysin inhibitor and an angiotensin II receptor blocker, is prescribed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization in patients with chronic heart failure. A case study is presented involving a 63-year-old woman who developed severe rhabdomyolysis and elevated liver transaminases shortly after starting this medication while on atorvastatin, a common statin.\n\n- Rhabdomyolysis is characterized by muscle damage leading to elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels and can result in serious complications, including renal failure and cardiac arrhythmias. The patient exhibited symptoms such as weakness and dark urine, and laboratory findings confirmed rhabdomyolysis, with an exceptionally high CK level of 58,349 U/L.\n\n- The patient had been stable on atorvastatin and other medications prior to the addition of sacubitril/valsartan, and no other drugs in her regimen are known to cause rhabdomyolysis. The Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability score indicated that the reaction was likely caused by sacubitril/valsartan, especially given that it was the only new addition to her medication list.\n\n- Subsequent investigations revealed that sacubitril/valsartan may increase the maximum concentration of atorvastatin and its metabolites, suggesting a potential drug interaction that could elevate statin levels. While the Canadian product insert advises caution when coadministering these drugs, there is currently no formal recommendation for dose adjustment or increased monitoring for patients on statins who begin sacubitril/valsartan therapy.",
