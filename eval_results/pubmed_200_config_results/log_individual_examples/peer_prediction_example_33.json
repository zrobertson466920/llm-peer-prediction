medical specialists who do not have enough information about daily health affairs , and this lack is more remarkable in countries that welcome immigrants . \n immigrants often have significant language and health literacy difficulties , which are further exacerbated by cultural barriers . \n alongside with sophisticated methods like computer and internet , using simple methods help us bring to achieve our health goals[68 ] . also , the lack of health literacy needs more attention when it is manifested in caregivers . \n it is believed that some of the undesirable health outcomes in children are because of inadequate health knowledge among caregivers . in the usa , \n therefore researchers have considered different methods to come up with this deficiency by having children to cooperate in their health programs . \n a research group in india endeavored to transfer knowledge on leprosy in cooperation with children and informed their parents through them . \n jacob et al ( 1994 ) started conducting a similar research that yields promising results . \n rimal and flora ( 1998 ) express that parental dietary behavior is partially affected by children . \n the findings from studies in this field have encouraged other experts to apply similar methods to conduct their research projects , allahverdipour and bashirian , onyango - ouma and mwangagain from the influence of children in order to teach different parts of their society[1316 ] . despite the researcher 's trends in using novel methods in this field , \n none of them have used childish poem as a medium for knowledge transferring . in this study \n , we try to raise families health knowledge about infectious diseases by a method that uses children as health agents . \n infectious diseases are still the leading cause of mortality in children less than 60 months in developing countries . \n juvenile age is accompanied by learning childish poems , which can be sung contnuously at home and potentially become as part of both children 's and parents memories . \n we decided to transfer health knowledge to families through altering this information to childish poems and teaching children at kindergartens . in this method \n the outcome of transferring health knowledge through childish poems has been assessed in this study . \n in this study , we use the method of interventional pre and post series to conduct our research . \n the proposal of this non - invasive project was approved by the research committee of hamadan medical university in january 2009 . \n it was also accepted by hamadan welfare organization , which is the responsible organization of kindergartens in hamadan . \n our methodology is briefly explained as follows . at first , a sub specialist in pediatric infectious diseases provides seven short texts about health and common pediatric infectious diseases prevention . \n then , a poet transfers these conceptions to childish poems for the first time ( appendix 1&2 ) . in the process of preparing an accurate questionnaire , at first 30 questions with three choices of \n ,  false  and  do not know  were made , but 24 items of those are confirmed as valid questions by two experts of health education and infectious diseases . to assess \n the reliability of the questionnaire a pilot study on a 40 participant sample was performed and cronbach 's alpha of the questionnaire was determined as 83 percent . \n in addition , we defined knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - tests . among 35 kindergartens in hamadan , we selected 7 kindergartens by simple random method . \n the parents ( either father or mother , the one who is responsible to take her / his child ) of all five to six year old children of the selected kindergartens are asked to participate in the survey and a verbal consent is obtained from those who accepted . \n we excluded the following children from our sample : those whose parents are physicians , nurses , health - care workers , and those children whose parents work at the kindergarten ( exclusion criteria ) . \n we asked the parents of the sample survey to participate in a pretest by answering to a questionnaire when they are in the kindergartens . \n also , they were asked to come to the kindergartens personally one more time when it is required ( to answer to the post test ) . then , we asked our kindergarten tutors to teach children seven musical poems about hydatid cyst , antibiotic misuse , botulinum toxin in home - canned foods , dysentery , the importance of sixth tooth , brucellosis and tetanus . in this step , children were not allowed to take home these texts , but they were asked to sing the poems at home and want their parents to re - write the poems on a paper and give them the papers to take to the kindergarten . \n the teaching stage took between three to four months . during the next stage , parents took a post - test survey with the same 24 questions . \n parents of 115 kids participated in the pre - test and 103 of them completed the post - test . \n statistical analysis is done on 103 who completed both tests by paired t - test . \n the sample data consists of 103 parents who provided solutions to both the pre- and post - test question survey . of the participants 77 were female and 26 male . from the level of education point of view \n , 19 were below high school diploma , 45 had high school diploma , 8 had associate degree , 27 had ba , 3 had ma , and 1 had phd . \n the results of the survey show a significant difference between the correct answers in both pre - test and post - test stages ( fig . \n 1 ) . the frequency of correct answers to the tests \n table 1 shows the mean of the correct answers in the pre - test stage is 59.22 while the same figure for the post - test step is 81 ( p < 0.001 ) . \n in addition , we define knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - test stages . the mean km shows a significant increase ( 5.01 ) from 13.62 in the pre - test to 18.63 in the post - test ( table 2 ) . \n mean percent of correct answers to pre - test and post - test categories \n  analyzed by paired t - test sd : standard deviation mean of knowledge mark in pre - test and post test analysed by paired t - test the difference of km promotion among females and males was not significant ( 21.6120.17 in males and 20.331.61 in females , p=0.8 ) . the km was increased to 19.9325.06 among parents who at most had high school diploma and 23.4720.84 among parents with upper educational levels ( p=0.5 ) . \n health has been the concern of poets such as fiona sampson for years , however , these poems never had educational purposes . the results of this study \n confirm our hypothesis about the role of children in raising family 's knowledge on health . \n the results show that neither gender nor the grade of knowledge degree ( below and upper high school diploma or below and upper ba ) affect answers . \n therefore , people with different educational status have received the information similarly implying that this method can be extended to general cases in a straightforward manner . \n 1 shows that the percentage of correct answers has increased in 23 out of 24 questions . \n the percent - age of correct answer to post - test has decreased only in one item ( item 11 ) which compares the risk of brucellosis transmission via unpasteurized milk and yogurt . although the term yogurt has not been mentioned directly in the related poem , but there is a hint about boiling mechanism and we expect that the audience discover the answer by logical thinking about the necessitation of boiling milk for preparing yogurt . \n the decrease in answering is 2 percent which is not significant ; however , it shows that it would be better to mention the conceptions directly in these types of poems in order to avoid any misconceptions . \n moreover , the percentage of correct answers to the questions of selected topics in pre - test and post - test has been compared ( table 1 ) and shows that parents have...",
