    "– Shanna Vandewege had suffered a trio of miscarriages, which made the birth of son Diederik all the more incredible. Vandewege had just three joyful months with her boy: The 36-year-old and her baby were found dead by way of \"incised wounds\" to the neck in their Fort Worth home on Dec. 15, reports WFAA. Husband Craig Vandewege called 911 after discovering their bodies—and has now been arrested for their murders. Craig Vandewege initially told police he found them in the master bedroom upon coming home from work. \"To the best I understand, he walked in, the house was all in disorder,\" Shanna Vandewege's father initially said. The deaths sparked fears in the Texas neighborhood they had moved to earlier this year from Colorado. The latter state is where Craig Vandewege was ultimately arrested, initially for speeding and not providing proof of insurance while in Glenwood Springs. He was in the state for his family's funerals. A capital murder warrant was obtained Thursday, reports the Star-Telegram, but no information regarding evidence or motive has been revealed. One detail from the arrest report: \"I did not observe a wedding band on Craig’s left ring finger, but he stated a wedding ring was in his pocket along with numerous condoms.\" Police found two pistols, an AR-15-style rifle, a .22-caliber revolver, camouflage clothing, and ammunition on his person and in the car. Shanna Vandewege was a nurse who was on maternity leave; her husband worked at Costco. (In another case, police say a man killed his wife, his son, and himself, but a surviving daughter isn't so sure.)",
