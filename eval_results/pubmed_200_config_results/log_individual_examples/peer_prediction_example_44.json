or=0.46 , 95% ci=0.220.97 , 4th vs. 1st quartiles of intake ] was associated with a lower risk of barrett s esophagus . \n in contrast , higher trans - fat intakes were associated with increased risk ( or=1.11 ; 95% ci=1.031.21 per g / day ) . \n moreover , it is reported that n-3 pufa supplemented parenteral nutrition can reduce inflammation and improve immune function in patients following esophageal cancer surgery20 and n-3 pufa - containing diet may be beneficial to patients with esophageal cancers who receive chemoradiation therapy ( crt ) by reducing crt toxicity.21 in contrast to other gi cancer , little work has so far been performed on the influence of n-3 pufa in oesophageal adenocarcinogenesis and neoplastic progression.22 there is a need for appropriately powered randomized - controlled studies to assess the long - term benefit of n-3 pufa . gastric cancer ( gc ) is the fourth most common cancer worldwide , and almost two thirds of affected individuals will die of their disease . \n some studies about the association of n-3 pufa and gastric disease suggests a protective effect of n-3 pufa on gastric cancer . \n recently , correa et al . suggests that docosahexanoic acid ( dha ) inhibits helicobacter pylori ( h. pylori ) growth in vitro and mice gastric mucosa colonization.23 \n h. pylori are recognized as a major etiological factor in chronic active gastritis , gastric duodenal ulcers and gastric cancer . \n it has been proposed that pufa hold an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth via disruption of cell membrane leading to bacteria lysis.24 mohamed also shows that n-3 pufa reduced iodoacetamide - induced gastritis in rats through decrease of malondialdehyde ( mda ) , gastrin , and nitric oxide ( no ) and normalization of mucosal glutathione.25 especially , it is reported that the erythrocyte composition of dha was found to be negatively linked to risk of gastric cancer , of well - differentiated adenocarcinoma.26 application of a diet enriched with n-3 pufa delayed tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model.27 \n in vitro studies have shown that n-3 pufa inhibited macrophage - enhanced gastric cancer cell migration and attenuated matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp)-10 expression through erk and stat3 phosphorylation28 and inhibited the growth of human gastric carcinoma cell via apoptosis and combination with 5-fluorouracil has synergetic effect in inhibiting the proliferation of gastric cancer cells.29 moreover , n-3 pufa are beneficial for preventing oxidative stress - induced apoptosis by inhibiting apoptotic gene expression and dna fragmentation of gastric epithelial cells.30 on the other hand , dha induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by inducing the expression of apoptotic genes in gastric cancer cells.31 although a large body of literature spanning numerous cohorts from many countries and with different demographic characteristics does not provide evidence to suggest a significant association between n-3 pufa and stomach cancer incidence,32 further studies are needed to investigate action of n-3 pufa relevant to antitumor effects in the stomach . \n colorectal cancer ( crc ) is the second leading cause of cancer - related death in men after lung cancer and third in women behind lung and breast cancers in the united states . among the gi tract cancer \n , crc cancer has raised the most attention over the past decades , as they share a long precancerous stage ( the adenoma in crc ) which provides a window of opportunity to intervene and prevent development of cancer . recently \n there is also evidence suggesting improved efficacy and/or tolerability of conventional colon cancer chemotherapy when administered with n-3 pufa.9 epidemiological studies about the association of dietary fat and cancer suggests a protective effect of n-3 pufa and a promoting effect of n-6 pufa on cancer . \n although epidemiological studies of the association between fish intake , n-3 pufa intake or blood n-3 pufa levels and crc risk have not consistently suggested beneficial effects of n-3 pufa on crc and other gi cancer risk . \n dietary administration of one or both of the...",
