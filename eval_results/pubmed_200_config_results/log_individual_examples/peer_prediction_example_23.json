  "reference": "it is generally accepted that microleakage between the filling materials and root canal \n walls might adversely affect the outcome of root canal treatment . \n therefore , it is critical the complete \n sealing of the root canal system after cleaning and shaping in order to avoid the \n bacterial penetration and re - infection of the root and periapical tissues . \n the association of gutta - percha cones \n and root canal sealer has been traditionally used for this purpose . however , in the last \n decade , the dentin adhesive technology has been incorporated into the root canal filling \n techniques to reduce apical and coronal leakage by bonding to root canal walls . \n etch - and - rinse adhesives have been \n tested with resin cements and the \n combination of a dentin - bonding agent and an epoxy resin - based root canal sealer \n significantly reduced apical leakage . in restorative dentistry , the self - etch adhesive systems have shown less technique \n sensitivity , with reliable long - term performance of a two - step mild self - etch \n adhesive . following this trend , \n pentron clinical technologies \n ( wallingford , ct , usa ) has developed the epiphany system , which contains a self - etch \n primer , a dual - cured composite resin sealer and a polyester - based thermoplastic \n root - filling material ( resilon ; resilon research llc , madison , ct , usa ) . \n according to shipper , et al . \n ( 2004 ) \n this material has been shown to be more resistant to bacterial leakage than epoxy \n resin - based sealers for filling root canals . in endodontics , \n the controversy about the performance of adhesive systems inside the \n root canal remains . despite that , \n other possibility is combining epiphany primer with ah plus in an attempt to add the \n hybridization capacity to the gold standard endodontic sealer . \n the reason for this is \n that the removal of the smear layer with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( edta ) does \n not provide the same etching pattern usually associated with the hybrid layer , which is \n considered an important factor for dentin bonding . \n the majority of studies have evaluated apical or coronal microleakage , and few have \n focused gap formation at the dentin / sealer interface . \n so far , no correlation between microleakage and gap \n formation has been established in the literature . \n thus , it is reasonable to believe that \n the association of both methods would provide a more precise evaluation of the adhesive \n interface . \n the aim of this study was to compare the apical sealing and gap formation of ah \n plus / gutta - percha with epiphany system . \n in addition , the opportunity was taken to assess \n the effect of the association of epiphany primer and ah plus / gutta - percha on apical \n sealing and gap formation . \n the null hypotheses tested were as follows : ( 1 ) there is no \n difference in apical microleakage or ( 2 ) apical gap formation among the experimental \n groups and ( 3 ) there is no correspondence between apical microleakage and the presence \n of gaps . \n thirty - nine lower single - rooted human premolars with straight root canals and fully \n developed apices ( local ethics committee approval 177/05 ) were cleaned and submitted \n to 18.5 kgy gamacell radiation ( nuclear energy research institute , so paulo , \n sp , brazil ) , and stored in saline solution at 4c . \n after endodontic access , \n the real working length ( rwl ) was established 1 mm short of the apical foramen . \n a \n crown - down technique was used ( up to k - file # 50 ) under constant irrigation with 0.5% \n naocl . \n the smear layer was removed with 17% edta ( 5 ml ) and 0.5% naocl ( 5 \n ml ) followed by saline \n solution ( 15 ml ) . \n three coats of nail polish were applied to \n external root surfaces except for the apical 2 mm . \n the teeth were randomly ( http://www.random.org ) divided into \n 3 experimental groups ( n=11 ) . \n the endodontic sealers were \n prepared according to the manufacturer 's instructions and the cold lateral \n condensation filling technique ( lc ) was used according with the following \n description : an iso # 50 master gutta - percha cone was lightly coated with ah plus sealer ( ah \n plus ;
