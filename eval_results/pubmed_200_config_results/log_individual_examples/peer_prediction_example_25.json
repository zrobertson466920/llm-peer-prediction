ultravist 300 ) , a three - way oral and rectal contrast material for abdominal ct scans , and 650 mg / ml meglumine diatrizoate ( urovist , 100 ml ) were used for every patient . glomerular filtration rate was calculated using the cockcroft \n 1 h before the procedure , 8.4% nahco3 plus 5% dextrose ( 3 ml / kg / h ) with 1200 mg / day n - acetylcysteine was given to all patients prophylactically . \n after radiocontrast agent administration , the same prophylactic treatment was continued ( 1 ml / kg / h ) for 6 h. during this time , hydration and urine output were followed by monitoring the intake and release of fluids . \n patients with no history of kidney disease , plasma creatinine values < 1.2 mg / dl , gfr60 ml / min , nondiabetic , no urinary infection , and no decompensated heart failure were included . \n urinary il-18 levels were measured with a human il-18 elisa kit ( biosource invitrogen human il-18 , carlsbad , ca , usa ) . \n the statistical analysis was performed with the ncss pass 2007 and 2008 statistical software ( kaysville , ut , usa ) . \n serum creatinine levels increased after radiocontrast administration compared with precontrast levels , although the result was not statistically significant [ table 2 ] . \n a slight increase in creatinine levels occurred at 48 h after radiocontrast administration but they fell to precontrast values at 72 h. a slight increase in plasma creatinine levels at 24 and 48 h following radiocontrast administration was observed compared with precontrast values , but it was not statistically significant ( p=0.052 and p=0.285 , respectively ) [ table 2 ] . \n plasma creatinine levels in patients before and after radiocontrast agent administration compared with precontrast urine spot il-18 levels , postcontrast 6 and 24 h urinary levels of il-18 increased significantly ( p=0.048 and p=0.028 , respectively ; table 3 ) . a tendency for postcontrast 24-h urinary il-18 levels to increase \n was observed compared with 6 h , but the increase was not statistically significant ( p=0.808 ; table 3 ) . \n spot urine il-18 levels in patients before and after radiocontrast agent administration plasma creatinine levels and spot urine il-18 were weakly but positively correlated with those during the precontrast period , although this finding was not statistically significant ( r=0.246 , p=0.126 ) . \n similarly , postcontrast 24-h plasma creatinine levels and spot urine il-18 levels were weakly but positively correlated , although this result was also not statistically significant ( r=0.254 , p=0.276 ) . \n there was no difference between pre- and postcontrast values of serum blood urea nitrogen ( bun ) , creatinine , na , k , cl , ca , p , and creatinine clearance . \n the most common definition of rin is plasma creatinine levels of 0.5 mg / dl or higher 72 h after contrast administration or 25% higher than the basal plasma creatinine level . \n plasma creatinine levels began to rise within 24 h in 80% of the patients with rin , peaking at 4872 h , and returning to baseline after 2 weeks . \n the first 24 h remains unclear in patients with acute renal injury , but il-18 levels start to increase within 46 h , peaking at 12 h. additionally , plasma creatinine is affected by age , body weight , total body volume , gender , race , drug use , muscle mass , and protein intake so researchers are looking for a diagnostic marker for rin that can be measured easily and is not affected by nonrenal factors . \n most studies related to these parameters include serum and urine cystatin c , serum and urine ngal , and urine il-18 in the analysis . \n as proinflammatory cytokine il-18 levels increase in urine , tubular inflammation , such as ischemia , reperfusion injury , allograft rejection , cisplatin toxicity , and endotoxemia occur . \n parikh et al . , found that 72 patients with acute tubular necrosis and delayed graft reaction have significantly higher il-18 levels than other kidney diseases ( urinary tract infection , chronic renal failure , nephrotic syndrome , or prerenal azotemia ) . \n reported that il-18 generally showed a low sensitivity but high specificity , respectively , for assessing an acute kidney injury diagnosis and risk classification . in our study , we examined spot urinary il-18 levels in comparison with plasma creatinine levels . \n a weak positive correlation was found between precontrast creatinine and urine il-18 levels , although it was not statistically significant . furthermore , we also found a weak positive correlation between postcontrast 24 h creatinine and urine il-18 levels , although this was not statistically significant either . \n a slight increase in plasma creatinine levels at 24 h and 48 h following radiocontrast administration was observed compared with precontrast values , but it was not statistically significant which was regressed to precontrast values at 72 h. a statistically significant increase in the level of spot urinary il-18 levels at 6 and 24 h postcontrast was observed , compared with precontrast spot urine il-18 levels and difference between 6 and 24 hour levels were not statistically significant . \n one of the limitations of this study is that there are other early biomarkers of acute kidney injury such as ngal and kim-1 . \n another limitation is that urine il-18 measurement was indexed to serum creatinine instead of urine creatinine since serum creatinine is considered to be a better and commonly used marker in the diagnosis of acute kidney injury . in conclusion , \n spot urine il-18 levels at sixth hour following radiocontrast administration suggesting that it may be an earlier parameter for identifying kidney injury .",
