    "input": "anxiety affects quality of life in those living with parkinson 's disease ( pd ) more so than overall cognitive status , motor deficits , apathy , and depression [ 13 ] . \n although anxiety and depression are often related and coexist in pd patients , recent research suggests that anxiety rather than depression is the most prominent and prevalent mood disorder in pd [ 5 , 6 ] . yet , \n our current understanding of anxiety and its impact on cognition in pd , as well as its neural basis and best treatment practices , remains meager and lags far behind that of depression . \n overall , neuropsychiatric symptoms in pd have been shown to be negatively associated with cognitive performance . \n for example , higher depression scores have been correlated with lower scores on the mini - mental state exam ( mmse ) [ 8 , 9 ] as well as tests of memory and executive functions ( e.g. , attention ) [ 1014 ] . \n likewise , apathy and anhedonia in pd patients have been associated with executive dysfunction [ 10 , 1523 ] . \n however , few studies have specifically investigated the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd . \n one study showed a strong negative relationship between anxiety ( both state and trait ) and overall cognitive performance ( measured by the total of the repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status index ) within a sample of 27 pd patients . \n furthermore , trait anxiety was negatively associated with each of the cognitive domains assessed by the rbans ( i.e. , immediate memory , visuospatial construction , language , attention , and delayed memory ) . \n two further studies have examined whether anxiety differentially affects cognition in patients with left - sided dominant pd ( lpd ) versus right - sided dominant pd ( rpd ) ; however , their findings were inconsistent . \n the first study found that working memory performance was worse in lpd patients with anxiety compared to rpd patients with anxiety , whereas the second study reported that , in lpd , apathy but not anxiety was associated with performance on nonverbally mediated executive functions and visuospatial tasks ( e.g. , tmt - b , wms - iii spatial span ) , while in rpd , anxiety but not apathy significantly correlated with performance on verbally mediated tasks ( e.g. , clock reading test and boston naming test ) . \n furthermore , anxiety was significantly correlated with neuropsychological measures of attention and executive and visuospatial functions . taken together , \n it is evident that there are limited and inconsistent findings describing the relationship between anxiety and cognition in pd and more specifically how anxiety might influence particular domains of cognition such as attention and memory and executive functioning . \n it is also striking that , to date , no study has examined the influence of anxiety on cognition in pd by directly comparing groups of pd patients with and without anxiety while excluding depression . \n given that research on healthy young adults suggests that anxiety reduces processing capacity and impairs processing efficiency , especially in the central executive and attentional systems of working memory [ 26 , 27 ] , we hypothesized that pd patients with anxiety would show impairments in attentional set - shifting and working memory compared to pd patients without anxiety . \n furthermore , since previous work , albeit limited , has focused on the influence of symptom laterality on anxiety and cognition , we also explored this relationship . \n seventeen pd patients with anxiety and thirty - three pd patients without anxiety were included in this study ( see table 1 ) . \n the cross - sectional data from these participants was taken from a patient database that has been compiled over the past 8 years ( since 2008 ) at the parkinson 's disease research clinic at the brain and mind centre , university of sydney . \n inclusion criteria involved a diagnosis of idiopathic pd according to the united kingdom parkinson 's disease society brain bank criteria   and were confirmed by a neurologist ( sjgl ) . \n patients also had to have an adequate proficiency in english and have completed a full neuropsychological assessment . \n ten patients in this study ( 5 pd with anxiety ; 5 pd without anxiety ) were taking psychotropic drugs ( i.e. , benzodiazepine or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ) . \n patients were also excluded if they had other neurological disorders , psychiatric disorders other than affective disorders ( such as anxiety ) , or if they reported a score greater than six on the depression subscale of the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) . \n thus , all participants who scored within a  depressed  ( hads - d > 6 ) range were excluded from this study , in attempt to examine a refined sample of pd patients with and without anxiety in order to determine the independent effect of anxiety on cognition . \n this research was approved by the human research ethics committee of the university of sydney , and written informed consent was obtained from all participants . \n self - reported hads was used to assess anxiety in pd and has been previously shown to be a useful measure of clinical anxiety in pd . \n a cut - off score of > 8 on the anxiety subscale of the hads ( hads - a ) was used to identify pd cases with anxiety ( pda+ ) , while a cut - off score of < 6 on the hads - a was used to identify pd cases without anxiety ( pda ) . \n this criterion was more stringent than usual ( > 7 cut - off score ) , in effort to create distinct patient groups . \n the neurological evaluation rated participants according to hoehn and yahr ( h&y ) stages   and assessed their motor symptoms using part iii of the revised mds task force unified parkinson 's disease rating scale ( updrs ) . in a similar way \n this was determined by calculating a total left and right score from rigidity items 3035 , voluntary movement items 3643 , and tremor items 5057 from the mds - updrs part iii ( see table 1 ) . \n processing speed was assessed using the trail making test , part a ( tmt - a , z - score ) . \n attentional set - shifting was measured using the trail making test , part b ( tmt - b , z - score ) . \n working memory was assessed using the digit span forward and backward subtest of the wechsler memory scale - iii ( raw scores ) . \n language was assessed with semantic and phonemic verbal fluency via the controlled oral word associated test ( cowat animals and letters , z - score ) . \n the ability to retain learned verbal memory was assessed using the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale - iii ( lm - i z - score , lm - ii z - score , % lm retention z - score ) . the mini - mental state examination ( mmse ) \n demographic , clinical , and neuropsychological variables were compared between the two groups with the independent t - test or mann  whitney u test , depending on whether the variable met parametric assumptions . \n chi - square tests were used to examine gender and symptom laterality differences between groups . \n all analyses employed an alpha level of p < 0.05 and were two - tailed . \n spearman correlations were performed separately in each group to examine associations between anxiety and/or depression ratings and cognitive functions . \n as expected , the pda+ group reported significant greater levels of anxiety on the hads - a ( u = 0 , p < 0.001 ) and higher total score on the hads ( u = 1 , p < 0.001 ) compared to the pda group ( table 1 ) . \n groups were matched in age ( t(48 ) = 1.31 , p = 0.20 ) , disease duration ( u = 259 , p = 0.66 ) , updrs - iii score ( u = 250.5 , p = 0.65 ) , h&y ( u = 245 , p = 0.43 ) , ledd ( u = 159.5 , p = 0.80 ) , and depression ( hads - d ) ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.06 ) . \n additionally , all groups were matched in the distribution of gender (  = 0.098 , p = 0.75 ) and side - affected (  = 0.765 , p = 0.38 ) . \n there were no group differences for tmt - a performance ( u = 256 , p = 0.62 ) ( table 2 ) ; however , the pda+ group had worse performance on the trail making test part b ( t(46 ) = 2.03 , p = 0.048 ) compared to the pda group ( figure 1 ) . \n the pda+ group also demonstrated significantly worse performance on the digit span forward subtest ( t(48 ) = 2.22 , p = 0.031 ) and backward subtest ( u = 190.5 , p = 0.016 ) compared to the pda group ( figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) ) . \n neither semantic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.70 , p = 0.49 ) nor phonemic verbal fluency ( t(47 ) = 0.39 , p = 0.70 ) differed between groups . \n logical memory i immediate recall test ( u = 176 , p = 0.059 ) showed a trend that the pda+ group had worse new verbal learning and immediate recall abilities than the pda group . however , logical memory ii test performance ( u = 219 , p = 0.204 ) and logical memory % retention ( u = 242.5 , p = 0.434 ) did not differ between groups . \n there were also no differences between groups in global cognition ( mmse ) ( u = 222.5 , p = 0.23 ) . \n partici...",

    "input": "small non - coding rnas are transcribed into mrna but remain untranslated in eukaryotic cells . \n they include sirna ( small interfering rna ) , mirna ( microrna ) , pirna ( piwi - interacting rna ) and snorna ( small nucleolar rna ) . \n mirnas are a class of multifunctional singled - stranded small rna which are ~20  nt in length and regulate the stability or translational efficiency of targeted messenger rna depending on the base - pairing complementarity between the mirna and its target mrna [ 1 , 2 ] . although over 1,000 mirna sequences have been identified from the tissues or cells of human origin and other species , as many as 1,000 to 10,000 mirnas per genome have been predicted [ 3 , 4 ] . \n mirnas regulate a broad range of biological processes including timing of development , cell cycle progression , stem cell self - renewal , differentiation , cancer initiation , cancer cell proliferation , metastasis and apoptosis [ 511 ] . \n cancer is caused by multiple processes including uncontrolled cellular proliferation and inappropriate survival of apoptotic cells . \n many regulatory factors switch on or off genes that govern cell division and direct cellular proliferation . \n mirnas regulate gene expression and play important roles in the onset and progression of tumorigenesis . \n emerging evidence demonstrates the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis , functioning either as tumor suppressors or oncogenes . \n although the current treatment of radiation therapy , chemotherapy and hormone therapy slow mammary gland tumor growth , prolong survival and improve the quality of patients life , metastatic breast cancer still remains incurable due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tumorigenesis and metastasis occur . \n as small non - coding rnas regulate gene expression and tumorigenesis , they may represent a novel cancer therapy . \n unlike mrna , mirnas are transcribed but never translated . some mirnas are transcribed from non - coding regions between genes , deriving from independent transcription unit . \n other mirnas are transcribed together with coding mrnas from the coding region of the genome , deriving from the introns of gene transcripts [ 13 , 14 ] . \n mirna gene copy number gain / loss and mirna gene mutation have been observed in breast cancer resulting in the aberrant expression of mirna . \n the first study about the altered expression of mirnas in human breast cancer patients and human breast cancer cell lines was reported in 2005 by lorio et al . , \n in which 29 mirnas were identified with aberrant expression based on microarray and northern blot analysis of 76 breast tumor samples and 14 human breast cell lines . \n zhang and colleagues analyzed 283 human mirna genes on 55 human breast primary tumors and 18 human breast cancer cell lines using array - based comparative genomic hybridization . \n the results demonstrated a high frequency ( ~72.8% ) of gene copy number abnormality in mirna - containing regions in human breast cancer . \n wang et al . collected 68 patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and examined the expression of selected mirnas in tumor and adjacent non - tumor tissues . \n mir-21 , mir-106a and mir-155 were significantly over - expressed in the tumor specimens compared with normal controls , whereas mir-126 , mir-199a and mir-335 were significantly decreased in expression in the tumor samples . \n our studies of the mir-17 - 92 cluster demonstrated decreased expression of mir-17/20 in human breast cancer specimens compared with matching normal breast tissue from the same patient . \n subsequent analysis identified reduced mir-17/20 expression in node - positive compared with node - negative breast cancers and demonstrated that mir-17/20 inhibited breast cancer cell migration and invasion via a heterotypic signaling . \n although the tendency for a global decrease of mirna expression in human cancers originally suggested a general tumor suppressor function of mirnas , subsequent studies showing the aberrant expression of specific mirnas in breast cancer suggest mirna - specific roles in breast cancer onset and progression . \n many distinct mirnas have been shown to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation , apoptosis , cancer stem cell expansion , and tumorigenesis . \n mirna may function as either tumor suppressors or oncogenes depending on the cell type , culture conditions , target genes and pathway . \n the involvement of mirna in mammary gland tumorigenesis has been reviewed recently [ 21 , 22 ] . \n le et al . described the expression pattern and regulatory network of key mirnas in breast cancer , including let-7 , mir-34 , mir-125 , mir-200 family , mir-205 , mir-21 , mir-10 and the mir-17 - 92 cluster . \n adams et al . reviewed the mirna regulation of estrogen signaling pathway and erbb2/her signaling pathway in breast cancer . \n the understanding of how mirnas are involved in breast cancer through regulating the cell cycle remains rudimentary . \n herein we summarize the recent literature and research progress on the mechanism by which mirnas regulate the breast cancer cell cycle and cellular proliferation ( fig . \n 1mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint mirna regulation of mammary gland tumorigenesis in control of the cell cycle . through targeting different genes and different cyclin / cdk complexes , mir-17/20 and \n let-7 regulate the g1-s transition ; mir-21 and mir-27a regulate the g2-m checkpoint cyclin d1 is either overexpressed or amplified in ~50% of breast cancer . \n the abundance of cyclin d1 is rate - limiting in breast cancer cellular proliferation and g1-s phase transition [ 23 , 24 ] . \n in addition , cyclin d1 is a critical downstream target of erbb2- , ras- and -catenin- induced breast cancers , and is sufficient for the induction of mammary tumors when targeted to the mammary gland of mice . \n antisense inhibition of cyclin d1 expression in vivo suppressed the growth of neut - transformed mammary adenocarcinoma cells in nude mice . \n conserved sequences of the cyclin d1 3utr contain potential binding sites for multiple mirnas including mir-17/20/106 , mir-15/16 , mir-23 and let-7 . \n mir-17/20 binds the cyclin d1 3utr , inhibiting the expression of cyclin d1 , resulting in cell cycle arrest at the g1 phase and suppression of mcf-7 cell proliferation [ 18 , 26 ] . \n the regulation of cyclin d1 expression by mir-17 - 92 , as well as mir-15/16 , was confirmed by deshpande et al . . \n the let-7 family functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of cancers including lung , colon , ovarian   and breast cancer . \n schultz et al . demonstrated the downregulation of cyclin d1 by mirna let-7 in control of cancer cell growth . \n the regulation of cyclin d1 by mirna is likely of broad importance as cyclin d1 encodes the regulatory subunit of a kinase that phosphorylates and inactivates the prb family proteins to inhibit dna synthesis , and phosphorylates nuclear respiratory factor 1 ( nrf-1 ) to inhibit mitochondria biogenesis [ 32 , 33 ] . \n furthermore , cyclin d1 promotes breast epithelial cell angiogenesis and migration , and promotes chromosomal instability which in turn contributes to tumorigenesis . \n the mir-221/222 cluster regulates the cell cycle , cell growth and epithelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( emt ) in breast cancer . \n mir-221/222 inhibited p27 and p57 abundance , facilitating g1-s phase transition , thereby promoting cancer cell proliferation [ 36 , 37 ] . \n moreover , mir-221/222 may contribute to the aggressive clinical behavior of basal - like breast cancers . \n the breast cancer basal - like subtype - specific mirnas , mir-221 and mir-222 , promote emt in breast cancer by targeting trps1 ( trichorhinophalangeal syndrome type 1 ) which inhibits emt by repressing zeb2 expression . \n mir-221 and/or mir-222 expression in mcf-7 and t47d breast cancer cells decreased er expression associated with tamoxifen resistance . \n the onco - mirna mir-21 is overexpressed in a wide variety of cancers including breast cancer [ 40 , 41 ] . \n mir-21 induced cellular proliferation , migration , invasion , emt , cancer stem cell characteristics and chemotherapy resistance in human breast cancer [ 42 , 43 ] . \n high mir-21 level is associated with poor prognosis , advanced stage , positive lymph node status and reduced survival time in breast cancer . \n mir-21 promotes mcf-7 cellular proliferation in part through inhibiting the expression of a tumor suppressor gene programmed cell death 4 ( pdcd4 ) . in colon cancer , \n mir-21 participates in a dna damage - induced g2-m checkpoint through suppressing the cell cycle regulator cdc25a . \n a recent report demonstrated the mir-21 regulates the cell cycle through targeting cd...",

threatening conditions  ( rizk et al . , 1990 ) . among the serious manifestations of ohss are ascites and pleural effusion  ( rizk and smitz , 1992 ) . \n vascular endothelial growth factor has emerged as one of the factors most likely involved in the pathophysiology of ohss  ( geva and jaffe , 2000 ; rizk and aboulghar , 2010 ) . \n vascular endothelial growth factor is an angiogenic cytokine that is a potent stimulator of the vascular endothelium and appears to play an integral role in follicular growth , corpus luteum function and ovarian angiogenesis  ( rizk et al . , 1997 ) . \n vascular endothelial growth factor causes increased capillary permeability with its sequelae of ascites and possible pleural effusion  ( rizk et al . , 1997 ; gomez et al . , 2002 ) . \n human chorionic gonadotrophin is thought to play a crucial role in the development of ohss  ( rizk et al . \n two distinct forms of severe ohss have been described : early and late forms  ( papanikolaou et al . , 2005 ; mathur et al . , 2000 ) . \n early ohss is caused by the administration of exogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin  ( hcg ) and it starts before the 10th day after oocyte retrieval , while the late form is the result of endogenous human chorionic gonadotrophin release in the event of pregnancy , and it starts after the 10th day following oocyte aspiration  ( papanikolaou et al . , 2005 ; \n such strategies included the use of low dose gonadotropins and frequent monitoring during controlled ovarian stimulation , cycle cancellation , coasting , freeze all embryos and the use of gonadotropin releasing hormone  ( gnrh ) agonist as an oocyte trigger in gnrh antagonist cycles  ( rizk et al . \n the use of antagonist in the luteal phase with total freeze of embryos to prevent severe ohss has also been suggested  ( lainas et al . , 2012 ) . \n such strategies should be used especially in patients at high risk for developing severe ohss , including those who are young , have low body weight , have polycystic ovary syndrome , those who experience high estradiol levels , rapidly increasing estradiol levels , high number of follicles during controlled ovarian stimulation and those with high number of oocytes retrieved  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ; delvigne , 2009 ) . \n dopamine agonists have been proposed for the prevention of ohss in women at high risk . however , the study by lvarez et al . \n ( 2007 ) suggested that it was only effective in reducing the incidence of moderate ohss , but not in its severe form  ( alvarez et al . , 2007 ) . \n low - dose aspirin therapy and doxycycline have also been suggested to inhibit angiogenesis  ( fainaru et al . , 2009 ) . \n ( 2011 ) believes that the concept of an ohss - free clinic has become a reality . \n the authors suggest that this approach should include pituitary down - regulation using a gnrh antagonist , ovulation triggering with a gnrh agonist and vitrification of oocytes or embryos  ( devroey et al . , 2011 ) . \n severe and critical forms of ohss are associated with significant ascites  ( golan et al . , 1989 ; rizk et al . , \n ascites results in an increased abdominal pressure compromising venous return , cardiac output and renal perfusion  ( navot et al . \n paracentesis is frequently needed , as prompt drainage of fluid produces a significant clinical and biochemical improvement , including spontaneous diuresis and hastening the resolution process  ( rizk et al . \n , multiple paracenteses may be required to relieve symptoms and avoid serious sequelae of hemoconcentration , hypotension , decreased renal perfusion and severe respiratory compromise . instead of multiple interventions , \n the placement of a catheter temporarily for a few days will permit complete drainage through one procedure  ( rizk and aboulghar , 1999 ) . \n pigtail catheters have been used for drainage in various clinical situations . in a previous study we described the use of percutaneous placement of a pigtail catheter for drainage of ascites caused by severe / critical ohss  ( abuzeid et al . , 2003 ) . \n in this study we established the efficacy and safety of pigtail catheter drainage in the management of severe / critical ohss in patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer at our centre between 1999 and 2001 on both inpatient and outpatient basis . \n the aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of the pigtail catheter drainage in outpatient management of patients with early onset severe ohss . \n this is a retrospective study that included all patients who underwent in vitro fertilization and developed severe or critical ohss by the golan classification  ( golan et al . , 1989 ) in the period between 2004 and 2009 . \n all patients underwent an ultrasound evaluation which documented the presence of severe ascites and bilateral ovarian enlargement . \n all patients presented with shortness of breath , marked abdominal distension , nausea , weight gain and lower abdominal pain . \n thirteen patients complained of vomiting , and 3 patients reported decreased urine output  ( less than 720 cc per 24  hours ) and had haemoglobin   15 g / dl . \n all 33 patients were offered treatment using pigtail catheter insertion as an alternative to trans -

obese diabetic ( nod ) mice , \n biobreeding rats , or diabetes induced in susceptible rodent strains by multiple low doses of streptozotocin ( mlds ) are now available ( 3 ) . in the pathogenesis of t1d , several proinflamma - tory cytokines including ifn -  , tnf- , il-1 , as well as il-17 ( 4 - 6 ) , have been implicated . \n it is also thought that the production of anti - inflammatory cytokines such as il-4 , il-10 and tgf- correlates with protection from t1d ( 6 ) . \n it has been shown that some drugs such as pentoxifylline ( ptx ) have immunomodulatory and anti - inflammatory activity , which might represent a potential preventive therapy for autoimmune diseases . \n ptx is a methyl xanthine - derived general phosphodiesterase ( pde ) inhibitor that has been available for many years to treat vascular disorder ( 7 ) . \n phosphodiesterases ( pdes ) are a family of enzymes that regulate intracellular levels of the cyclic nucleotides cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( camp ) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cgmp ) by catalyzing their breakdown to inactive metabolites . \n drugs that increase the levels of camp , tend to reduce the production of proinflammatory mediators and increase the production of anti - inflammatory mediators by immune cells ( 8) . in recent years , the potential of ptx as an immunomodulatory and anti - inflammatory agent gained interest as it has been shown to effectively suppress the synthesis of tnf- and other pro inflammatory cytokines such as ifn -  and il-12 in vitro and in vivo ( 9 - 10 ) . \n ptx has been successfully used for the treatment of experimental autoimmune diseases including experimental autoimmune myocarditis ( eam ) ( 11 ) , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis ( 12 ) , and adjuvant arthritis ( 13 ) . in the present study \n , we hypothesized that pentoxifylline , due to its anti -

threatening illness experiences and complex treatments , different technologies and different equipment are used for them . \n these cases could potentially lead to the dissatisfaction of their families . in the meantime , \n the families of trauma and neurosurgical patients are more vulnerable than the other groups of patients . \n they need supports that are more emotional and should be accepted by the icu staff . today , there are many theories expressed that in intensive care units , the patient and his family should be considered as a single unit . by providing care to this unit , \n the aim of this study was to analyze the satisfaction of the families of icu patients . \n the tool of society of critical care medicine s family needs assessment ( sccmfna ) ( which has been validated in 1998 by johnson ) was used in that study . \n the results showed that most of the family satisfaction was related to the communication and patient care and the lowest level of satisfaction was about the ability of staff to patients family comfort . \n bailey et al . have conducted a study in 2009 with the purpose of investigating the relationship between informational support to families of special care patients and their anxiety and satisfaction . \n they showed that there is a direct link between the informational support and their satisfaction . \n the study of fumis et al . in 2008 also showed that the increase in the availability of physicians for giving the information to the patient s family and as well as nurses efforts to provide understandable explanations about the patient s condition to them will increase the patient s family satisfaction . \n this clinical trial was performed with respect to the existing gap for a study carried out for investigating the interventions for the satisfaction of the patients in the special care units and their families in iran . \n the purpose of the study was to determine the effectiveness of nursing interventions based on family needs on family satisfaction level of hospitalized patients in the neurosurgery intensive care unit of al -

    "input": "development of human societies and industrialization as well as changes in stress sources has changed disease pattern in civilized societies . as a result , the disease pattern has changed from traditional diseases such as infectious diseases and malnutrition to diseases such as heart disease , diabetes , accidents and so forth . among them \n coronary artery disease is the most cardiovascular disorder as a health problem in developing and developed countries . \n in fact , this is not only a chronic disease associated with high mortality , but it causes limitations in life and disability in a large part of the productive forces of the country . \n it is also associated with reduced production and increased medical costs [ 3 - 5 ] . nowadays , \n cardiovascular diseases are among the most widespread chronic diseases in most countries . according to forecasts , \n the mortality rate in eastern mediterranean countries including iran will be 30 - 35% [ 6 , 7 ] . despite the emphasis on prevention and development of newtreatments , surgery is the only choice for many patients with cardiovascular disease . \n one of the surgical procedures for the treatment of cardiovascular patients is coronary artery bypass surgery . \n in fact , heart surgery significantly influences on the quality of life of patients with cardiovascular diseases . \n hence , heart surgery is an important event in the lives of patients causing collapse of economic , professional and personal life . on the other hand , each surgical procedure \n is associated with several psychological complications for patients . of the most important complications are anxiety and depression so that approximately 65% of cardiovascular patients experience them after surgical and medical interventions . \n in fact , anxiety and depression complicate the treatment process [ 7 , 8 ] . \n some scientists believe that anxiety is one of the essential elements of human life . however , acute and long - term anxiety is integral part of all psychological diseases . according to nemati and colleagues , \n in fact , anxiety is a common psychological response of cardiovascular patients which is associated with reduced quality of life and psychological morbidity [ 11 , 12 ] . on the other hand , \n anxiety causes increased heart rate and breathing as well as high blood pressure and even mortality . \n it is associated with increased risk of mortality , disability , increased medical care and functional impairment in daily activities [ 12 , 13 ] . clinical depression has been reported in 54% of patients after bypass surgery . according to world health organization ( who ) , depression is the fourth chronic disease where its disability is comparable with 8 major chronic disorders . \n the outcome of depression in patients with cardiovascular disease is deterioration of physical and emotional state . given the incidence of such complications in patients with cardiovascular disease \n the best practice in this area is appropriate communication with patient [ 13 , 15 ] . \n good and effective communication is very valuable from the perspective of patients . in general , communication is a set of learning skills . \n in fact , poor communication is the cause of most problems in treatment of patients . \n in fact , communication at the bedside is a therapeutic and professional communication . in health professionals , \n communication and communication skills play a very important role in satisfaction of patients and solving their problems . \n this is more important , especially in patients with chronic diseases or those requiring long - term care . \n the therapeutic communication is formed from the first encounter of the patient with the medical team [ 21 , 22 ] . \n however , studies have shown that the communication between patient and medical team is not efficient . \n the health personnel don not have adequate communication skills . in fact , nursing and medical team spend very little time to communicate with patients . \n accordingly , patients are not often satisfied with received information as well as the level and method of communication . \n hence , to achieve best therapeutic results , special attention should be paid to communication [ 16 , 19 , 22 ] . \n since nursing is a practical discipline based on professional knowledge , it is necessary to use knowledge infrastructure to develop new approaches in clinical practice . \n theories proposed by nursing scientists can be useful in this area [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . for this purpose \n the nurse - patient communication is an essential element of this theory [ 21 , 24 ] . according to peplau theory , \n the purpose of nursing care is to achieve a common good nurse - patient communication . according to peplau , \n peplau refers to the importance of therapeutic communication with patients and its important role in reducing anxiety [ 21 , 23 , 24 ] . \n in fact , this theory provides a framework for nurse - patient communication . following this framework \n , the nurse will be able to respond communication needs of patients through establishing a good therapeutic communication with the patient [ 16 , 19 , 23 ] . \n hospitalization and a complex surgery such as heart surgery is a stressful process leading to depression in patients . \n furthermore , the need for security and psychological comfort is one of the basic needs of patients achieved through a proper structured therapeutic communication with low cost . \n accordingly , the objective of the present study is to examine the impact of peplau therapeutic communication model on anxiety and depression in patients who were candidate for coronary bypass surgery . \n this is a clinical trial with pre / post testing scheme examined the impact of independent variable ( peplau therapeutic communication ) on the dependent variables ( anxiety and depression ) . \n the population consisted of all patients who were candidates for coronary artery bypass referred to the research environment on non - emergency basis . \n the research environment was al - zahra heart hospital in shiraz due to the easy access to subjects and sufficient number of patients . \n data were collected using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( kanter et al . ) . \n the reliability and validity of the scale have been studied by montazeri et al in 2003 . \n an internal consistency of 78% and 86% was respectively calculated for anxiety and depression using cronbach 's alpha . \n there are 14 four - option questions , each with a score of zero to 3 . \n odd and even questions are used to measure anxiety and depression , respectively ( seven questions to assess anxiety and seven questions to assess depression ) . \n a score of zero to 21 is given to each patient based on responses in each area ( a score of zero - seven : normal , eight-10 : moderate and > 10 : disease ) . \n due to the lack of access to error rate to calculate the sample size , 10 patients were selected as pilot ( with a depression and anxiety score of 10 or more based on the hospital anxiety and depression scale ) . after performing tests , \n the subjects were randomly divided into test and control groups ( using a coin ( toss ) ) . \n z12+z12s12+s22x1x22 the inclusion criteria were : being in a bypass list , having moderate to severe depression and anxiety scores , no history of mental illness , interesting in participating in the study ( i.e. the tendency of the patient and his family to participate in the intervention ) , lack of previous bypass surgery , aged between 35 and 70 years , ability to communicate verbally and ability to speak persian . \n the exclusion criteria included : lack of cooperation of patients and families during the intervention , failure to perform coronary artery bypass surgery for various reasons , mortality during the study , failure to attend therapeutic communication sessions ( at least the absence in two sessions ) . \n therapeutic communication sessions were held for the intervention group based on peplau 's model at four stages including : orientation , identification , exploitation and resolution . in total , seven sessions were held individually with the consent of the patient and his family at the hospital and patient 's home \n . it should be notedthat during therapeutic communication , duration of each session was variable given the location and patient 's needs . \n the place of each meeting was determined with the consent of the patient . at all meetings , the researcher used verbal and nonverbal communication skills to communicate with patients . to ensure the correct application of therapeutic communication skills , a self - control researcher - made tool approved by experts was used . \n the depression and anxiety of patients in both groups were assessed using the hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) at baseline and then two and four months after surgery . \n the obtained data were analyzed using descriptive statistics as well as covariance analysis with the ...",

    "input": "rising levels of obesity are becoming a worldwide phenomenon and are increasingly identified as a health problem across the globe [ 14 ] . \n higher weight has been associated with adverse health indicators and outcomes , including cardiovascular disease [ 512 ] , stroke [ 5 , 13 ] , cognitive and functional decline [ 1418 ] , metabolic syndrome [ 19 , 20 ] , inflammation [ 21 , 22 ] , and mortality [ 20 , 2325 ] . \n obesity among aging populations is relatively recent and aging among people who have been obese for much of their lives is also a new phenomenon . from 1980 to 2004 , the prevalence of obesity in the us has continued to rise from about 17% to 25% for men aged 5059 . while obesity in england has also increased during this period , from approximately 9% in 1980 to 15% in 2004 for men aged 5564 , the level of obesity remains much lower in england . \n additionally , the difference in obesity between the us and england is more pronounced for women . \n the level of obesity in us women was about 24% in 1980 and rose to 37% in 2004 ( age 5059 ) ; in england , levels for women were 9% in 1980 and 14% in 2004 ( age 5564 ) . \n the aim of this paper is to investigate differences in how obesity relates to indicators of physiological dysregulation in men and women of diverse populations . \n this comparison will lead to an improved understanding of how obesity might be differentially related to health and mortality across cultures and lifestyles . \n obesity was relatively rare in most populations until the second part of the last century , but it has now become common in many countries \n . the us population is recognized as among the most obese in the world , although many other countries are now approaching the us level and most countries are experiencing increasing obesity . \n this worldwide obesity epidemic began with the epidemiological revolution and the virtual elimination of infectious disease ; the decline in manual labor needed to provide sustenance with the industrial revolution ; and the increasing availability and decreasing cost of food [ 2729 ] . \n obesity reflects some combination of calorie intake , diet content , and amount of physical activity . in some cultures , \n lack of physical activity can be a more important determinant of obesity ; in other cultures , overeating or food composition may be the more important determinant of obesity . \n it is also true that within countries , individuals could differ in the causes of obesity . \n for instance , changes in activity might be more characteristic of women or men resulting in different reasons for obesity by gender . \n these differences may affect how obesity is related to other risk factors for poor health , and it may determine the overall health risk associated with obesity . if physical activity is maintained , the overall effect of obesity may be less than if the activity is not . \n one indication of the cause of obesity may be the relationship between waist size and weight [ 30 , 31 ] . in societies where obese people are more physically active , waist size of the obese \n waist circumference has also been linked to late life mortality , where high waist circumference has been associated with increased mortality among men and women in the netherlands , while high bmi was not associated with mortality . \n this paper builds upon current obesity research by using both bmi and waist circumference to quantify obesity in order to determine how a combined indicator of weight and adiposity is related to physiological dysregulation in populations with different cultures , diets , behaviors , and epidemiological histories . \n obesity has been related to many indicators of physiological dysregulation including cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension   and metabolic dysregulation in lipid levels or insulin resistance . \n most studies that investigate the differences in biological risk associated with excess weight have examined western populations [ 33 , 36 ] . \n comparative studies on the health risks associated with obesity that examined the us and england reported that obese americans had an increased risk of diabetes and a higher waist circumference [ 37 , 38 ] . \n these studies suggested that differences in physical activity , diet , and social environments may explain these national differences . \n while these differences have been observed between the us and england , these two western countries have roughly similar life expectancy , levels of living , history , and culture even while the us has poorer health by a number of indicators of disease prevalence and biological risk [ 36 , 39 ] . \n comparative studies of the links between obesity and health outcomes and risk factors for obesity comparing western and non - western countries indicate important differences in the causes and consequences of obesity . \n a comparison of the association of disease with overweight and obesity in japan and the us indicated that the associations were stronger in the us than in japanese women and that there was no association in japanese men . \n links between social , demographic , and behavioral risk factors for obesity also differ markedly in japan , korea , and the us . \n the availability of biomarker data from taiwan  a middle - income country undergoing rapid economic growth , increasing obesity , and with life expectancy recently increasing to levels similar to that of the us and england  allows for investigation of the biological risk associated with obesity in a population characterized by very different cultural , behavioral , socioeconomic , and dietary parameters . \n we examine how elevated weight and obesity ( using an indicator that considers both bmi and waist circumference ) relate to having levels defined as clinical risk for cardiovascular , metabolic , and inflammatory markers in three aging societies that are now relatively similar in life expectancy but that differ in the timing of the epidemiological transition and obesity epidemic , history of economic development , socioeconomic levels , general lifestyle habits , health behaviors , and health care systems : the us , england , and taiwan . \n finding differences in the relationship between obesity and indicators of physiological dysregulation in these three aging societies will clarify whether increases in weight gain are equally problematic across all countries . \n we use data from three nationally representative samples : the us national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes , 20032006 ; n = 3855 ) , the english longitudinal study of ageing ( elsa , 2004 - 2005 ; n = 9139 ) , and the social environment and biomarkers of aging study ( sebas ) in taiwan ( 2000 ; n = 1023 ) . \n these surveys collect information on demographics , as well as anthropometric , physical , and biological measures . \n every year , approximately 5,000 individuals undergo detailed interviews and medical examinations , which include collection of several physiological measures . \n nhanes utilizes a complex sampling design , and when weights are applied , the sample is representative of the noninstitutionalized american population . \n we use the 20032006 data since nhanes data is released in two - year intervals , and this sample is centered on 2004 - 2005 , which matches the period in which elsa was collected . \n for nhanes , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 1,513 fasting individuals aged 54 and older . \n elsa includes participants drawn from households responding to the health survey for england ( hse ) in 1998 , 1999 , and 2001   and is representative of the english population aged 50 and older . \n the core elsa sample ( wave 1 : 2002 - 2003 ) includes people living in an hse responding household who were born prior to march 1 , 1952 , and their partners who could be under age 50 . wave 4 of elsa ( 2008 - 2009 ) , which includes a nurse visit , includes wave 1 core members , if they are still alive and do not refuse further contact after the first interview at wave 1 . \n it also includes a refresher sample to maintain the age structure of the sample ( in waves 3 and 4 ) , and their partners . for elsa , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 7,384 individuals aged 54 and older . \n sebas is drawn from a follow - up survey of the survey of health and living status of the near elderly and elderly in taiwan ( also known as the taiwan longitudinal study of aging ( tlsa ) ) , a nationally representative survey of taiwanese adults ( including institutionalized individuals ) collected in 1989 , 1993 , 1996 , 1999 , and 2000 . in 2000 , a subsample of individuals was randomly selected for inclusion in sebas . \n sebas consists of adults aged 54 and older in 2000 , with in - home interviews and medical exams taken in a hospital . for sebas , \n the sample averages 66.8 years of age in england , and the us and taiwan mean age is about the same ( table 1 ) . \n there are more men in taiwan ( 56% ) an...",

needed assistant to those unenthusiastic potential international patients who do not want to make their trip arrangements by their own . \n many hospitals and clinics linked themselves with airlines to promote their services and offer discounts ( 2 , 5 , 2426 ) . \n literature on medical tourism also reveals the role of practitioner in promotion of medical tourism mainly in underdeveloped countries due to various reasons such as lack of resources , unavailability of equipment , unavailability of infra -

    "input": "squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck ( hnscc ) is a heterogeneous disease that includes tumors arising from the mucosal epithelial surface of the oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , and larynx . although these tumors originate within different anatomic sites within the upper aerodigestive tract , they are histologically identical ( 95% of hnscc are squamous cell carcinomas ) , share common etiologic risk factors and overlapping metastatic target site profiles ( reviewed in [ 13 ] ) . \n recent genetic analysis of human head and neck tumors has revealed common molecular alterations including p53 mutation , p14arf , and p16 methylation , as well as cyclin d and egfr amplification [ 36 ] . despite these similarities , \n the distinct anatomic subsites are associated with differing rates of regional metastasis  for example , vocal cord lesions tend to metastasize less frequently than oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal lesions . this variation may be attributed to differing densities of lymph draining vessels within each of the relevant subsites . \n patients who exhibit metastases into the regional nodal basin exhibit a 50% decrease in survival irrespective of treatment [ 715 ] . \n currently , it is the 5th leading cause of cancer by incidence and the 6th leading cause of cancer mortality in the world [ 16 , 17 ] . \n recurrent and/or metastatic hnscc patients have a poor prognosis , with a median survival of less than 1 - 2 years [ 18 , 19 ] . \n several lines of evidence indicate that cancer is a disease resulting from dynamic changes in the genome that promote the progressive transformation of normal human cells into highly malignant derivatives [ 20 , 21 ] . during this process , \n cancer cells acquire several unique capabilities including self - sufficiency in response to growth signals , insensitivity to antigrowth signals , evasion of programmed death ( apoptosis ) , limitless replicative potential , sustained angiogenesis as well as invasion and metastasis , reprogramming of energy metabolism , and avoiding immune destruction [ 21 , 22 ] . \n detailed global genomic analyses of several human tumors has revealed that certain classes of signaling proteins appear to be targeted more frequently by oncogenic mutations . \n receptor tyrosine kinases ( rtks ) are a good example . of the 59 transmembrane rtks identified to date , \n dysregulation of ~30 rtks are associated with neoplastic transformation and cancer progression [ 2325 ] . \n interestingly , ninety percent of primary head and neck squamous cell cancers , irrespective of subsite , have alterations in members of the epidermal growth factor ( egf ) family of receptor tyrosine kinases ( erbbs ) , in particular erbb1/egfr . \n ten to fifteen percent of tumors will also have an alteration in another egfr family member , the erbb2/her2/neu receptor [ 27 , 28 ] . \n these findings suggest a strong etiologic role for rtk dysregulation in this type of tumors . given this association , patients with head and neck squamous cell cancers are well positioned to benefit from existing and future molecular targeted agents directed against oncogenic rtks such as egfr ( reviewed in ) . \n rtks are a family of transmembrane proteins that mediate many important physiological processes in both normal and cancerous cells . \n ligand binding to the extracellular domain of rtks induces receptor dimerization and activation of rtk activity . \n subsequent autophosphorylation of the receptor at specific tyrosine residues within the cytoplasmic domain generates binding sites for proteins that relay downstream biological signals to regulate protein function , protein - protein interactions , and gene expression . under physiological conditions , \n rtk dysregulation can occur through several mechanisms including gene amplification or rtk overexpression , chromosomal translocation to produce constitutively active rtks , gain of function mutations or deletions that promote ligand - independent rtk activity , escape from negative regulatory mechanisms or local environmental changes , all of which lead to potent oncogenic signaling and hence neoplastic growth . \n these complex signaling networks use multiple factors to drive the outcome of rtk signaling . although often depicted as linear pathways , they actually represent an integrated network with various modes of cross - talk , overlapping and distinct functions . \n known signaling pathways involved in head and neck tumorigenesis include the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( pi3k)-akt - mammalian target of rapamycin ( mtor ) , signal transducer and activator of transcription ( stats ) and raf kinase - mitogen - activated protein kinase kinase ( mek)-p42/p44 mitogen activated protein kinase ( mapk ) signaling pathways [ 1 , 30 ] . \n this review highlights three rtk signaling pathways involved in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ; egfr , the type 1 insulin - like growth factor receptor ( igf-1r ) and the hepatocyte growth factor ( hgf ) receptor ( met ) . \n this short review will explore the relative contribution of each signaling axis to disease progression , potential modes of cross - talk , and targeted clinical approaches under investigation for disease management . \n the egfr family of rtks is comprised of four different receptors known as erbb1 ( also referred to as egfr ) , erbb2 ( her2/neu in rodents ) , erbb3 ( her3 ) , and erbb4 ( her4 ) ( reviewed in [ 3133 ] ) . each receptor , with the exception of erbb3 , contain an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain that is activated by binding to extracellular egf - like ligands , which result in receptor dimerization and hence activation of downstream signaling cascades including mapk , pi3k / akt and stat signaling . \n eleven egf - like ligands have been identified to date that can be categorized into four groups  those that bind egfr only ( egf , transforming growth factor alpha ( tgf ) , and amphiregulin ) , those that bind to egfr and her4 ( heparin binding - egf , betacellulin and epiregulin ) , those binding directly to either her3 and her4 ( neuregulin 1 and neuregulin 2 ) and her4 binding only ( neuregulin 3 and neuregulin 4 ) ( reviewed in ) . \n epigen , the most recently discovered member of the egf - like ligand family appears to be a low affinity and broad specificity ligand that effectively activates egfr . \n erbb2 is considered a ligand - less coreceptor as it does not have any known ligands that bind directly with high affinity , despite its established role as a potent oncogene in several cancer types including breast , colorectal , nonsmall cell lung carcinoma ( nsclc ) and hnscc [ 36 , 37 ] . \n aberrant egfr activity has been strongly linked to the etiology of 5890% of hnscc [ 26 , 38 ] . \n these rates can vary due to the inclusion of cancers from different subsites within the head and neck , methods used to assess gene amplification and tumor scoring methods . in contrast to lung adenocarcinomas in which activating egfr mutations result in ligand - independent signaling [ 3943 ] , such activating egfr mutations are infrequent in hnscc [ 44 , 45 ] . \n egfr gene amplification resulting in upwards of 12 copies per cell has been reported in hnscc patients compared to copy numbers detected in normal mucosa from noncancer patients . \n this and other pathways of ligand - independent receptor activation that do not require egfr overexpression have been characterized as the likely drivers of egfr activity in hnscc . \n egfr gene amplification remains a strong indicator for poor patient survival , radioresistance , and locoregional failure [ 4749 ] . \n egfr overexpression is detected in healthy mucosa in cancer patients ( field cancerization ) that will increase in proportion to observed histological abnormalities such as hyperplasia , carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma , indicating that it is an early event in hnscc . \n accordingly , significant effort has focused on egfr signaling as a therapeutic target for treating hnscc patients . \n cetuximab , matuzumab and nimotuzumab represent humanized antiegfr antibodies , whereas gefitinib and erlotinib are small tyrosine kinase inhibitors ( tkis ) ( figure 1 ) . \n cetuximab ( erbitux ) competitively inhibits endogenous ligand - binding to egfr and thereby inhibits subsequent receptor activation [ 5053 ] . \n cetuximab is a valuable treatment option in head and neck patients as it synergizes with current treatment modalities . \n cetuximab enhances the effects of many standard cytotoxic agents , including cisplatin ( the conventional platinum - fluorouracil chemotherapeutic ) , and in combination with chemotherapy it can elicit antitumor responses in tumors that previously failed to respond to that chemotherapy . \n notably , cetuximab did not dramatically exacerbate the common toxic effects associated with radiotherapy of the head and neck , including mucositis , xerostomia , dysphagia , pain , weight loss , and performance status deterioration ....",

hold with retrospective electrocardiogram ( ecg ) gating can cover the entire heart with 1-mm slice thickness with a temporal resolution of 125 - 250 ms . \n when performed for coronary imaging , this method provides excellent opportunity to create , image reformation in any desired plane , including anatomically optimized long axis , short axis , or four -

these first adhesions are , however mechanically and biologically unstable . \n few minutes after this first , reversible phase , bacterial clusters attached to the surface starts to express biofilm related genes , produce glycocalyx and form mature biofilm , thus transforming the adhesion from reversible to irreversible 16 . \n full - formed biofilm can be found few hours after the first bacterial adhesion 17 . \n antimicrobial surface coatings can be based on an anti - adhesive principle that prevents bacteria to adhere and form biofilms 18 . \n in fact , some polymer coatings , like the hydrophilic polymethacrylic acid , polyethylene oxide or protein - resistant polyethylene glycol can be applied to the surface of titanium implants and result in significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion 19 - 22 . \n hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surface treatment technologies have also shown a great repellent antibacterial effect in preclinical studies 23 - 25 . \n however , clinical application of completely novel coating technologies and compounds , not otherwise previously tested in humans , appears particularly challenging 26 . \n bacterial colonization can also be blocked by an inhibitor interfering with ligand - receptor interaction for bacterial attachment . \n one of these inhibitors could be hyaluronic acid ( ha ) , a glycosaminoglycan made up of glucuronic acid and n - acetylglucosamine disaccharide units . \n it is a uniform , linear and unbranched molecule , with highly variable length and molecular weight ( up to 106 da ) . \n it is abundant in skin ( up to 56% ) and in connective tissues , with a turnover ranging from several hours to a few days depending on tissues . \n hyaluronic acid constitutes one of the main components of extracellular matrices . because of its biological properties , ha has several clinical applications ( aesthetic surgery , dermatology , dentistry , orthopedics and opthalmology ) 27 . \n extensive studies on the chemical and physicochemical properties of ha and its physiological role in humans , together with its versatile properties , such as its biocompatibility , non - immunogenicity , biodegradability , and viscoelasticity , have proved that it is an ideal biomaterial for medical and pharmaceutical applications 28 , 29 . among its various properties , \n several studies have recently shown the ability of ha to protect against various infectious agents 30 , depending on ha concentration and molecular weight 31 , 32 , while more recently ha interference on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation has been extensively investigated 33 . \n given its high biocompatibility and well known safety profile and the anti - adhesive capabilities , ha and its composites represent an attractive , non - antibiotic , option to mitigate the impact of biofilm - related infections in various clinical settings including implant - related infections . aim of this review is to provide an update of the current evidence concerning ha ability to reduce / prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation . \n nearly two decades ago , pavesio et al . 34 were probably the first to describe the ability of ha to resist bacterial adhesion , with particular reference to staphylococcus epidermidis , and its non - fouling properties 35 , proposing coated polymeric medical devices ( e.g. , intraocular lenses , stents and catheters ) to reduce implant - related infections . \n in particular , a hydrophilic ha overlayer , linked to the surface of polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lenses ( iols ) , was shown to be able to prevent fibroblasts adhesion and to greatly reduce staphyloccous epidermidis adhesion to the implant surface 36 . \n the impact of slime dispersants and anti - adhesives on in vitro biofilm formation on iols was further investigated by kadry and co - workers 37 , using a staphyloccous epidermidis wild strain , isolated from a patient with endophtalmitis ; the authors reported the ability of hyaluronan to reduce bacterial adhesion to iols to 30% , compared with untreated control cells . \n the authors suggested the use of adjuvant therapy such as dispersants or anti - adhesives , in addition to the antibiotics in irrigating solutions for bacterial ocular infections . \n more recently , the in vitro antiadhesive and antibiofilm activity of hyaluronic acid towards bacterial species commonly isolated from respiratory infections was investigated by drago et al . \n 33 . in this study , the interference exerted on bacterial adhesion was evaluated by using hep-2 cells , while the antibiofilm activity was assessed by means of spectrophotometry after incubation of biofilm with hyaluronic acid and staining with crystal violet . \n the experimental findings clearly demonstrated how hyaluronic acid is able to interfere with bacterial adhesion to a cellular substrate in a concentration - dependent manner . \n moreover , staphylococcus aureus biofilm was found to be more sensitive to the action of ha , compared to that produced by haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis . concerning more specifically the antimicrobial activity , ha \n has also been shown to exert varied bacteriostatic , but not bactericidal , dose - dependent effects on different microorganisms in the planktonic phase 31 , 38 . in this \n regard , radaeva et al . reported the inhibiting activity of ha with respect to some pseudomonas species 39 , while ardizzoni and co - workers 30 investigated the effects of ha on 15 atcc bacterial strains , representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species . \n their results showed that different microbial species and , sometimes , different strains belonging to the same species , are differently affected by ha . in particular , staphylococci , enterococci , streptococcus mutans , two escherichia coli strains , pseudomonas aeruginosa , candida glabrata and c. parapsilosis displayed a ha dose - dependent growth inhibition , while no ha effects were detected in e. coli atcc 13768 and c. albicans and s. sanguinis was favoured by the highest ha dose . comparing the potential bacteriostatic effect of some of the most commonly used biomatrix materials ( collagen type i , hyaluronic acid , hydroxyapatite , polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid ) on the growth over the first 12h of exposure of some of the most common orthopaedic bacterial pathogens ( staphylococcus aureus , staphylococcus epidermidis , -hemolytic streptococcus , pseudomonas aeruginosa ) , carlson and co - workers 38 found that ha had the most significant bacteriostatic properties on the studied organisms . \n 31 investigated the potential bacteriostatic effect of hyaluronic acid in different concentrations and molecular weight on oral and non - oral m...",

    "input": "ureterocele is a congenital urinary abnormality characterized by the presence of an intrabladder hernia or cystic ballooning of the lower end of a ureter lying between the mucosa and muscle of the bladder . \n the abnormality leads to urinary retention and recurrent urinary tract infection ( uti ) , which can cause irreversible damage to the kidney . \n this abnormality can be suspected in the fetus by antenatal ultrasonography ( usg ) and confirmed by other x - ray investigations after birth . \n the incidence of ureterocele is variable with the highest rate of 1:500 and it is generally found in females with duplex system association ( 95% ) . \n ureteroceles can have different clinical presentations , such as antenatal hydronephrosis , uti , vesicoureteral reflux ( vur ) , bladder outlet obstruction , prolapsed urethral mass , etc . \n usg and voiding cystourethrography ( vcug ) are essential initial procedures for a child suspected of having a ureteral anomaly . \n a 5-year - old female child was referred to our department for tc - diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ( dtpa ) scan . \n she was a follow - up case of right - sided hydroureteronephrosis with pyonephrosis with percutaneous tube ( pcn ) insertion done on the right side . \n patient 's blood urea and serum creatinine were 29 and 1.3 mg / dl , respectively . \n usg of the abdomen revealed left - sided mild hydroureteronephrosis and gross enlargement of the right kidney , reaching up to lower abdomen with dilated pelvis and ureter . \n the child was referred for evaluation of glomerular filtration rate and excretory function of kidneys . \n tc - dtpa scan was done in our department with right pcn tube in situ . \n pcn tube was clamped during the acquisition of dynamic and prevoid static image and clamp released thereafter . on tc - dtpa scan , left kidney showed good perfusion and adequate cortical radiotracer concentration followed by good drainage into dilated ureter . \n right ureter and right pelvicalyceal system ( pcs ) were visualized in the postvoid image ( indirect evidence of vur ) [ figure 2b , thin arrow ] . \n retention of radiotracer was noted in dilated pcs and dilated ureter in delayed static images acquired till 4 h [ figure 2c and d ] . \n faint visualization of radiotracer was noted through the pcn tube after removal of clamp [ figure 2b , bold arrow ] . \n a large photopenia was noted in the suprapubic region in the urinary bladder ( ub ) during dynamic [ figure 1 ] as well as delayed static images acquired till 4 h [ figure 2a  d ] . \n an usg of the abdomen was done in the radiology department of our hospital to find out the cause of this persistent photopenia in the ub . \n usg of the abdomen showed evidence of left - sided mild hydroureteronephrosis and grossly enlarged hydronephrotic right kidney with dilated right ureter and an intracystic ureterocele arising from the right side [ figure 3a and b ] . \n perfusion and dynamic images of 99mtc -

ureteric reflux ( thin arrow ) . \n ( c and d ) 3 and 4 h delayed static images showing persistent photopenia in the urinary bladder ( arrow marked ) ( a and b ) ultrasonography images depicting right ureterocele within the urinary bladder ( ub ) and dilated distal right ureter \n according to literature , 90% of the patients with ureterocele are diagnosed before the age of 3 years . \n most of the patients with ureterocele are classically diagnosed during the investigation for uti , asymptomatic hydronephrosis , and abdominal mass . \n although the age of diagnosis is decreasing , uti is still the most common clinical presentation of ureterocele in 50% of the patients promoting physician to make the thorough evaluation of the urinary system . \n the whole nephronourinary system could have already been negatively affected at the time of diagnosis . in our case , \n usg is an easy method to perform , noninvasive , and probably the best imaging modality for making the diagnosis . \n reflux can occur in the ipsilateral lower pole in almost half of the patients , but the contralateral system is also affected at a rate of 25% . the tc - dimercapto succinic acid ( dmsa ) scan should be undertaken routinely to assess the distribution of function in the duplex kidney and for detecting and follow - up of scarred tissue and nonfunctioning upper poles in cases of ureterocele . \n did a study on pediatric ureteroceles in 19 patients , on the diagnosis , management and treatment options . \n vcug was able to detect vur in 13 out of 17 patients ( 33% ) . \n dmsa scintigraphy showed ipsilateral renal scarring and nonfunctioning upper pole images in 7 out of 13 patients . computed tomography and mag3 scintigraphy \n did a study on the management of 36 patients with varied presentation of complicated ureteroceles . \n usg , micturating cystourethrogram , isotope renogram were done preoperatively in all the babies . in one of the cases , \n initial usg was unable to detect ureterocele in most of the cases in this study . \n they said that unless the usg is done in well - hydrated , cooperative patient , ureterocele is likely to be missed on usg . \n hence , an intravenous pyelogram , radioisotope renogram , and micturating cystourethrogram are invaluable in the complete understanding of ureterocele . in our patient also , the diagnosis of ureterocele was missed on initial usg . \n photopenia was noted in the ub on our scan , and this prompted us to investigate the patient further . \n possible causes for photopenic defects in the ub on nuclear scintigraphic studies include bladder papilloma , bladder polyp , carcinoma bladder , bladder calculus , foreign body in ub , intravesical ureterocele , etc . \n repeat usg revealed the cause of photopenia in ub in our case to be an intravesical ureterocele . on reviewing the literature we found that tc - dtpa scan is useful in the evaluation of renal function in patient with known ureteroceles . \n however , in our case on finding the photopenia in the ub on tc - dtpa scan , intravesical ureterocele was detected on usg . \n  \n ",

therefore , patients may be unaware of their presence . \n indeed , in studies based on the radiographic screening of populations , the incidence of all vertebral fractures has been estimated to be three times higher than the incidence of hip fractures , and only 30% of people with vertebral fractures were found to have received medical attention ( 12 ) . women with vertebral fractures can also experience decreased hrqol due to physical limitations and psychosocial disabilities ( 13 - 14 ) . \n some studies have assessed the impact of vertebral fractures on hrqol in older women in many countries ( 15,16 ) , but few such epidemiological studies have been conducted in brazil . \n moreover , most of the studies conducted in this country have been performed in ambulatory or institutionalized individuals ( 17,18 ) . \n therefore , this study evaluated the impact of vertebral fractures on the quality of life of healthy , community - dwelling women aged 65 years or older using the qualeffo . \n this study was performed using the framework of the so paulo ageing & health study ( spah ) , which was a population - based , cross - sectional study ( 9 ) . \n the inclusion and exclusion criteria were the same as those of the core study ( 9 ) . \n all of the individuals were apparently healthy and showed no evidence of malabsorption , chronic diarrhea , hepatic disease , severe chronic diseases , or cancer . \n current or previous bisphosphonate use was also an exclusion criterion ( 9 ) . quality of life was assessed through individual interviews using the validated qualeffo with 41 questions covering five domains : pain ( 5 questions ) , physical functioning ( 17 questions ) , social functioning ( sevn questions ) , general health perception ( three questions ) , and mental functioning ( nine questions ) ( 7 ) . \n the total score for each domain was obtained by summing the scores of all questions for that domain and submitting this sum to a linear transformation to a scale ranging from 0 to 100 , where 0 corresponds to the worst hrqol and 100 to the best hrqol . \n radiographs of the lumbar and thoracic spine centered on l2 and t7 , respectively , were obtained for all participants , with 40 \" between the tube and the film . \n the identification of vertebral fractures was performed by two individuals with experience in the field of analyzing vertebral fractures . \n they were blinded to each other 's assessments , and when the results conflicted , a consensus between the two individuals was reached . \n the agreement between the assessments of the two individuals was 96% , and the kappa coefficient was 0.82 . \n each identified fractured vertebra was assigned a grade based on the genant sq scale , where mild ( grade 1 ) corresponds to a 20 - 25% reduction in the anterior , middle , and/or posterior height ;

    "input": "the majority of women with menorrhagia , postcoital bleeding , intermenstrual bleeding , or postmenopausal bleeding ultimately undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy with endometrial sampling as part of their assessment , particularly if symptoms persist or pelvic imaging suggests a uterine abnormality . \n dilatation and curettage ( d&c ) has been widely considered to be the method of choice for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological evaluation \n . however , the needs for admission and general anesthesia and their associated costs have made this option less favorable . in the outpatient setting , endometrial sampling is an effective and acceptable method for obtaining endometrial samples for histopathological assessment [ 3 , 4 ] . \n inadequate sampling is more problematic in postmenopausal women , for whom up to 68% of endometrial samples are reported to be inadequate . in our institution , the only sampling tool available to perform the outpatient sampling procedure is the uterine explora model i - mx120 ( http://www.coopersurgical.com/ ) ( figure 1 ) . \n in addition , the device is sterile and disposable ( one - time use ) . \n the advantages of using explora rather than d&c as a sampling device include a reduction in hospitalization costs , extra convenience for the patient and physician , and the minimal complications of the procedure . \n the purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the explora model i tool with the conventional d&c technique for obtaining adequate endometrial samples that are capable of providing specific and informative histopathologic diagnoses . \n after obtaining the approval of our institutional review board , all endometrial samples received at the histopathology department in king khalid university hospital ( kkuh , riyadh , ksa ) between january 2007 and december 2010 were included in this study . a total of 1270 endometrial samples were included ( table 1 ) . \n two hundred seventy - four samples ( 21.6% ) were obtained by conventional d&c in the surgical theater , while the remaining 996 samples ( 78.4% ) were obtained by senior obstetrics and gynecology residents who used a standardized biopsy technique in the outpatient procedure rooms . during the usage of the explora model \n i , the syringe provided with the instrument was used to create a negative pressure , and the explora was rotated as it was withdrawn . after withdrawal , the tip was cut off , and the tissue was placed in 10% buffered formalin saline fixative and was sent for pathological examination . \n the pathologists who interpreted the endometrial samples were blinded to the instrument or method used to obtain the samples . \n an inadequate sample was defined as consisting of only blood , cervical mucus , endocervical epithelium , or blood with fragments of endometrial glands or stroma insufficient for histopathological assessment and diagnosis . \n the age , gravidity , parity , menstrual history , uterine size , hysteroscopy findings ( when available ) , and the presence or absence of any cervical abnormality were recorded on the request forms , which were reviewed by the investigators . for each of the two methods used ( explora model i and d&c ) , the numbers and percentages of inadequate samples and age group clustering were calculated and statistically analyzed . \n of the 1270 endometrial samples obtained , 253 samples ( 19.9% ) were scored as inadequate . of these samples , \n the explora sampler was used to collect 224 samples ( 88.5% ) , whereas 29 samples ( 11.5% ) were obtained by d&c ( figure 2 ) . \n thus , the insufficient tissue percentage was higher with the explora ( 17.6% ) than with d&c ( 2.2% ) , which was a statistically significant difference ( p < 0.0001 ) \n . age group clustering ( i.e. , numbers of premenopausal and postmenopausal women ) of inadequate sample results was also calculated ( figure 3 ) . of the 253 inadequate samples , \n 82.6% were from women 45 years of age and older ( i.e. , postmenopausal ) compared to 17.4% in premenopausal women ; the age difference was significant ( p < 0.0001 ) . \n the detection rates of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma using both methods were assessed and calculated . \n of the 73 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia , 50 ( 68.5% ) were diagnosed by d&c , and 23 ( 31.5% ) were diagnosed using the explora sampler . \n however , of the 18 samples with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer , the rates of detection were similar between the two methods . \n endometrial sampling for the evaluation of dysfunctional uterine bleeding and the diagnosis of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma and other indications remains one of the most commonly performed gynecological procedures [ 14 ] . in recent years \n , less hazardous and more inexpensive and convenient outpatient sampling methods have replaced the traditional , in - hospital , endometrial curettage . \n the advantages of outpatient endometrial biopsy include reduced cost and less risk for the patient , as no anesthesia is required . \n furthermore , the discomfort and pain produced by sampling have been reported to be minimal . \n however , it is essential to ensure that outpatient endometrial sampling is quantitatively adequate and comparably accurate to conventional dilatation and curettage . \n a sample is judged as adequate if a specific diagnosis can be given from the histological examination of the endometrial fragments obtained . \n adequacy can be measured by comparison of either outpatient biopsy with curettage histological evaluation or outpatient biopsy with the results of pathological examination of hysterectomy specimens [ 3 , 4 ] . \n many techniques for obtaining an endometrial sample without the need for curettage have been described in the literature . \n chicago , il , usa ) and the novak biopsy curette with a 10  ml syringe functioning as an aspiratory device , which have been shown to be equally effective compared to d&c in detecting an endometrial pathology [ 69 ] . \n however , the vabra aspirator and novak biopsy curette , although widely available and relatively inexpensive , have several disadvantages , including the need for an electric vacuum pump to perform the aspiration in the former technique and the pain caused by both methods . as a result of these drawbacks , smaller inexpensive and \n self - contained instruments have been developed and the prototype of this class of endometrial samplers is the pipelle . the pipelle has been shown to have a diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of vabra aspiration and the novak curettage while causing less pain [ 911 ] . \n all of these instruments ( i.e. , the vabra aspirator , the novak biopsy curette , and the pipelle ) have low rates of false - negative and insufficient tissue results for the detection of endometrial abnormalities , as determined by comparison to hysterectomy specimens [ 1113 ] . \n it was found that pipelle biopsy had a sensitivity of 99.2% in pinpointing high grade cancer and a sensitivity of 93% in detecting low grade malignancies ; the sensitivities defined for d&c were 100% and 97% , respectively . while \n excellent agreement  was generally noted between preoperative histology and grade and the final pathology , pre - operative endometrial sampling more commonly provided underestimates of final grade ( low grade versus high grade ) than overestimates . \n the explora is somewhat similar in its design to the pipelle , but clinical studies on its effectiveness are scarce , with the effectiveness ranging between 14.6 and 15% according to various studies [ 6 , 15 ] . \n our own findings revealed that the rate of obtaining inadequate samples using the explora was much higher ( 17.6% ) than the rates reported in the literature . \n however , most of these cases ( 82.6% ) were obtained from postmenopausal women with atrophic endometrial status . \n this finding is in keeping with the rates reported by other investigators [ 58 , 16 ] . \n this retrospective study suggests that traditional d&c produces better endometrial sample adequacy than the explora technique . \n this finding indicates that clinicians performing endometrial sampling would benefit from more experience and training using the explora technique . \n additional studies comparing the adequacy of samples obtained with different endometrial sampling techniques and devices are warranted . \n furthermore , we recommend using the d&c procedure when the explora - obtained samples are inconclusive or when the use of the explora sampler is accompanied by ultrasound findings that are suspicious of endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma .",

95% ci , 1.72728.667 ; p = 0.006 ) was the risk factor for functional lesions . \n as outlined above , incidental adrenal enlargement is detected with increasing frequency , most likely due to widespread increase in cross - sectional imaging , and is gradually emerging as a common clinical problem . \n our study shows that the proportion of incidental adrenal enlargement has gradually increased by year . \n mean age at diagnosis was 50.32 years , which is in line with other incidentally detected adrenal findings , namely , adrenal incidentaloma . \n the increasing age of the general population and a research trend towards more advanced investigations in the elderly population may be contributing to the high detection rate in this age group . \n our results indicate that , for the elderly patients , it is essential to place emphasis on these incidental findings . \n 's study   indicated that , of the total 64 patients , of which 40 ( 63% ) were men and 24 ( 37% ) were women , 43 ( 67% ) cases were bilateral enlargement and 21 ( 33% ) cases were unilateral . \n in addition , smooth enlargement was more common , in 53 ( 83% ) cases , and together these statistics reflect the likelihood that adrenal enlargement will be bilateral , smooth , and found in men . \n however , our study did not show this tendency , likely because the research goals and thus , study populations , differed between the 2 studies . \n 's study aimed to explore prevalence , while the present study aimed to evaluate functional status . \n in addition , patients enrolled in our study were hospitalized at the department of endocrinology . it should be noted that admitting was more or less selective , especially in tertiary referral hospitals , and that economic considerations in parts of china were still a problem . \n clinically , upon discovery of incidental adrenal enlargement , 2 issues arise : functionality and malignancy . in the relevant literature [ 48 ] , adrenal enlargement can result from endocrine disorders , such as adrenocorticotropic hormone- ( acth- ) dependent or independent cushing syndrome , pa , multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men-1 ) , and congenital adrenal hyperplasia . \n other potential causes include nonfunctional lesions , defined as a radiographic adrenal enlargement without clinical or biochemical manifestations , inflammation , neoplastic processes , obesity , or depression . \n 12 patients were found to have subclinical cushing syndrome ( originated from the adrenal gland ) and 6 patients were diagnosed with pa . however , the variety of disease spectrum in the study was only moderate , perhaps due , in part , to the limited number of included cases . \n it is important to note that even though reported prevalence was up to 11.3% , patient referrals to endocrinologists are relatively rare . \n this is likely related to the poor radiological awareness of this issue and its potential clinical significance . \n the clinical significance of lesion location and patient gender is smaller . in the present study , \n acth - independent macronodular hyperplasia ( aimah ) and primary pigmented nodular adrenal hyper...",

invasive project was approved by the research committee of hamadan medical university in january 2009 . \n it was also accepted by hamadan welfare organization , which is the responsible organization of kindergartens in hamadan . \n our methodology is briefly explained as follows . at first , a sub specialist in pediatric infectious diseases provides seven short texts about health and common pediatric infectious diseases prevention . \n then , a poet transfers these conceptions to childish poems for the first time ( appendix 1&2 ) . in the process of preparing an accurate questionnaire , at first 30 questions with three choices of \n ,  false  and  do not know  were made , but 24 items of those are confirmed as valid questions by two experts of health education and infectious diseases . to assess \n the reliability of the questionnaire a pilot study on a 40 participant sample was performed and cronbach 's alpha of the questionnaire was determined as 83 percent . \n in addition , we defined knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - tests . among 35 kindergartens in hamadan , we selected 7 kindergartens by simple random method . \n the parents ( either father or mother , the one who is responsible to take her / his child ) of all five to six year old children of the selected kindergartens are asked to participate in the survey and a verbal consent is obtained from those who accepted . \n we excluded the following children from our sample : those whose parents are physicians , nurses , health - care workers , and those children whose parents work at the kindergarten ( exclusion criteria ) . \n we asked the parents of the sample survey to participate in a pretest by answering to a questionnaire when they are in the kindergartens . \n also , they were asked to come to the kindergartens personally one more time when it is required ( to answer to the post test ) . then , we asked our kindergarten tutors to teach children seven musical poems about hydatid cyst , antibiotic misuse , botulinum toxin in home - canned foods , dysentery , the importance of sixth tooth , brucellosis and tetanus . in this step , children were not allowed to take home these texts , but they were asked to sing the poems at home and want their parents to re - write the poems on a paper and give them the papers to take to the kindergarten . \n the teaching stage took between three to four months . during the next stage , parents took a post - test survey with the same 24 questions . \n parents of 115 kids participated in the pre - test and 103 of them completed the post - test . \n statistical analysis is done on 103 who completed both tests by paired t - test . \n the sample data consists of 103 parents who provided solutions to both the pre- and post - test question survey . of the participants 77 were female and 26 male . from the level of education point of view \n , 19 were below high school diploma , 45 had high school diploma , 8 had associate degree , 27 had ba , 3 had ma , and 1 had phd . \n the results of the survey show a significant difference between the correct answers in both pre - test and post - test stages ( fig . \n 1 ) . the frequency of correct answers to the tests \n table 1 shows the mean of the correct answers in the pre - test stage is 59.22 while the same figure for the post - test step is 81 ( p < 0.001 ) . \n in addition , we define knowledge mark ( km ) as a parent mark in both the pre - test and/or post - test stages . the mean km shows a significant increase ( 5.01 ) from 13.62 in the pre - test to 18.63 in the post - test ( table 2 ) . \n mean percent of correct answers to pre - test and post - test categories \n  analyzed by paired t - test sd : standard deviation mean of knowledge mark in pre - test and post test analysed by paired t - test the difference of km promotion among females and males was not significant ( 21.6120.17 in males and 20.331.61 in females , p=0.8 ) . the km was increased to 19.9325.06 among parents who at most had high school diploma and 23.4720.84 among parents with upper educational levels ( p=0.5 ) . \n health has been the concern of poets such as fiona sampson for years , however , these poems never had educational purposes . the results of this study \n confirm our hypothesis about the role of children in raising family 's knowledge on health . \n the results show that neither gender nor the grade of knowledge degree ( below and upper high school diploma or below and upper ba ) affect answers . \n therefore , people with different educational status have received the information similarly implying that this method can be extended to general cases in a straightforward manner . \n 1 shows that the percentage of correct answers has increased in 23 out of 24 questions . \n the percent - age of correct answer to post - test has decreased only in one item ( item 11 ) which compares the risk of brucellosis transmission via unpasteurized milk and yogurt . although the term yogurt has not been mentioned directly in the related poem , but there is a hint about boiling mechanism and we expect that the audience discover the answer by logical thinking about the necessitation of boiling milk for preparing yogurt . \n the decrease in answering is 2 percent which is not significant ; however , it shows that it would be better to mention the conceptions directly in these types of poems in order to avoid any misconceptions . \n moreover , the percentage of correct answers to the questions of selected topics in pre - test and post - test has been compared ( table 1 ) and shows that parents have...",

investigation diagnosis was atypical shoulder pain and stiffness of non specific etiology in an immunocompromised patient and infection was part of the differential diagnosis not the only diagnosis . \n esenwein et al in his report highlighted the importance of early intervention to prevent chondral damage , osteomyelitis and also to prevent systemic spread . \n various authors have highlighted the importance of early diagnosis and management of septic arthritis failing which could lead to osteomyelitis and septic shock . in our patient \n , the diagnosis was delayed due to atypical presentation and over reliance on clinical findings at an outside center . \n we strongly recommend early imaging studies in immunocompromised patients presenting with shoulder pain and practitioners should avoid loosely diagnosing as shoulder pain with associated stiffness as frozen shoulders . \n klinger et al . did a retrospective study on 21 patients who underwent surgical treatment for septic arthritis of the shoulder joint between 2000 and 2007 , and he concluded that patients with symptoms for less than 2 weeks did well with arthroscopic approach and early infection can be managed arthroscopically . \n our reports show that arthroscopic washout can give good result even after 2 weeks of clinical symptoms if there is no evidence of osteomyelitis . \n septic arthritis of the shoulder is very often due to hematogenous spread and diagnosis is often clinical . \n laboratory investigations and imaging studies like mri and usg may be useful in establishing the diagnosis but confirmation is usually by joint aspiration . \n patients who are immunocompromised and have insidious onset of moderate to severe pain and which fails to respond to trial of conservative treatment should be subjected to either ultrasound or mri instead of x - ray because very often in these group of patients it is primarily a soft tissue pathology like impingement , rc tear , calcific tendinitis or rarely infections and malignancies . \n we recommend that moderate pain of more than 4 weeks duration with severe stiffness in immunocompromised patient ( liver cirrhosis , renal failure , steroid treatment ) should be further evaluated with mri or ultrasound in the setting of normal x - ray and should not be loosely diagnosed as frozen shoulder . \n goldenberg in his report emphasized the role of local as well as systemic factors that predispose patients with cirrhosis to gram - negative bacterial joint infections . \n malnick also reported a case of spontaneous septic arthritis in a cirhottic patient that was due to e.coli . \n our study as well as other studies by goldenberg and malnick highlight the importance of including broad spectrum antibiotics with gram negative cover whilst waiting for final culture sensitivity . \n septic arthritis of shoulder may not present with classic clinical features . a through clinical and radiological evaluation should be executed and treatment initiated promptly to prevent complications like septic shock and osteomyelitis . \n the case highlights the importance of establishing anatomical and pathological diagnosis using mri in patients with shoulder pain instead of loosely diagnosing them as impingement or frozen shoulder . \n the case also challenges the practice of routine shoulder depomedrol steroid injection , in the setting of secondary frozen shoulder , atleast in immunocompromised individuals . \n primary idiopathic frozen shoulder is a rare condition and secondary frozen shoulder cases are often due to underlying shoulder pathology .",

    "input": "split - liver   transplantation ( slt ) is an   attractive alternative procedure to expand the donor pool in patients waiting for liver transplantation . \n the standard split - liver procedure for a child and an adult ( adult / pediatric split liver ttransplantation , a / p slt ) , by splitting segment ii - iii for pediatric recipient and segment i - iv - v - vi - vii - viii for an adult , is an accepted surgical option with good results both for the adult and for pediatric recipient . \n biliary complications continue to be the major cause of morbidity after slt with a reported high incidence ranging between 10% and 32% [ 1 , 2 ] . as a consequence of bile duct anatomic variations \n , slt requires a precise knowledge of the liver anatomy [ 3 , 4 ] . \n the challenge of this procedure is represented by a preoperative radiological assessment of the biliary anatomy often unavailable at the donor 's hospital . \n thus the risk of biliary duct injury during the splitting procedure is usually considered higher than during living donor procedure .   in this report \n we describe an uncommon late biliary complication that occurred after slt and was successfully treated by a multidisciplinary approach . \n a 63-year - old male with hepatitis c - related cirrhosis was referred for liver transplantation to our institution . \n we performed a conventional a / p slt with in situ technique providing the left lateral segment for a child ( segments ii - iii ) and leaving the right lobe graft ( segment i - iv - v - vi - vii - viii ) for an adult recipient . \n the celiac trunk was left on the left graft while the right hepatic artery remained on the right graft . \n the patient was transplanted using the piggy - back technique without a veno - venous bypass . \n the biliary tract was reconstructed performing a duct - to - duct anastomosis using a t - tube by our standard technique previously described . \n a cholangiography through the t - tube was performed on postoperative day 14 , and the t - tube was clamped before patient discharge . \n three months after a / pslt the t - tube was removed after a cholangiography with normal findings . \n one year after transplant the patient showed abnormal liver function tests , hyperbilirubinemia , leukocytosis , and elevated g - glutamyl transpeptidase ( ggt ) , and mild elevation in alanine transaminase ( alt ) . \n the patient underwent a doppler ultrasound that showed ( a patent hepatic artery )   an intrahepatic bile duct dilatation and an anastomotic biliary stricture . \n the anastomotic stricture was treated by stenting the main biliary duct during an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatoghaphy ( ercp ) without any evidence of intrahepatic biliary dilatation . \n after this procedure the patient was submitted to a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography ( ptc ) showing a complete obstruction of segments vi and vii biliary branches near the duct - to - duct biliary anastomosis ( figure 1 ) . \n the patient was discharged leaving the external biliary drain open allowing bile drainage and an easy access for repeated radiologic treatment and an internal stent in the common bile duct . \n three months later the patient underwent a surgical revision because of repeated episodes of cholangitis . during surgery \n an intraoperative cholangiography was performed through the biliary drain   confirming a bile duct dilatation at the level of segments vi and vii . \n it was impossible to cross the biliary stricture by a torque catheter and by hydrophilic guide wire ( figure 2 ) . \n we supposed that the segmentary bile duct branch of   posterior segments vi and vii draining in the left bile duct was unidentified and tied at the time of the in situ split - liver procedure during the parenchymal transection . \n a primary biliary reconstruction by biliary repair or biliodigestive anastomosis was considered at high risk because of the presence of postsurgical   adhesions   sand due to fibrotic tissue replacing   the parenchymal transected area . a liver resection of the dilated segments vi and vii was considered at high risk of leaving an inadequate liver mass . \n we decided to perform a permanent intraoperative obliteration of the dilated intrahepatic ducts by a percutaneous embolization using a nonresorbable agent . with a fluoroscopic guidance through the transhepatic access we positioned a 5-french polyethylene catheter inside the ducts , preliminary flushed by a nonionic dextrose solution . \n we then injected the tissue adhesive agent n - butyl cyanoacrylate ( nbca , glubran 2 , gem , viareggio , italy ) mixed with ionized oil ( lipiodol , guebert , aulnay - sous - bois , france )   for opacization in a ratio of 1:5 . \n this solution completely filled the biliary duct , and the occlusion was totally accomplished in a few seconds ( figure 3 ) . during the first 3 days after the chemical bile duct embolization , the patient had a low fever with a slightly abnormal liver function test . \n a computed tomography ( ct ) scan performed 6 months later showed no sign of hepatic abscesses , and the bile duct dilatation was completely occupied by the nbca - lipiodol mixture . \n one year after the procedure patient showed normal liver function tests without no episodes of cholangitis . \n chemical bile duct embolization treatment could represent a valuable   solution to treat uncommon biliary complications . \n these tissue adhesive glues are low - viscosity liquid monomers that undergo rapid polymerization and solidification when they come into contact with organic fluids such as bile . \n nbca is a permanent liquid embolic material that produces long - term occlusion in vessels of various size through an inflammatory tissue response resulting in vessel thrombosis or tissue   atrophy . \n little is known about the use of cyanoacrylate compounds , and unlike european countries   the use of glubran has not been approved by the food and drug administration yet . \n other authors have described the efficacy of biliary duct ablation by nbca in patients with persistent postsurgical bile leaks after lobectomy or cholecystectomy . \n vu et al . treated six patients with persistent postsurgical bile leaks as a complication after hepatic lobectomy or cholecistectomy using nbca glue for the obliteration of isolated segmental bile ducts in four cases . \n endoscopic treatment of biliary leakage by nbca has been described by seewald in nine patients in whom primary stent placement or nasobiliary drain was unsuccessful . \n described the use of a cyanoacrlylate in the treatment of a pancreatic fistula after distal pancreatectomy . \n the percutaneous interventional technique represents an effective valuable approach to reduce mortality and morbidity in the treatment of biliary complications after liver transplantation . \n the use of nbca in obliteration of a dilated bile duct seems to be a safe procedure with good results providing a less invasive option than hepatic resection above all in high -

    "input": "ribonucleotide reductase ( rr ) inhibitors have been studied as radiation sensitizers for over 30  years in both the lab and the clinic . \n the first of these , hydroxyurea , has been studied in both cervical and head and neck cancers , among others . \n although initially promising , many of the clinical trials produced negative results , or those that were difficult to interpret . there has recently been a significant advance in our understanding of this pathway from a number of well - done pre - clinical studies . \n in addition , the discovery of new rr inhibitors with increased potency and improved binding characteristics has produced a significant increase in interest in this area . \n this review will synthesize the data detailing the response of rr to ionizing radiation ( ir ) and will provide a perspective on the use of rr inhibitors as radiosensitizers in the treatment of human cancers . over the years , many groups have explored the use of rr inhibitors as chemotherapeutics in their own right , or as adjuncts to dna damaging molecules , particularly in hematologic malignancies . while this area looks promising , this subject will not be reviewed here . \n ribonucleotide reductase is the rate limiting enzyme in the synthesis and repair of dna and is the only enzyme responsible for the conversion of ribonucleoside diphosphates to deoxyribonucleotide diphosphates , the fundamental building blocks of dna synthesis and repair . \n r1 ( also called rrm1 or m1 ) is the larger , regulatory subunit that is constitutively expressed throughout the cell cycle . \n it binds allosteric modulators , ribonucleoside diphosphates , and the nucleoside analogs gemcitabine and fludarabine . \n there are currently two known smaller subunits that bind r1 to form the active enzyme ; r2 ( also called rrm2 or m2 ) and a more recently discovered p53 inducible homolog of the r2 subunit , known as p53r2 . \n both contain a tyrosine free radical stabilized by a non - heme iron complex that is critical in the reduction of ribonucleotides . \n r2 is known to be cell cycle regulated , with the highest levels during s phase , however the precise roles of the r2 and p53r2 subunit in the response to ir are an area of active debate , as outlined below ( figure 1 ) . \n given the pivotal role of rr in dna synthesis and repair , many studies have investigated the effect of dna damaging agents , including ir , on rr and its subunits . \n even so , there is currently still a great deal of controversy surrounding the exact mechanism of rr response to ir . \n the first is that the small subunit r2 is up - regulated and provides dntps for dna repair in addition to its usual role in dna synthesis during s phase . \n this is supported by a number of studies , including one by kuo et al . , who characterized the response of rr in the human cervical cancer cell line , caski . \n they demonstrated an increase in r2 protein levels after treating cells with ir , which was correlated with an increase in rr activity . \n however , there was no increase in the transcription of r2 , implying that the protein increase was due to post - transcriptional regulation ( kuo and kinsella , 1998 ) . \n this finding was reinforced by studies that demonstrated dna damage dependent stabilization of the r2 protein without any change in mrna after ir exposure in mouse balb/3t3 cells ( chabes and thelander , 2000 ) ; however it was in contrast to earlier work showing transcriptional activation of the r1 and r2 promoters after exposure to ir in the same cell line ( filatov et al . , 1996 ) . even though the precise mechanism of r2 response to ir damage is unclear , work has shown that human nasopharyngeal cancer cells overexpressing r2 demonstrate a significant increase in radioresistance and fewer dna double strand breaks ( dsb ) after exposure to ir ( kuo et al . , 2003 ) , confirming the concept that r2 is important in the cellular response to ir \n the second theory involves the p53 inducible subunit , p53r2 , first reported by tanaka et al . \n they showed that p53r2 was not cell cycle regulated ( unlike r2 ) , but was significantly induced after exposure of normal fibroblasts to ir ( tanaka et al . , 2000 ) and was found to translocate to the nucleus , the proposed site of most important dntp production ( r2 did not ) . in cells that lacked wild - type ( wt ) p53 , \n there was no induction , indicating that functional p53 was necessary for p53r2 up - regulation . \n cells transfected with p53r2 were resistant to dna damage induced cell death . in agreement with other studies , they found no increase in r2 mrna , but did not measure protein levels . \n additional studies have subsequently shown that p53r2 forms an active complex with r1 ( guitett et al . , 2001 ) and \n rr activity increased in correlation with the increase in p53r2 , however the response of r2 was variable , with decrease in some lines and a moderate increase in the others ( yamaguchi et al . , 2001 ) . \n finally , other models are possible , including one described by xue and colleagues . in their study , both subunits were found to bind p53 in human oropharyngeal carcinoma cells , and in response to ir , were released to bind r1 in the nucleus ( xue et al . , 2003 ) , highlighting a third possibility in contrast to those previously presented . \n clearly , there is still work to be done in elucidating the response of rr to ir . \n many of the differences seen in the studies discussed can likely be attributed to the use of different techniques , materials , and especially cell lines . \n what should be clear is that rr is involved in the cellular response to ir and targeting it is both rational and likely desirable in enhancing the treatment of cancers with ir . \n it is likely that both r2 and p53r2 are involved to a different degree in different cancers , with cellular phenotype likely playing a key role in determining their relative significance . \n hydroxyurea ( hu ) is a hydroxylated analog of urea and was the first rr inhibitor to be extensively studied . \n it has directed activity at the tyrosine radical moiety of r2 and was first found to be active against cancer cells in 1963 ( stearns et al . , 1963 ) . \n subsequent experiments in vitro showed that in addition to its direct inhibition of dna synthesis , it was also a sensitizer of cell killing by x - rays , particularly if given before or after ir ( sinclair , 1968 ) . \n later experiments showed that this was also the case in in vivo animal tumor models using isotransplants of spontaneous c3h / he mouse mammary carcinomas ( piver et al . , 1972 ) . \n the total dose of ir to cure 50% of tumors was reduced when hu was combined with fractionated ir , although this effect was nt seen with single fraction ir treatments . given these encouraging pre - clinical results during the 19601970s , \n hu was subsequently examined in a number of clinical trials in a variety of human cancers . \n the majority of these trials have occurred in cervical cancer , most commonly in locally advanced disease . in particular , there were a number of prospective randomized controlled trials in the 1970s and 1980s that examined the effect of hu plus radiotherapy vs. radiotherapy alone . \n and the gynecologic oncology group ( gog ) enrolled 190 women with figo stage iiib or iva cervical carcinoma . \n hu was administered orally at 80  mg / kg starting on the first day of irradiation and every 3  days thereafter for 12  weeks . \n patients received at least 50  gy minimum tumor dose to the whole pelvis followed by a single brachytherapy treatment of 20  gy to point a. in spite of the large number of patients enrolled , only 90 were eligible for assessment of response . \n this was due to ineligibility ( wrong stage , wrong cell type , etc . ) and those that were inevaluable ( refused treatment , periaortic node irradiation , improper field , etc . ) . \n the data were impressive , with a complete response ( cr ) of 68.1% in the hu group vs. 48.8% in the placebo ( p  =  <  0.05 ) , and a median progression free survival ( pfs ) of 13.6 vs. 7.6  months ( hreshchyshyn et al . , 1979 ) . however , myelosuppression was more common in the hu group , with seven grade iii or iv myelotoxicities . \n they recruited 148 women with figo iib or iiib cervical carcinoma and again compared hu to placebo in the setting of conventional radiotherapy , with hu given every 3  days for 12  weeks . \n of the stage iib patients , 74% receiving hu had no evidence of disease at the completion of therapy compared with 43.5% of the placebo ( p  =  <  0.01 ) . \n of the stage iiib patients , the cr rates were 52.5 vs. 33% ( p  =  0.22 ; piver et al . , 1977 ) . \n again , 78% of patients in the hu group developed leucopenia vs. 11% in the placebo group indicating a significant toxicity in addition to the improved clinical effect . at the time these studies were published \n , it was felt that hu added significant benefit to the treatment of local...",

    "input": "the value of the ketogenic diet ( kd ) has been recognized in the treatment of epilepsy , although the exact mechanisms by which it exerts its effect remain an enigma . \n they seem to be different from those of regular antiepileptic medications ( aeds ) , and discovering what they are may lead to its use in clinical situations other than epilepsy as well . \n the kd is comprised of four elements , the changes of any of them can potentially lead to losing its anticonvulsant effect : ( 1 ) increased amount of fat , usually in a ratio of 3 to 4 grams of fat for each gram of protein and carbohydrates , ( 2 ) as low a consumption of glucose as possible , ( 3 ) caloric restriction , and ( 4 ) fluid restriction . \n although there is some debate about the last component , clinical practice has shown that stopping fluid restriction can lead to seizure recurrence much in the same way as when stopping glucose restriction . \n the most important result of observing the diet is the increased blood level of free fatty acids ( ffas ) . \n the ffas are transferred into the mitochondria , a process which requires the presence of an appropriate amount of carnitine , where they are degraded into ketone bodies through  oxidation . \n these ketone bodies include  hydroxybutyrate , acetoacetate , and acetone   ( figure 1 ) . \n the effect of the increased amount of ketone bodies seems to be the most prominent of all other suggested antiepileptic mechanisms of the kd . \n the degradation of the ketone bodies delivers acetyl - coa directly to the tricarboxylic acid cycle , thus increasing its turnover while bypassing the need to depend on acetyl - coa coming from glycolysis to produce atp . unlike glucose , which requires a transporter to cross the blood brain barrier , \n the ketone bodies penetrate it easily . when this transporter is deficient , as in glut 1 deficiency , the kd is the preferred way of antiepileptic treatment , since it allows for bypassing the need for glucose . \n children in whom the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl - coa is blocked , for instance , in pyruvate dehydrogenase ( pdh ) deficiency , will also benefit from bypassing this route . \n hydroxybutyrate is the predominant ketone body measured in the blood , and it is used to monitor the degree of ketosis during therapy . \n the breath of a patient who is ketotic while on the diet will often even smell of acetone . \n acetone is one of the ketone bodies that have an anticonvulsant effect in several types of mouse seizure models . \n the mechanism of this effect is unknown , although an effect on k2p channels has been proposed .   by means of the tca cycle , \n acetyl - coa increases the level of the neurotransmitters glutamate and -aminobutyric acid ( gaba ) and the major excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in brain , respectively . \n another product of an elevated level of free fatty acids is polyunsaturated fatty acids ( pufas ) . \n the potential ability of pufas to block seizure activity in the brain is speculated to be associated with some rather more complicated mechanisms , including ( 1 ) directly inhibiting voltage - gated sodium and calcium channels , ( 2 ) activating a lipid - sensitive potassium channel , ( 3 ) enhancing the activity of the sodium pump to limit neuronal excitability , ( 4 ) activating peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor- ( ppar ) , and ( 5 ) inducing the expression and activity of brain - specific uncoupling proteins in the mitochondria , thereby inducing a neuroprotective effect . \n neuroprotection can contribute to the anticonvulsant effect , but it may have other effects as well , which can lead to other clinical uses of the kd . \n appleton and de vivo   reported that the kd increased the total quantity of bioenergetic substrates ( adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) ) and elevated the energy charge in rat brain . \n acetoacetate , a product of  hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenation , is transferred into acetyl - coa which enters the tricarboxylic acid ( tca ) cycle . \n the increased turnover of the tca cycle generates protons and electrons that are channeled to the electron transport chain . \n this , in turn , drives the formation of atp from adenosine phosphate ( adp ) by atp synthase . \n enhanced atp can either be converted to phosphocreatine for energy storage or broken into adenosine . \n enhanced atp levels provide energy reserves for a neuron to continue functioning under stress . increased extracellular adenosine offers a neuroprotective buffer against insults , reduces excitation , and averts excessive atp demands , thus providing local seizure control and neuroprotection . \n it was also suggested that the kd influences toward an upregulation of transcripts encoding energy metabolism enzymes and increase in the density of mitochondria in neuronal process , leading to heightened energy reserves . \n an improved energetic status can support seizure prevention , for instance , by supporting gabaergic inhibition . \n it is suggested that adaptive processes to the metabolic changes induced by the diet lead to changes in gene expression which in turn result in some of the above - noted changes . \n other path of neuroprotection is modulated through decreased generation of ros which is considered to be related to pufas effect on uncoupling proteins . \n the fact that the kd is considered a proven therapy with relatively few adverse affects and wide clinical experience , particularly in children , led to recent studies investigating new potential uses for other neurological disorders . \n one of the most intriguing and active fields of research is the effect of a high - fat caloric - restricted diet on the survival of brain tumors cells . \n it is hypothesized that mitochondrial abnormalities impair the ability of brain tumors to generate energy from ketone bodies . unlike normal cells , \n malignant tumor cells have impaired genetic adaptability due to their genetic abnormalities and , therefore , increased susceptibility to environmental stress , such as fasting or caloric restriction . \n the same genomic defects that are involved in the creation of brain tumors can be exploited for their destruction [ 3 , 10 , 11 ] .   in 1995 , nebeling et al \n .   reported two young girls with unresectable advanced stage brain tumors who had poor response to radiation and chemotherapy . \n they were treated with a kd and their response was remarkable , both clinically and according to positron emission tomography follow - up scans . \n described a patient with glioblastoma multiforme whose tumor , which is very malignant , improved on the kd . surprisingly , despite the appealing efficacy of this treatment , no further human studies or clinical trials on the kd as a therapy for brain tumors have been conducted . \n several laboratory studies in mouse and rat models have recently confirmed that inhibition of brain tumor growth is directly related with reduced levels of glucose and elevated levels of ketone bodies . \n moreover , the kd was shown to reduce reactive oxygen species ( ros ) in the brain . \n cancer cells need high levels of ros for the induction of angiogenesis and the production of tumor growth factors , thus , through this mechanism the kd can be protective . \n the clinical manifestations were mainly intractable seizures that necessitated repeated admissions to the intensive care unit , as well as severe cognitive and alertness decline . \n after the oncologists decided that antitumor treatment would be ineffective , she was started on the kd . \n after four weeks of trial , it did not have any effect on the tumor progression . \n however , it did have a notable improving effect on cognition , alertness , and mood of the girl , in spite of her devastating condition . \n the beneficial effect of the kd on cognition , alertness , and mood is well recognized , and clinical experience shows that in many times it is not less important than the anticonvulsant effect . \n the potential neuroprotective effect of the kd was what motivated investigations into its potential as a treatment option in other neurologic disorders . \n there are increasing numbers of reports that ketosis achieved by starvation or administration of a kd has a consistent neuroprotective effect after various brain injuries in animal models . \n one human pilot study and several animal model studies have shown improvement in autistic behavior parameters with kd treatment . \n it remains to be further clarified whether this improvement is related to reduced epileptic activity found in up to 30% of these patients or to a primary effect of the kd . \n a factor that can be crucial for the application of the kd in medical conditions other than intractable epilepsy is the inherent difficulties in its use . \n dietary restriction can pose a significant problem in a child with a progressive tumor that undergoes massive chemotherapy , who may already be cachectic . \n the kd may not be an option in a grown - up hyperact...",

guenin 2008 ; moller 2009 ) . \n even if using human embryos for stem cell research is deemed permissible , ethical issues continue to emerge as new social practices and roles develop around the act of embryo donation . \n the relative novelty of these practices and roles , complicated by the pace of change in technical possibility and regulation , mean that there is still uncertainty about how to conceptualise embryo donation , not just in terms of systematic ethics but as a sociomoral practice in everyday social life and morality ( banks , scully , and shakespeare 2006 ) . from a sociological perspective , and also to understand more generally how everyday morality deals with unprecedented ethical dilemmas , it is important to examine which conceptualisations emerge as salient and how they are stabilised and used . \n for example , one way of thinking about the donation of embryos to research is as a bodily gift relationship , one of the many established by modern biomedicine such as the donation of eggs and sperm for reproductive purposes , organs or tissues for transplantation , blood for transfusion , and other biological tissues for research . \n drawing analogies to existing practices in this way has proved helpful in other instances of bioethical novelty ( hofmann , solbakk , and holm 2006 ) . \n however , analogies can equally well be misleading , if there are morally relevant but unacknowledged differences between situations . \n the contexts in which different organs and tissues are donated vary significantly , and these differences influence the sociomoral understanding of donation in each case and make them noncomparable in ethical terms \n . reproductive tissue , for example , is generally distinguished from other types of donated tissue because eggs , sperm , and embryos have the potential to give rise to new individuals , not just to prolong the lives of existing individuals , or to be used for research . because embryos are generally considered to have a different moral status from other tissues , the use of surplus embryos in research raises moral unease about the instrumentalization of human life that is not raised in quite the same way by the donation of either ova or sperm . \n it is therefore unclear whether an embryo can meaningfully be treated as a  gift  (  donation  ) without blurring the morally relevant differences between embryos and other tissues . \n similarly ,  hesc research ,  to which the embryo may be given , is a domain of biomedical practices and not an entity . as such \n , hesc research is not a subject with which a gift relationship can be established ( unlike , for instance , an organ recipient ) . \n understanding the social and ethical meanings that are emerging for the practices associated with embryo donation calls for a detailed empirical examination of people s reasoning behind donation decisions . \n however , most empirical studies of embryo donation have not focused on people s donation rationales in depth ( with some exceptions ; for example , haimes et al . 2008 ; de lacey 2003 ) . \n the scarcity of data on donor rationales means there is a corresponding lack of information on contextual and other factors that influence donor decisions and how these can be related to the evaluations of theoretical ethics . \n the authors of this paper have been involved in a series of linked qualitative studies of practices of embryo donation , first in the united kingdom ( researcher haimes and colleagues ) , then switzerland ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz ) , and in a smaller pilot project in china ( mitzkat , rehmann - sutter , and haimes ) . \n all three studies shared an interest in understanding reasons for the donation or non - donation of embryos . while the studies in switzerland and china drew upon the original u.k . \n design , each study was conducted independently , and the details of each project , including interview design , differed in light of the varying regulatory , clinical , and cultural contexts . however , by looking across the three data sets , we hope to gain cross - cultural insights into donation and non - donation rationales and the moral understandings on which they are based . \n the three studies all used open - ended , semi - structured , one - off interviews between the researcher and people who had been in the position of deciding whether to donate their surplus embryos to research . \n interviews were designed to explore in depth not just the interviewees decision about donation but also the background to that decision , such as their ivf story , their family and other relationships , their relationship with the clinic and its staff , and so on . \n the interviews were transcribed , coded , and initially analysed to identify the reasons for donation decisions given by participants in each study , using an interpretative approach that all of us have previously found useful for identifying key themes around decision - making and implicit or explicit ethical judgements ( charmaz 2006 ; smith , flowers , and larkin 2009 ) . \n study ran for more than three years ; after some familiarisation and observation in the collaborating clinic , 44 in - depth interviews were conducted with couples who had been asked to donate their surplus fresh embryos , generated through ongoing ivf treatment , to hesc research ( haimes and taylor 2009 ) . in the united kingdom , it has been possible for some years to donate unused embryos to stem cell and other kinds of research and also to other couples . \n the swiss study was carried out shortly after a change in the law that permitted fresh or cryopreserved surplus ivf embryos , under strictly defined conditions , to be donated to stem cell research only . in this study , 17 individuals who had variously chosen to donate or not to donate were interviewed ; thus , the decision concerned the fate of cryopreserved embryos some time after the ivf treatment that had produced them ( scully , rehmann - sutter , and porz 2010 ) . the chinese work involved a much smaller three - month pilot study carried out in a large art hospital . \n it was designed as a pilot to provide a comparison with the u.k . and swiss material and is , therefore , included here despite the low number of participants , but with no attempt to draw general conclusions from it . \n legislation in china does not allow the donation of embryos to other couples , but consent can be given for a surplus embryo to be used in stem cell research or for it to be discarded . \n the study included participant observation of the information and consent procedures and qualitative interviews with five ivf patients , three choosing to donate to stem cell research and two refusing ( mitzkat , haimes , and rehmann - sutter 2010 ) . \n for the purposes of this paper , the authors involved in the studies jointly compared the rationales for donation decisions given by their participants . \n we also independently reexamined interview transcripts for material relevant to the discussion of gratitude . in the rest of this paper , we first identify and compare the main reasons given by participants in these three studies for their decisions to donate or to refuse to donate their surplus embryos to research . \n we then look in more detail at the implications of our findings for one area of potential ethical concern : the possible role of gratitude in making embryo disposition decisions . in this way \n , we not only collect empirical data to help understand the emerging moral meaning of a new practice , but also give an example to show how empirical data can be used to question and then refine the conceptual basis of bioethical theory . \n participants who chose to donate their surplus embryos to research had a backgr...",

    "input": "thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine neoplasia which accounts for about 1% of human cancers . \n mtc originates from calcitonin - producing cells ( c - cells ) of the thyroid gland and accounts for 35% of thyroid cancers . \n mtc is relatively slow - growing tumor but , if metastasized or relapsed , it becomes very aggressive causing more than 13% of all thyroid cancer - related mortality . in the united states , \n mtc has an incidence in children of 0.03 per 100 000 population per year with a fairly equal female to male ratio [ 4 , 5 ] . \n mtc occurs either sporadically or in an inherited autosomal dominant manner . in adults , sporadic mtc accounts for 6575% of mtc , but in children , \n sporadic mtc is very rare ; the vast majority of mtc diagnosed in the childhood is hereditary . \n hereditary mtc occurs as a familial mtc ( fmtc ) or as a part of multiple endocrine neoplasia ( men ) type 2a and b syndromes , wherein other endocrine glands are also affected . \n mtc diagnosed during childhood almost always results from a dominantly inherited or de novo activating mutations in the ret proto - oncogene , which encodes the ret receptor tyrosine kinase [ 69 ] . \n advances in predictive genetic testing for ret mutations have enabled early diagnosis of hereditary men syndromes and prophylactic thyroidectomy in presymptomatic patients to prevent mtc . \n the early onset of mtc in hereditary syndromes makes it an important endocrine disease that is increasingly managed by pediatric providers [ 1012 ] . in this review \n , we discuss the etiology of pediatric mtc and currently available therapeutic modality for the cancer . \n ret encodes a receptor tyrosine - kinase which is expressed in the neural crest - derived cell types , including thyroid parafollicular cells , neuronal cells , and adrenal medullary chromaffin cells . in these cell types \n , ret plays a central role in regulating cell proliferation , growth , differentiation , migration and survival . in humans \n after alternative splicing at the 3 end , ret transcripts encode three protein isoforms with distinct c - terminal ends that contain either 9 ( ret9 ) , 51 ( ret51 ) , or 43 ( ret43 ) amino acids . \n ret exon 19 is present in all transcripts and its differential splicing at the 3 end produces distinct transcripts wherein exon 19 is either unspliced , spliced to exon 20 , or spliced to exon 21 . \n all three resulting ret isoforms commonly contain a tyrosine ( tyr1062 ) whose phosphorylation is critical for their activation . \n the major ret isoforms in vivo are ret9 and ret51 , which consist of 1072 and 1114 amino acids , respectively , and are usually co - expressed . \n ret consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain , a trans - membrane domain , and an intracellular kinase domain ( figure 1 ) . \n the extracellular domain includes four cadherin - like repeats and a highly conserved cysteine - rich region , which is located near the cell membrane . \n the intracellular domain consists of two tyrosine - kinase subdomains , tk1 and tk2 , which contain multiple tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated during receptor activation and are required for the activation of different downstream signaling pathways of ret [ 19 , 20 ] . \n the ligands for ret are the glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor ( gdnf ) family proteins , including gdnf , neurturin , artemin , and perseptin . \n activation of ret also requires the formation of a heterodimeric complex recruiting a gdnf - family receptor alpha ( gfr ) . when unbound by a ligand , ret is monomeric , unphosphorylated , and inactive . \n when a ligand and the gfr co - receptor bind to the extracellular domain of ret , ret undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues in their kinase domains . \n this generates the docking sites for their downstream effectors that contain the src homology 2 domain . \n for example , gdnf - mediated stimulation of ret results in activation of the pathways regulated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( pi3k ) and different mitogen - activated protein kinases ( mapks ) , including the extracellular regulated kinases ( erks ) , c - jun amino - terminal protein kinases ( jnks ) , the p38 mapk and the big map kinase ( bmk1 ) erk5 [ 22 , 23 ] . \n ret is one of the first receptor tyrosine - kinases ( rtks ) that have been found to play a role in neoplasia , being most well - known as a key etiological factor for thyroid cancer [ 6 , 24 ] . activating mutations of ret \n abnormally enhance ret activity and can trigger tumorigenesis in certain organs although the exact underlying mechanisms are as of yet unclear . \n first , mutations of the six cysteine residues ( cys609 , 611 , 618 , 620 , 630 , and 634 ) in the extracellular domains can promote ret dimerization via disulfide bonds and result in constitutive ligand - independent activation of ret . \n second , mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase domains can also confer ligand - independent catalytic activity to monomeric ret . \n these ret mutants exhibit different patterns of autophosphorylation and altered substrate specificity [ 2628 ] . indeed , \n activation of different downstream signaling pathways is associated with different clinical features of ret mutant thyroid cancers , as observed in men2 syndromes discussed below . \n for example , the hirschprung disease , a congenital disorder of neural crest development is caused by a loss - of - function ret mutation . \n of note , the hirschprung disease is closely associated with men2a , demanding a genetic screening for men2a for children with familial hirschsprung 's disease . \n a strict correlation exists between specific ret mutations and the onset of hereditary mtc ( table 1 ) [ 31 , 32 ] . \n the detailed and up - to - date information of ret sequence variations can be obtained from the men2 ret database ( www.arup.utah.edu/database/men2/men2_welcome.php ) , which also contains links to selected men2 literature reviews , gene and protein information , and ret reference sequences . \n the men2a subtype , accounting for 9095% of the men type 2 cases , is a highly penetrant , autosomal dominant endocrine tumor syndrome characterized by the development of mtc in > 90% of ret mutation carriers . in association with mtc \n in addition , rare variants of men2a are also associated with cutaneous lichen amyloidosis and hirschsprung disease [ 35 , 36 ] . \n patients with men2a usually have mutations in the extracellular cysteine - rich region of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor , usually in exon 10 ( codons 609 , 611 , 618 or 620 ) or exon 11 ( codon 634 ) ( table 1 , figure 1 ) [ 31 , 37 ] . \n more than 80% of men2a patients exhibit a specific substitution , i.e. , cys634arg , on exon 11 . \n mtc is generally the first manifestation of men2a syndrome and develops during early childhood , usually before age six and sometimes before age two . the men2b subtype accounts for approximately 510% of the men type 2 cases . \n men2b patients typically feature early coincident onsets of mtc , pheochromocytoma , and gastrointestinal mucosal ganglioneuromas . \n visible physical symptoms include mucosal neuromas of lips ( bumpy lips ) and tongue , and asthenic marfanoid body habitus [ 36 , 40 ] . \n men2b patients usually have mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain 2 ( tk2 ) in the intracellular region of ret , which almost always ( > 95% ) lead to a single substitution , i.e. , met918thr , in exon 16 ( figure 1 ) [ 31 , 37 ] . de novo mutations , which usually occur on the paternal allele , are also common in men2b . \n men2b is characterized by the early development of an aggressive form of mtc in all affected individuals , typically during the first year of life . \n thus , apart from the genetic testing of ret mutations in children born to a parent with men2b , early diagnosis of men2b remains challenging . \n individuals with men2b are likely to develop metastatic mtc at an early age if they do not undergo prophylactic thyroidectomy before age one . without this intervention , \n fmtc is considered as the least aggressive clinical variant of men2a with decreased penetrance and/or delayed onset of the other endocrine pathologic manifestations [ 39 , 43 ] . similarly to sporadic cases , familial mtcs are isolated and are not associated with other endocrine tumors . \n patients with fmtc harbor mutations similar to men2a in either the extracellular or intracellular region of the ret tyrosine kinase receptor [ 6 , 44 ] . \n the onset of fmtc is relatively late , not appearing until the second or the third decade of life , and its penetrance is lower than the mtc caused by men2a and men2b [ 31 , 39 , 45 , 46 ] . \n therefore , it is often difficult to determine fmtc based upon a family history and only careful genetic screening can distinguish between inherited and sporadic forms of mtc . \n mtc cells secrete the polypeptide hormone , calcitonin , and the glycoprotein carcinoembryonic antigen ( cea ) ...",

    "input": "neurosurgery is characterized by the delicate balance between surgical success and potential for devastating side effects . thanks to multiple technological improvements \n , the morbidity of neurosurgical interventions has substantially decreased over the last decades , allowing for the resection of previously inoperable lesions . in particular , image - guided neurosurgery ( igns ) devices allow the use of coregistered and fused multimodality 3d images to guide the surgeon 's hand and help define preoperatively the boundaries of pathological and predefined functional structures . meanwhile \n , new modes of medical imaging have also improved the localization of pathological lesions and their characterization . \n medical imaging nowadays includes a wealth of different techniques , such as computed tomography ( ct ) , structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ( smri and fmri ) , diffusion tensor imaging ( dti ) , and positron emission tomography ( pet ) . \n although the overall accuracy of igns is estimated to be 12  mm , current neuronavigation systems can not , however , adapt to changing conditions over time . \n skull - opening brain shift , brain retraction , cerebrospinal fluid suction , lesion resection , perfusion , and pharmacological manipulation during surgery indeed all alter the 3d morphology of the structures [ 25 ] . \n these changes can lead to localization errors that are one order of magnitude larger that igns accuracy [ 1 , 2 , 6 ] and may result in incomplete resections or unexpected damage to normal brain . \n such inaccuracies could be reduced if one could acquire , throughout surgery , fresh images of the same modalities and quality as the preoperative ones \n intraoperative images such as intraoperative mr ( imr ) images are  with the exception of a handful surgical facilities  usually acquired using low - field mri scanners that provide lower resolution and contrast than their preoperative counterparts , and , to this date , several useful imaging modalities , such as pet and possibly meg , can not be acquired intraoperatively . \n one solution is to  bring over  the high - quality preoperative multimodality images into the intraoperative configuration of the brain using a nonrigid registration technique [ 710 ] . \n one category of nonrigid registration techniques uses physics - based models , where landmarks are tracked in successive reduced - quality intraoperative images , and their displacement fields drive the deformation of a biomechanical model . \n so far , most of the mechanical conditions of the brain can not be estimated in the operating room , such as the volume of cerebrospinal fluid flowing out of the skull cavity , intercellular fluid volume changes that result from mannitol injection , or changes in blood volume and vessel permeability . \n the fact that an intraoperative image can provide the knowledge of the current state of the brain after some deformation partly eliminates the need for a complete evaluation of these mechanical conditions . \n the nonrigid registration technique replaces them with the landmark displacements evaluated from successive intraoperative images . using a nonrigid registration technique based on a biomechanical model , three types of brain deformations \n have been identified that require specific modeling , although they depend on common parameters , such as csf suction , perfusion , or pharmacological manipulation . \n the first deformation is the brain shift , which appears at the beginning of surgery with the opening of the skull and dura . \n the suction or leakage of csf , as well as the release of intracranial pressure caused by tumor growth , generally cause such shift of the brain ( note that in this work , we name  brain shift  the specific shift of the brain that occurs after the opening of the skull and dura , before any other surgical act has happened ) . \n however , for these deformations , we will consider that the shift is a part of these two deformations . \n the second deformation is the retraction ; when target tissues are located deep inside the brain , the surgeon incises brain tissues and inserts a retractor to spread out the tissues , and to create a path towards the target . \n the third deformation is the resection , that is , the removal , of lesion tissues . \n three deformations can thus be defined in terms of the two elemental actions that change the topology of the brain : the introduction of a discontinuity and the removal of some tissues . \n most studies of brain deformation based on biomechanical models have focused on shifts ( the topology of the brain is not modified ) , that occurs just after the opening of the skull and dura [ 1125 ] . \n a good review of these different studies can be found in [ 24 , 2628 ] . \n resection and retraction are more complex to model than ( brain ) shift . until recently , \n their modeling for the specific application of preoperative image update has received much less attention . \n one of the difficulty for modeling resection and retraction is that both induce a topological change of the brain because some tissue are cut . \n a method of mesh adaptation [ 2931 ] or remeshing [ 3235 ] must be used in conjunction with fem if an accurate representation of the location of the cut , for example , the resection cavity or retraction path , is needed to deform the model . indeed , fem can not directly handle discontinuities that go through the fes , and requires to realign the discontinuity with fe boundaries . in the field of fracture mechanics , which studies the growth and propagation of cracks in mechanical parts \n , some methods were developed to avoid using fem in conjunction with mesh adaptation or remeshing . \n the extended finite element method ( xfem or x - fem ) appeared in 1999   and has been the object of considerable research since then . \n xfem works by allowing the displacement field to be discontinuous within some fes of the mesh . \n the mesh does not have to conform to the discontinuities , so that these can be arbitrarily located with respect to the underlying fe mesh . because xfem allows an accurate representation of the discontinuities \n while avoiding mesh adaption or remeshing , and because of the similarity between cracks in mechanical parts and cuts in tissue , we proposed the use of xfem for handling cut , resection , and retraction in the updating of preoperative images . \n this paper presents a complete 3d framework for updating multimodal preoperative images with respect to surgical brain deformations , due to brain shift and successive resections , followed and quantified using imr images . \n our approach is modular , and is applied iteratively each time a new intraoperative image is acquired . \n we take into account successive deformations based on a linear elastic biomechanical model which is deformed using fem or xfem , depending on the type of deformation occurring between the pair of imr images under consideration , namely , brain shift or resection . \n while some 3d results have already been presented for brain shift , and initial 3d results for resection   modelings , this paper is the first complete and detailed account of the generalization to 3d of our 2d previous work . \n we present the state - of - the - art of resection modeling for preoperative image update . in section 3 \n , we describe our basic strategy for updating preoperative images based on successive intraoperative images . in section 4 , we give detail about our methods and algorithms . in section 5 , \n we consider two patient cases that illustrate our approach for handling brain shift followed by successive resections . \n among studies that take into account resection for preoperative image update , one should distinguish two categories . \n the first category of studies models brain deformation using two time - point images , the first image being acquired before surgery has started , the second image being acquired after resection . in this category , \n the methods that existed for a second image showing some brain shift are adapted for a second image showing some resection . \n the second category of studies models brain deformation using more than two time - point images , and models at least two successive resections . among the first category of studies , \n hagemann et al .   developed a 2d method for modeling brain deformation between a preoperative mr image and a postoperative mr image , the postoperative image showing a complete resection . \n the 2d mesh of the biomechanical model corresponded to the underlying pixel grid of the 2d image . \n the biomechanical model included four different linear elastic laws for the skull / skin region , the whole - brain region , the csf region , and the image background . \n they computed the correspondence of the skull boundary , the whole - brain region boundary in the neighborhood of the tumor , and the posterior midline between the two images . \n they also com...",

    "input": "the contribution to human health of the specific fatty acid ( fa ) composition of the diet has received considerable attention in the literature . \n fatty acids are key nutrients that affect early growth and development as well as the prevention of chronic disease in later life.1 among the fas , omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-3 pufa ) and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-6 pufa ) have been suggested to decrease and increase several human diseases , respectively . \n pufa that contains more than one carbon double bond consists of two major classes such as n-6 and n-3 ( fig . \n linoleic acid ( la ) is a representative n-6 pufa , serving as a substrate to be converted into an arachidonic acid ( aa ) affecting the prevalence and severity of inflammation . \n n-6 pufa can induce cardiovascular disease , diabetes , cancer , and age - related disease.1 \n -linolenic acid ( ala ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa 20:5 ) and docosahexaenoic acid ( dha 22:6 ) are important n-3 pufa involved in human . \n they are essential fatty acids that can not be synthesized by mammals , by which must be obtained from dietary sources such as cold - water fish , certain seeds ( flax ) and nuts ( walnuts ) . \n a lot of studies suggest that n-3 pufa , as diet - dependent factors , may be critical to preventing disease backed up with authentic antioxidative and anti - inflammatory actions . especially , n-3 \n pufa has been shown to exert beneficial effects on some chronic degenerative diseases such as cardiovascular disease,2,3 rheumatoid arthritis,4 diabetes,5 other autoimmune diseases,6,7 and cancer.8,9 increased fat consumption by western diet has been associated with the development of cancer such as breast , colon , pancreatic , and prostate cancers with the notable exception of n-3 pufa , which show to have multiple beneficial anti - tumor actions that affect the essential alterations that dictate malignant growth in a number of studies.10 a diet rich in n-3 pufa may protect from cancer , at least at certain sites . \n studies on the fatty acid status of patients with several cancer types including bladder , pancreatic , lung and esophageal cancer show low concentrations of plasma phospholipid n-3 pufa , ranging from 55 to 88% of amounts in healthy individuals.1113 recent studies have found a positive association between n-6 pufa and cancer risk , whereas in the same model , n-3 pufa were shown to reduce the development of cancer . \n epidemiological studies suggest that a high n-3 pufa to n-6 pufa ratio may be the optimal strategy to decrease breast cancer risk.14 solid epidemiological study shows that consumption of n-3 pufa appears to protect against the development of hepatocellular carcinoma , even among patients with hepatitis b virus ( hbv ) and/or hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infection.15 recently , zhennan et al . \n has reviewed prospective studies investigating the possible protective effects of the dietary intake of n-3 pufa on prostate cancer development.16 fasano et al also has reviewed a lot of in vivo and in vitro experimental studies providing strong indications of the anti - tumor action of n-3 pufa against lung cancer.17 the purpose of this review is to discuss the potential role of n-3 pufa in gastrointestinal ( gi ) cancer development . \n we believe that increased consumption of n-3 pufa may lower the risk of gi cancer development via various chemopreventive activities . \n future studies should include combination treatment of n-3 pufa and nutrients with different and complementary mechanisms of chemopreventive action . \n among various cancers , most of the gi cancers including esophageal cancer , stomach cancer , and colon cancer , have a natural history of multi - step transition from precursor lesions to malignant lesions , inflammation , adenoma formation , dysplastic changes.18 therefore , gi cancers usually have premalignant lesions before developing invasive cancers , for instances , barrett s esophagus for esophageal cancer , chronic atrophic gastritis accompanied with intestinal metaplasia for gastric cancer , and adenoma or dysplasia originating from chronic ulcerative colitis for colon cancer . \n because the western diet contains disproportionally high amounts of n-6 pufa and low amounts of n-3 pufa , denoted as a high n-6 to n-3 pufa ratio , n-3 pufa may feasibly play a role in several stages of gi cancers management . \n esophageal cancer is ranked as the sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide . according to the increasing incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease ( gerd ) , \n esophageal cancer is a tumor that has increased in incidence more than 7-fold over the past several decades . \n suggests that negative associations between n-3 pufa intake and the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma.19 higher in - takes of n-3 pufa [ cases vs. population controls ;

95% ci=1.031.21 per g / day ) . \n moreover , it is reported that n-3 pufa supplemented parenteral nutrition can reduce inflammation and improve immune function in patients following esophageal cancer surgery20 and n-3 pufa - containing diet may be beneficial to patients with esophageal cancers who receive chemoradiation therapy ( crt ) by reducing crt toxicity.21 in contrast to other gi cancer , little work has so far been performed on the influence of n-3 pufa in oesophageal adenocarcinogenesis and neoplastic progression.22 there is a need for appropriately powered randomized - controlled studies to assess the long - term benefit of n-3 pufa . gastric cancer ( gc ) is the fourth most common cancer worldwide , and almost two thirds of affected individuals will die of their disease . \n some studies about the association of n-3 pufa and gastric disease suggests a protective effect of n-3 pufa on gastric cancer . \n recently , correa et al . suggests that docosahexanoic acid ( dha ) inhibits helicobacter pylori ( h. pylori ) growth in vitro and mice gastric mucosa colonization.23 \n h. pylori are recognized as a major etiological factor in chronic active gastritis , gastric duodenal ulcers and gastric cancer . \n it has been proposed that pufa hold an inhibitory effect on bacterial growth via disruption of cell membrane leading to bacteria lysis.24 mohamed also shows that n-3 pufa reduced iodoacetamide - induced gastritis in rats through decrease of malondialdehyde ( mda ) , gastrin , and nitric oxide ( no ) and normalization of mucosal glutathione.25 especially , it is reported that the erythrocyte composition of dha was found to be negatively linked to risk of gastric cancer , of well - differentiated adenocarcinoma.26 application of a diet enriched with n-3 pufa delayed tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model.27 \n in vitro studies have shown that n-3 pufa inhibited macrophage - enhanced gastric cancer cell migration and attenuated matrix metalloproteinase ( mmp)-10 expression through erk and stat3 phosphorylation28 and inhibited the growth of human gastric carcinoma cell via apoptosis and combination with 5-fluorouracil has synergetic effect in inhibiting the proliferation of gastric cancer cells.29 moreover , n-3 pufa are beneficial for preventing oxidative stress - induced apoptosis by inhibiting apoptotic gene expression and dna fragmentation of gastric epithelial cells.30 on the other hand , dha induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells by inducing the expression of apoptotic genes in gastric cancer cells.31 although a large body of literature spanning numerous cohorts from many countries and with different demographic characteristics does not provide evidence to suggest a significant association between n-3 pufa and stomach cancer incidence,32 further studies are needed to investigate action of n-3 pufa relevant to antitumor effects in the stomach . \n colorectal cancer ( crc ) is the second leading cause of cancer - related death in men after lung cancer and third in women behind lung and breast cancers in the united states . among the gi tract cancer \n , crc cancer has raised the most attention over the past decades , as they share a long precancerous stage ( the adenoma in crc ) which provides a window of opportunity to intervene and prevent development of cancer . recently \n there is also evidence suggesting improved efficacy and/or tolerability of conventional colon cancer chemotherapy when administered with n-3 pufa.9 epidemiological studies about the association of dietary fat and cancer suggests a protective effect of n-3 pufa and a promoting effect of n-6 pufa on cancer . \n although epidemiological studies of the association between fish intake , n-3 pufa intake or blood n-3 pufa levels and crc risk have not consistently suggested beneficial effects of n-3 pufa on crc and other gi cancer risk . \n dietary administration of one or both of the...",

thus , angioedema occurs . just as with hereditary angioedema ( hereditary c1inh deficiency ; hae ) , common clinical manifestations are skin swelling , laryngeal edema , and/or abdominal pain.1,2 aae often occurs in the context of lymphoplasmacytic disorders , such as monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance ( mgus ) , non - hodgkin s lymphoma , or chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( cll).1,3 among 32 patients with aae , castelli found that 13 ( 40% ) had mgus and 9 ( 28% ) had lymphoproliferative disease.3 therefore , all cases of aae should be evaluated for the possibility of underlying lymphoplasmacytic disorder . \n conversely , when patients with known lymphoproliferative disease manifest compatible symptoms , aae should be expeditiously considered . \n this is important because aae can be effectively treated medically , but delayed diagnosis can lead to unnecessary diagnostic procedures , therapeutic interventions , or life - threatening complications , well - illustrated by our case . \n a 78-year - old woman with atherosclerotic vascular disease was transferred to our hospital with abdominal pain and underwent emergent laparotomy . \n one year earlier , she had been diagnosed with rai stage i cll which had been observed without treatment . \n two months earlier , she presented with severe abdominal pain , nausea , and vomiting . over the next 8  weeks , she had six emergency room and/or hospital admissions for identical symptoms . \n pains would begin at rest in the lower abdomen , spread to the upper abdomen , described as  gas - like  , non - radiating , constant . \n extensive evaluation included colonoscopy , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography , magnetic resonance angiography , and abdominal aortography . \n benign colon polyps and small gallstones were removed , mesenteric stenoses ruled out , yet pains recurred unabated . \n there was no dysphagia , change in bowel habits , gi bleeding , fever , or sweats . \n physical examination on transfer revealed blood pressure 130/88  mmhg , pulse 88 beats per minute , respiratory rate 20  cycles per minute , pulse oximetry of 95% on ambient air , and temperature 97.0f . \n hemoglobin was 18.1  g / dl , hematocrit 55% , platelets 146    10/l , and leukocytes elevated to 34,500 cells/l with 47% neutrophils and 48% lymphocytes . \n ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with iv contrast showed multiple abnormal loops of small bowel with contrast - enhanced bowel wall edema ( fig . \n . 1a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast shows several abnormal loops of small bowel with a target appearance indicating bowel wall edema . \n b a section of small bowel shows massive submucosal edema . there is no infiltration of the wall by lymphocytes a ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast shows several abnormal loops of small bowel with a target appearance indicating bowel wall edema . \n b a section of small bowel shows massive submucosal edema . there is no infiltration of the wall by lymphocytes at laparotomy , massively swollen small bowel was encountered and resected . \n c4 was 3  mg / dl ( normal 1746 ) , c3 66  mg / dl ( 85200 ) , and c1inh activity reportedly 83% ( 68200% ) . \n serum protein electrophoresis revealed two faint bands immunofixing as monoclonal igm kappa and igg kappa . \n lymphocytosis and lymphadenopathy improved and c1inh activity increased to 110% . over 3  years of follow - up , abdominal symptoms never recurred . \n approximately 145 cases have been reported of aae,3 and this is one of four cases that we have diagnosed in the last decade with abdominal pains from aae with associated cll . \n table  1 shows characteristics of patients with cll and aae we have seen ( some briefly mentioned in a prior report).4 this is our only case to undergo surgery , allowing unique and dramatic demonstration of massive bowel edema visible radiographically , on surgical inspection and on histopathology . \n an initial c1inh activity was reported low normal , but there can be no doubt about the diagnosis based on radiologic / surgical / histologic findings , further laboratory results , and the clinical course . \n characteristic are very low c4 level and low c3 ;

however , subacromial / acromioclavicular joint encroachment with these implants is associated with subacromial pathology , and this may negatively influence the final outcomes . to overcome the shortcomings of the joint - spanning implants , acromioclavicular joint - sparing implants ( 2.4 mm lcp distal radius plates , synthes , usa ) have been suggested . \n additionally , a combination of this implant with some form of coracoclavicular fixation using sutures / anchors / endobutton devices ( tightrope , arthrex , fl , usa ) has been recently described for use in the highly unstable fracture subgroup . \n however , comparative clinico - radiological outcomes of the two techniques are lacking in literature . \n the purpose of this study was ( 1 ) to analyze the overall and comparative clinico - radiological outcomes ( radiographic and ultrasonographic ) of surgical treatment of distal clavicle fractures associated with complete coracoclavicular ligament disruption , and ( 2 ) to identify and analyze radiographic patterns of fracture and comminution that are associated with this injury . \n the hospital records of all patients who were surgically treated for lateral clavicle fractures between 2005 and 2008 at three hospitals were retrospectively evaluated to identify the study group . \n inclusion criteria for this study was defined as : ( i ) acute , isolated , non - comminuted and comminuted fractures of the lateral clavicle , ( ii ) complete disruption of both coracoclavicular ligaments , confirmed on radiographs and at surgery , ( iii ) absence of concomitant or pre - existing subacromial pathology ( rotator cuff tears , acromial undersurface degeneration ) , ( iv ) surgical treatment with either a joint - spanning implant alone ( group 1 ) , or combination of a joint - sparing implant and coracoclavicular fixation with either endobutton device , suture anchor , or coracoid cerclage ( group 2 ) [ figures 1a and b ] , and ( v ) follow - up period of at least 6 months for radiographic evidence of union . \n exclusion criteria was defined as : ( i ) partial disruption of the coracoclavicular ligaments at surgery , ( ii ) subacromial pathology ( iii ) concomitant injuries to the ipsilateral shoulder girdle , ( iv ) surgical treatment with any technique other than those described in the inclusion criteria , and ( v ) follow - up period inadequate for complete union . \n surgical treatment of an unstable distal clavicle fracture with a joint - spanning implant ( group 1 ) . \n ( hk : hook plate , cl : clavicle , m : medial fragment , l : lateral fragment , arrow : fracture line , ac : acromion , h : humeral head , co : coracoid process ) surgical treatment of an unstable distal clavicle fracture with a joint - sparing implant and coracoclavicular ligament reconstruction using endobutton device ( group 2 ) . \n ( rp : locking distal radius plate , arrow : acromioclavicular joint , ac : acromion , cl : clavicle , en : endobutton , h : humeral head ) the clinical records and operative notes were analyzed to identify patients that satisfied the criteria described above , and all other lateral clavicle fracture patients were excluded . \n pre - operative radiographs of the study group were obtained and analyzed with a graphic analysis software ;

these were analyzed for implant migration , acromioclavicular joint pathology ( degeneration , instability ) , subacromial changes ( degeneration , osteolysis ) , acromiohumeral interval measurement ( normal interval = 7 mm or more ) , peri - coracoid changes ( abnormal bone formation ) , and glenohumeral changes . \n in addition , in those cases where implant had been previously removed , past radiographs were obtained from the records and individually analyzed as described above . \n the follow - up ultrasonographic protocol included evaluation of the acromioclavicular joint , subacromial space , glenohumeral joint , bicipital groove and biceps long tendon , and suprascapular and spinoglenoid notches ; ultrasound assessment was performed by a senior radiologist experienced in shoulder ultrasound . \n statistical analysis was performed using a statistical software ( spss inc , chicago , usa ) to determine mean values and range of measured parameters of the overall and implant specific groups . \n significant differences between clinical and radiological parameters were determined using the non - parametric mann - whitney / wilcoxon rank - sum test for numerical data , and the fisher 's exact test for categorical data . \n the average age of the patients in the study group was 34.5 years ( range , 20 to 57 years ) . \n the mechanism of injury was a direct impact to the ipsilateral shoulder sustained during a fall ;

    "input": "brachial plexus surgery using the da vinci surgical robot is a new procedure . to evaluate the advantages and the restrictions of the technique , a cadaveric study of supraclavicular and axillary approaches was conducted . \n we found that the axillary approach was useful and advantageous for lower roots , particularly for thoracic outlet syndrome ( tos ) . \n this report will focus on the evaluation of axillary robotic approach as the advantages and disadvantages of supraclavicular robotic intervention have been widely discussed in the literature . \n a human cadaver was subjected to this experiment in paris university ecole europenne de chirurgie anatomy laboratory and da vinci robot system was used . \n the left arm was tucked along the side and the right arm was placed in a semiflexed position extending toward the anesthesia location near the head , supported by foam and blankets ( figure 1 ) . \n a 6  cm long incision was made at the right axillar line , lateral to the edge of the pectoralis major muscle ( figure 2 ) . \n a self - retaining chung retractor was placed into the incision to elevate the pectoralis major muscle flap . \n the robot was docked as a camera ; right and left robotic arm were adapted in the incision area ( figure 3 ) . a 10  mm 0 downlooking scope , maryland forceps , and a curved scissors \n the working space was maintained with the self - retaining retractor , without co2 insufflation ( figure 4 ) . \n the subclavian artery was seen in front of the truncus and was positioned to the posterior of the working space . \n subclavian artery was dissected from the plexus and truncus of the lower plexus was exposed with blunt dissection . \n the plexus was exposed thoroughly from t1 to c7 levels . in this surgical setting , the operating surgeon , who has \n a wide experience in open brachial surgery of the brachial plexus , reported that lower brachial plexus exposure was easier from the axillary working area and a more wide range of motion was achieved to manipulate the robotic tools compared to the supraclavicular exposure for lower part of the brachial plexus . \n the development of robotic - assisted minimally invasive techniques began in urology , general surgery , and gynecology because of the generally large working spaces available in the abdomen for these types of surgeries [ 14 ] . \n since then , other surgeons have sought to use robotic devices in other areas , such as the brachial plexus [ 5 , 6 ] . \n brachial plexus dysfunction can be the result of shoulder trauma [ 7 , 8 ] . \n it can also occur with tos , which encompasses three separate disorders involving compression of the subclavian artery , subclavian vein , or brachial plexus in the triangular space bordered by the first rib , clavicle , and scalene muscles [ 9 , 10 ] . \n compression of the vessel - nerve package at the thoracic inlet has been treated with soft - tissue ( scalene muscle ) release and/or bone ( first rib ) resection . \n surgical approaches to first rib resection may be transthoracic , transaxillary , supraclavicular , infraclavicular , or thoracoscopic [ 9 , 10 ] . however , these approaches are typically associated with incomplete resection of the most medial portion of the first rib and neurovascular complications . \n theoretically , a minimally invasive transthoracic approach can obviate these problems , enabling complete resection of the offending portion of the first rib without neurovascular complication . \n , respectively , reported successful results of robotic en bloc first rib resection for tos treatment via transthoracic and transaxillary approaches [ 9 , 11 ] . \n 's techniques were only bony interventions and as being intrathoracic these need to be lung collapsed and lung complication can be waiting risk . \n although liverneaux et al . reported techniques and results of upper brachial plexus injury intervention via robotic surgery with a supraclavicular approach , they described the disadvantages as a narrow working space and difficulty to expose the c7 vertebra [ 1 , 5 , 12 ] . to our knowledge , this report is the first to objectively describe robotic axillar brachial plexus exposure . \n thus , we discuss the theoretical and clinical advantages and disadvantages of the axillary approach in the present report . \n the development of robot - assisted surgery has revealed new perspectives in peripheral nerve microsurgery . minimally invasive \n robot - assisted surgery could lead to modification of the classic algorithm for the treatment of traumatic brachial plexus lesions [ 6 , 8 ] . to date , exploration of these lesions has not been attempted less than 3 months after the traumatic event because clinical examination can not provide an accurate diagnosis or reliable prognosis in these first weeks . \n early intervention may enable initial assessment of the lesion and repair of potentially graftable nerve roots . \n several robotics properties are particularly adapted to microsurgery , such as high - resolution three - dimensional ( 3d ) visualization with up to 40 magnification , up to 10-fold magnification of surgical movements , elimination of physiological tremors , and the provision of ergonomic work conditions for otherwise uncomfortable surgery . \n robotic surgical systems allow high -

    "input": "older people have particular spiritual needs that are distinct from those of others , particularly in times of ill health and death and dying . \n it has been reported that spirituality has a positive effect on health outcomes and welfare of the elderly . \n nowadays , aging phenomenon and relevant problems with its complexities are important issues that have attracted the attention of social and medical scientists to investigate the spiritual needs of the elderly . \n spiritual health is a dimension of health that is portrayed as the validation of life in relation to god , fellow human beings , and the environment . \n spirituality is the representative of the basic values that guide a person in searching to find answers to the crucial questions of life , such as the purpose and meaning of life , reality , love , good and bad , disease , and death .   over the past three decades , spirituality , religion , and prayer \n have turned into a subject of large interest for researchers in medicine , nursing , gerontology , physical health and mental health disciplines , often in conjunction with complementary and alternative medicine . \n this tendency has been stimulated by research demonstrating physical and psychological benefits of spiritual and religious involvements . \n in fact , approximately 96% of adults in the united states expressed their belief in god , and 72% of identified religion and spirituality as having the most important influence in their lives . saying prayers is a regular daily task for muslims which begins at the age of puberty and continues throughout the life . \n it is a time getting rid of the material world and approaching the world beyond , as well as , to the inner self . in iran , elderly people are more religious than younger ones , and this is a norm of this culture . \n a recent national survey of the iranians values and attitudes found that over 80% of the iranians practice prayer regularly as a part of their religion . \n one might argue that this is a true reflection of individual culture where prayer and religious beliefs are a part of people 's everyday life . \n however , prayer can go beyond just performing a religious duty , and based on one 's wishes , take different forms of formal and informal practices . \n it has been shown that disease prevalence , incidence and mortality rates differ from one population to another . \n this is partly ascribed to their disparities in lifestyle , dietary habits and other characteristics that are somehow affected by culture , especially religious traditions and experiences .   during the past two decades \n some studies have been carried out and the associations between religious beliefs or experiences and various types of physical illnesses , mental health , and mortality have been examined . \n spirituality is viewed as personally important matter to the older people and it has been proved that it is highly related to older people 's health outcomes . \n however , there has not been adequate experiential research on the relationship between religious or spiritual factors and healthy lifestyle behaviors , and their impact on the adult 's well - being . \n scientists believe that probing the effects of religious and spiritual factors as well as healthy lifestyle behaviors may be decisive . \n additionally , social science and medical research have concurrently reported that older adults are more inclined to take spiritual chase than younger people are . \n kotrotsiou - barboutal et al.(2006 ) indicated that older adults are remaining members of religious associations without necessarily participating regularly in services , as there are numerous issues that can diminish the active participation in religious events , such as transportation intricacies , bad sound , or the illegibility of small font text in books of prayers available at mosques or religious centers . in spite of those complexities , \n many elderly manage to find out a way to come up to god through prayer . \n it is stated that prayer increases the feelings of personal value of an elderly by reducing the feelings of loneliness and desertation , while television and radio provide support for spiritual life .   in this regard , researchers have shown that some groups of elderly people with inadequate and difficult livelihood situations communicate their problems by putting their trust in god . moreover , more than half of the elder patients practiced spiritual needs throughout their hospitalization period , with the most prominent need of being in the search of the meaning of life . \n extensive epidemiological studies have shown that higher levels of religiousness are related to lower mortality rates . \n studies identified the multidimensional nature of religiousness and spirituality and investigated various religious dimensions , for instance private religious behaviors , devotion , spiritual transcendence , and religious adaptation . \n for example , it was indicated that some aspects of religiousness predicted lower rates of disability and illness , alcoholism , cardiovascular disease , hypertension , and myocardial infarction . \n furthermore , clinical research has suggested that spirituality can play a vital role in the recovery of patients suffering from physical and psychological diseases . \n it seems that religious obligation has a crucial role in averting physical and mental diseases , recovery promotion , and disease adaptation . \n numerous studies have revealed the positive involvement of spirituality and religious indexes on different aspects of health such as cardiac surgery , mortality , immunity system function and self esteem . \n above all , religious involvement can be useful for psychological well - being and physical health . \n additionally , supporting the effect of spirituality may become more and more prominent in later life as a result of declining health , social and financial sources . \n researchers have proposed numerous psychological , social , and physiological interveners that may explain the spirituality - health association . \n quantitative measurements and the evaluation of spiritual beliefs are difficult because quantitative studies neither reveal the content , components of the beliefs , and its factors , nor the contexts that might be included . therefore , implementing qualitative research that explores the personal and experiential aspects of beliefs seems crucial , and may shed light on a range of important issues which can be investigated in detail on larger samples by further quantitative studies in future . \n spiritual or religious beliefs may affect the decisions of individuals that make about their health and illness . \n thus , recognizing and understanding the spiritual and religious behaviors within the context of cultural influence by a qualitative research is critical for nurse and other health - care providers . \n the main strengths of the present study are that it focuses on the spiritual life of healthy elderly people . \n therefore , the present study aimed to explore the concept of spirituality from the perspectives of iranian healthy elderly people . the central question of the paper was  what characterizes the spirituality in the iranian healthy older people ? \n in this research , a qualitative approach was adopted using conventional content analysis of unstructured interviews carried out with 17 healthy elderly people in tehran in 2010 - 2011 . \n it is worth noting that spirituality is underpinned by personal and cultural context in any community ; therefore , qualitative research is the best method to study cultural context - bound subjects . \n initially purposeful sampling was used and continued with purposeful sampling according to the codes and categories emerged from data . \n the study consisted of 17 healthy elders within the age range of 65 - 86 . \n criteria for selection were having age above 65 , living with family , not having any cognitive problems , not having any physical limitation in adl , and willingness to participate in the study . \n all participants were shia muslims . in order to achieve the wide range of experiences and perceptions of elderly participants , some field notes writing and 21 interviews were conducted according to emerged codes and categories from data . the first researcher communicated with each of the participants to describe the purpose of research and research questions . \n based on the participants preference , the interviews were performed in a private room at the house of elderly , park , worksite , or mosque , using an individual semi - structured interview format and this was primarily the main method for data collection . \n interview query consisted of open - ended questions to allow respondents thoroughly to describe their opinions , perceptions , and experiences . \n the participants were asked to describe one day of their life and then to explain their own experiences and perceptions about  spirituality in elderl...",

30.04.2010 ) because of intensified symptoms of left - sided renal colic . based on the conducted usg and single - phase computed tomography tests of the abdominal cavity and the pelvis , dilation of the ureter \n was found because of its infiltration by a pathological focus with the dimensions of 28 mm  15 mm . \n another lesion was located nearby at the level of the left iliac muscle  30 mm  27 mm  20 mm , adhering to the sigmoid colon . \n tissue infiltration of the pelvis minor wall was found descending in the direction of the left appendages . \n colonoscopy was conducted and in this test the large intestine was described without pathology , while the gynaecological usg test confirmed the presence of fluid in the pelvis . during her stay the patient was treated with analgesic and diastolic medication and then referred for further treatment at the regional oncology centre . because of reported pain complaints , she was immediately admitted to the department of oncological surgery on the day of her visit to the outpatient clinic ( 04.05.2010 ) . \n the urologist consulting the patient indicated the possibility of kidney damage due to ureteral obstruction with recommendation for an accelerated operation . \n therefore , pre - operative diagnostics were not extended beyond the tests received from the district hospital . \n the patient underwent surgery on 10.05.2010 and intraoperatively , besides the expected neoplastic tumour of the left ovary with infiltration of the ureter , numerous neoplastic foci were also found : a sigmoid colon tumour , a caecum tumour , a tumour of the body of the stomach and two single tumours in the omentum . \n because of the resectability of the neoplastic foci described above , the operation plan adopted earlier was changed and the following were performed in succession with palliative intention : partial gastrectomy by the rydygier method , right - sided hemicolectomy , left ovariectomy and sigmoid resection . after restoring the continuity of the alimentary tract , \n the tumour occluded the lumen , which is why segmental ureterectomy was performed with end - to - end anastomosis over a pigtail catheter . \n the patient passed the post - operative period without complications , except a two - day fever . \n because of the expected alimentary tract failure , parenteral nutrition was included on the 1st day after the procedure and blood deficits were supplemented with 2 units of erythrocyte mass and 7 units of plasma . \n on the 9th day after the operation , the patient was discharged home in a good general condition with recommendations for further treatment . \n the received postoperative histopathological protocol indicated that the stomach was the origin of the neoplastic process . \n to lauren ) , type i ( acc . to goseki ) , of a stomach adenocarcinoma with a g2 malignancy degree , with occupation of the whole thickness of the stomach wall , with the following immunohistochemical characteristics : ck7(+++ ) , ck20(++ ) , ca125(+ ) , mucicarmine(+ ) . \n neoplastic infiltrations along nerves and neoplastic embolisms of blood vessels , as well as metastatic foci in the greater omentum , were observed in the specimen . because of the palliative partial gastrectomy type , only 3 lymph nodes were described in this specimen and all of them contained neoplastic cells . besides the above \n , histopathological confirmations were obtained of the metastatic character of the foci in the ovary , caecum and sigmoid colon . \n the cancer occupied large and small intestine walls without infiltration of the mucous membrane and the immunohistochemical characteristics were identical as for the primary lesion . according to the above protocol , excision within tissues with a healthy margin of these organs was achieved . \n the widening of the left ureter is visible ( marked by arrow ) focus of metastatic carcinoma in the ureter wall \n . microscopic section , he staining , magnification 40 neoplastic invasion in the ureter wall . \n microscopic section , he staining , magnification 100 it is interesting biologically and constitutes the basis for this paper that the ureteral tumour was described by the pathologists not as a neoplastic infiltration encroaching on the ureter , but as a metastatic focus to the ureteral wall . \n after the operative treatment , the patient was qualified for palliative chemotherapy and received it from 28.07.2010 . \n the first treatment course was according to the eox regimen ( oxaliplatin and capecitabine ) , but because of the occurrence of neutropenic fever the regimen was changed to pf ( cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil ) . \n she again received only one course and the treatment was changed once more because newly formed metastatic foci in the liver were located in imaging tests . \n next , three chemotherapy courses were administered according to the folfiri regimen ( irinotecan , leucovorin and 5-fluorouracil ) , but only until 11.11.2010 because due to progression of changes in the liver described in examinations the chemotherapy was discontinued and the patient was qualified for symptomatic treatment . according to our knowledge \n treatment of gastric cancer in the disseminated phase of the disease aims at extension of life and achieving a good palliative effect . \n the recommended methods , allowing the above to be achieved , are chemotherapy or combination radiochemotherapy . in an advanced stage , \n palliative operations on this organ are performed for life reasons and serve to eliminate complications such as bleeding , perforation or obstruction of the organ . \n it is indicated that the above complications forced surgical intervention in 1/4 of the patients previously disqualified from operative treatment because of the presence of metastatic foci . according to literature data , patients operated on by palliative resection in the disseminated phase of the disease achieve a survival time of between 9 and 15 months . the survival time is limited by the number of metastatic foci ; when their number is higher than two foci , no statistically significant differences are observed in this scope \n . the value of these procedures is increasing because of the reported low perioperative mortality and the observed significant improvement in the further quality of life for these patients [ 513 ] . \n it seems that the operative procedure conducted in the presented patient allowed a good palliative effect to be achieved along with loss of severe colic and maintenance of kidney function . \n the literature often presents , as characteristic of gastric cancer , blood - borne metastasis to the ovary , termed a krukenberg tumour . \n this is a term generally defining metastasis to the ovary , mainly gastric cancer and next colon cancer . \n metastases from other organs , such as the lungs , the mammary gland and the uterus , are also possible , though much rarer . \n krukenberg tumours are encountered in the course of 2 - 4% of disseminated neoplastic processes . \n this is a negative prognostic factor , with varying median survival time after its diagnosis : 12 - 13 months in the course of gastric cancer compared to 17 -

this dose was maintained for 7 days ) . \n therefore , she underwent a repeated short - term follow - up egd that showed regenerative epithelial tissue with peeling off , of the necrotic tissue ( fig . \n she underwent a repeated egd that showed the replacement of white color scar tissue ( fig . \n currently , she is being treated with 30 mg / day prednisone and is showing considerable clinical improvement . \n eosinophilic gastroenteritis is an uncommon and rarely reported disorder characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the various tissue layers of the digestive tract in the absence of any definite causes of eosinophilia , without eosinophilic infiltration in other organs . \n the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastroenteritis is based on the following criteria : the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms , histological presentation of eosinophilic infiltration in tissue layers of the digestive tract , presence of high eosinophil count in ascites , and no evidence of parasitic infection or eosinophilic involvement of extraintestinal organs . \n eosinophilic gastroenteritis can involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract from the esophagus to the rectum , and the stomach is the most commonly involved organ , especially the antrum . in eosinophilic gastritis , \n the endoscopic features are rather extensive : rugal fold thickening , erythema , friability , nodularity , gastric outlet obstruction , gastric ulcer , and even a normal mucosa . \n although not clearly defined , the common pathophysiological mechanism of this disease is associated with eosinophilic infiltration and degranulation in specific tissue layers of the digestive tract . \n this eosinophilic recruitment and activation regulated by diverse cytokines is a part of the host immune mechanism in the gastrointestinal mucosa ; however , it can be a type of serious allergic or inflammatory reaction in the deeper tissue layers of the gastrointestinal tract . although there is no treatment consensus on eosinophilic gastroenteritis , \n several studies report good results with steroids in dosages from 20 to 40 mg / day , for 6 to 8 weeks [ 7 - 10 ] . in some case studies , \n leukotriene modifiers such as montelukast or mast cell stabilizers such as sodium cromoglycate have been proposed to be helpful for symptomatic improvement . \n antihistamines such as ketotifen or immunosuppressants such as mycophenolate mofetil are also used in the treatment of eosinophilic gastroenteritis ; however , their therapeutic effects are not clear and would require more studies . \n although rare , eosinophilic gastritis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients with gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral blood eosinophilia . \n lymphoma of the stomach , gastric cancer , and crohn disease involving the stomach may demonstrate endoscopic features similar to those of eosinophilic gastritis . \n gastrointestinal parasitic infection should be considered in patients with abdominal discomfort , weight loss , and peripheral eosinophilia . in particular , infestations by hookworms , \n ascaris , strongyloides , toxocara , trichuris , and intestinal capillaria should be considered in patients from endemic areas . in this case , the concentration of the antigen - specific ige to the a. simplex was 0.57 \n moreover , the serology for toxocara antibodies ( igg ) was positive . however , this is not clinically significant in korea because koreans often consume raw fish , which causes repeated exposures to anisakis . \n in addition , she had not had contact with any animals , including dogs and cats , at least for several years . \n moreover , she was treated with albendazole for 5 days , and her symptoms had become worse . after steroid treatment , the symptoms disappeared and the eosinophil count decreased to the reference range . \n moreover , the follow - up egd showed regenerative epithelial tissue with peeling off , of the necrotic tissue \n . she had undergone several egds that showed diffuse necrotic change in the fundus , cardia , and upper body . \n the etiology includes thromboembolism and occlusion of major arterial supply , ingestion of corrosive agents , volvulus of the stomach , endoscopic hemostatic injections , and infectious gastritis . in this case \n thus , the possible cause of gangrene could be infection , and she was treated with empirical intravenous antibiotics ( cefoperazone and metronidazole ) . \n however , she was treated with broad - spectrum antibiotics during the next 5 days , and her symptoms became worse . \n the necrotic portion of the gastric high body is very vulnerable site of retching injury . \n this retching injury is called prolapse gastropathy syndrome , a clinical syndrome involving the invagination of part of the gastric mucosa into the lower esophagus . \n direct trauma to the mucosa occurs when the gastric mucosa becomes incarcerated through the lower esophageal sphincter . \n in addition , the endoscopic findings and histopathologic results were not compatible to prolapse gastropathy syndrome . on the basis of the clinical picture , laboratory findings , and therapeutic results , we concluded the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis in our patient . \n this case highlights the reality of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis , and that endoscopy and histopathological examination of the biopsies are the most useful tools for the diagnosis of eosinophilic gastritis presenting as necrotizing gastritis . \n eosinophilic gastritis should be considered i...",

\n in skin , caspase-14 is expressed only in the differentiating and cornifying layers of the epidermis and the hair follicle ( lippens et al . , 2000 ; \n this is consistent with the observation that , in vitro , caspase-14 is only expressed in differentiating but not in proliferating keratinocytes ( lippens et al . \n remarkably , nail matrix keratinocytes that differentiate into specialized nail corneocytes , the building blocks of the nail plate , do not express caspase-14 ( jager et al . \n in addition , caspase-14 is not expressed in the noncornifying keratinocytes of the sweat gland or the mouth epithelium ( lippens et al . , 2000 ; \n ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that spatial distribution of caspase-14 in the epidermis and hair follicles is strongly conserved among several mammalian species ( alibardi et al . \n caspase-14 was found to be associated with the nucleus , the keratohyalin granules , and the desmosomes , whereas in corneocytes , caspase-14 was found in the cytoplasm and was associated with corneodesmosomes ( a modified version of desmosomes ) and nuclear remnants . \n these observations suggested a role for caspase-14 in nuclear degradation during cornification , but nuclear degradation was not affected in caspase-14deficient mice ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) . \n the expression of caspase-14 in the hassall 's bodies of the thymus and in the forestomach of rodents is somewhat expected , as they are cornifying structures and express the typical late differentiation markers , such as profilaggrin and loricrin , which are also found in the epidermis ( laster and haynes , 1986 ; favre , 1989 ; jarnik et al . , 1996 ) . \n protein expression of caspase-14 has also been reported in several noncornifying tissues ( lippens et al . , 2003 ; krajewska et al . , 2004 , 2005 ; kam et al . , 2005 \n however , these observations should be interpreted carefully , as we have recently shown that the reported expression of caspase-14 in such tissues can be the result of aspecific staining ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) . \n remarkably , so far caspase-14 has been found only in terrestrial mammals but not in birds or reptiles . \n whereas birds and reptiles have a stiff , dry , scaly epidermis , mammals have a soft stratum corneum because of the larger amounts of histidine - rich late differentiation markers ( e.g. , profilaggrin ; alibardi , 2003 ) . \n interestingly , profilaggrin is a direct substrate of caspase-14 ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) . \n this could indicate that the occurrence of a soft stratum corneum and the caspase-14 gene are associated during evolution . \n although the expression of caspase-14 is very restricted , little is known about the transcriptional regulation of its gene . in vitro \n , caspase-14 is only expressed when keratinocytes are forced to differentiate by growing them postconfluently or in suspension or by adding vitamin d3 ( eckhart et al . \n in contrast , adding ca at high concentrations to the medium , a method frequently used to induce differentiation , did not induce caspase-14 expression ( eckhart et al . \n retinoids , which suppress keratinocyte differentiation , down - regulate caspase-14 expression ( rendl et al . , \n these results indicate that transcription factors that are specifically active during terminal differentiation are required to regulate caspase-14 expression . whether caspase-14 expression levels can be regulated at the posttranscriptional level is not known . \n down - regulation of several differentiation - associated genes by retinoids has been shown to be mediated by the transrepression of activator protein 1 ( ap-1)mediated gene activation ( fisher and voorhees , 1996 ) . \n indeed , the caspase-14 promoter contains at least two potential ap-1binding sites ( unpublished data ) . \n the green tea phenol ( )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( egcg ) is a potent activator of ap-1 and has been shown to up - regulate caspase-14 in a p38- and jnk - dependent way ( hsu et al . , 2005 , 2007 ) . \n ap-1 alone is probably not sufficient to drive caspase-14 expression because tnf and 12-o - tetradecanoyl - phorbol 13-acetate , two potent activators of ap-1 in keratinocytes ( arnott et al . , 2002 ) \n , did not induce caspase-14 expression in keratinocytes ( lippens et al . , 2004 ) . \n differentiation - dependent expression of caspase-14 in keratinocytes could also result from a strong transcriptional repression in proliferating keratinocytes . \n this possibility is supported by the observation that mice deficient in nuclear receptor corepressor hairless ( hr ) had 510-fold higher levels of caspase-14 and profilaggrin mrna , starting from postnatal day 6 and progressing during development ( zarach et al . , 2004 ) . \n these alterations in gene expression were detected mainly in the keratinocytes of the utricle , an abnormal pouch - like structure at the upper part of the hair follicle . increased \n gene expression occurred before the morphologically distinct utricle could be identified , indicating that the up - regulation was probably a cause rather than a consequence of utricle formation \n . it would be interesting to analyze both caspase-14 activation and filaggrin processing in these mice . \n multiple mutant hr alleles in mice and in humans show phenotypic variations that include congenital hair loss , skin wrinkling , and papular rash ( cichon et al . , 1998 ; \n 1998 ) . whether caspase-14 overexpression is important for the observed phenotypes could be addressed by generating epidermis - specific caspase-14 transgenic mice or by crossing the hr mice with caspase-14deficient mice . \n procaspases consist of a prodomain , a large subunit ( p20 ) , and a small subunit ( p10 ) . \n activation of caspases is induced by dimerization , ( auto-)proteolytic cleavage at asp residues , and/or conformational changes ( lamk...",

    "input": "kelch - like ech - associated protein 1 ( keap1)-nuclear factor e2-related factor 2 ( nrf2 ) is a major cellular pathway that protect normal cells against oxidative and xenobiotic damage.1 nrf2 is an essential transcription factor for antioxidant and detoxification genes and is crucial for the chemopreventive effect of various phytochemicals against carcinogenesis . \n representative chemopreventive agents that induce nrf2 include carotenoids , curcumins , cyclic lactones , diterpenes , dithiolethiones , epithionitriles , flavonoids , indoles , isothiocyanates , organosulfides , and phenols.2,3 accumulating evidences have demonstrated that phytochemicals can protect cells from oxidative stress related diseases including inflammatory , cardiovascular , and neurodegenerative diseases and cancer , through nrf2-dependent responses . \n paradoxically , recent researches demonstrated the dark side of nrf2.4 cancer cells acquire a growth advantage by eliminating keap1-mediated negative control of nrf2 , which leads to activation of the nrf2-dependent defense response.4 constitutive upregulation of nrf2 has been found in many types of cancers , including skin , breast , prostate , lung , head and neck , and endometrial cancer.5 overexpressed nrf2 provides a growth advantage for cancer cells by protecting those cells from oxidative stress and anticancer agents , thus contributing to chemoresistance.5 in this review , we summarize the therapeutic development of nrf2 inhibitors that enhance the efficacy of the current cancer treatments . \n nrf2 is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor with 7 domains from neh1 to neh7 . \n neh1 has dna binding motifs.6 neh3 , neh4 , and neh5 have domains involved in the transactivation of nrf2 target genes by binding coactivators . \n neh2 has a major regulatory domain with 2 binding sites for keap1 named etge and dlg ( fig . \n keap1 has 5 functional domains including kelch , intervening region ( ivr ) , broad complex / tramtrack , bric - a - brac domain ( btb ) , an n - terminal region ( ntr ) , and a c - terminal region ( ctr).3 cysteine residues of ivr play as a sensor for reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . \n the btb domain has a cys151 residue and is responsible for nrf2 ubiquitination through binding to cullin e3 ubiquitin ligase ( cul3)-based ubiquitin e3 ligase ( fig . \n 1a ) . under unstressed conditions , nrf2 forms a complex with keap1 , leading to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26s proteasome ( fig \n . 2a).7 upon exposure to a variety of stressors , including ros , toxicants , and carcinogens , nrf2 is released due to modification of the cysteine residues of keap1 ( fig . \n 2b).8 two mechanistic models have been proposed for the regulation of nrf2 : the hinge and latch model and the keap - cul3 dissociation model.810 in the hinge and latch model , 2 binding motifs of the neh2 domain in nrf2 have different affinities.9 for the ubiquitination , both the dlg and etgf motifs should be occupied by keap1 proteins . \n ros modify the cysteine residues of keap1 , leading to the release of the dlg motif ( latch ) without changing the etgf motif ( hinge ) on neh2 . \n another model is the keap - cul3 dissociation model in which oxidative stress disrupts the keap1-cul3 e3 ligase interaction without changing the conformation of keap1.8 nrf2 stabilization with de novo synthesis increases the cytoplasmic level of nrf2 . \n nrf2 translocates into the nucleus and binds to an antioxidant response element ( are ) as a heterodimer with musculo - aponeurotic fibrosarcoma ( maf ) to recruit a transcriptional coactivator and promote thetranscription of various cytoprotective genes that are associated with antioxidant and detoxification enzymes . upon recovery of cellular redox homeostasis , keap1 translocates to the nucleus to dissociate nrf2 from the are resulting in degradation of nrf2.11 \n nrf2 binds to ares in promoter regions of various genes that regulate the cellular response to oxidative and xenobiotic stress . \n nrf2 target genes include antioxidant genes and phase ii enzymes such as heme oxygenase-1 ( ho-1 ) , nad(p)h : quinone oxidoreductase 1 ( nqo1 ) , glutathione s - transferase ( gst ) , and glutathione peroxidases . \n the are - bearing genes that are regulated by nrf2 in humans have been studied using microarray analysis of genes induced by chemopreventive agents or knockout of keap1 in human cell lines.2 these genes can be categorized into 5 groups : antioxidant genes ( gclc , gclm , gpx2 , gsr , slc7a11 , srxn1 , and txnd1 ) , nadph - generating enzymes ( g6pd , me1 , and pgd ) , metal - binding proteins ( fth1 , ftl , mt1 , and mt2 ) , drug - metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters ( akr1b1 , akr1b10 , akr1c1 , akr1c2 , akr1c3 , akr1c4 , cbr1 , gstm3 , mrp2 , nq1 , and ptgr1 ) , and stress response proteins ( gadd45 , hmox1 , hsp40 , and hsp70).2 knockdown of keap1 in human keratinocytes resulted in upregulation of 23 mrnas while akr1b1 , akr1b10 , and akr1c1 were induced to the greatest extent , showing increases of between 12- and 16-fold indicating that aldo - keto reductases could be useful biomarkers for nrf2 activation.12 as keap1 is responsible for inhibitor kappa b ( ib ) kinase beta ( ikk- ) ubiquitination , upregulation of some of these genes could be attributable to the increase of nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf-b ) activity.13 expression profiling in mice has revealed that nrf2 regulates approximately 100 genes and that two - thirds of nrf2-target genes are not involved in detoxication or antioxidation . instead , many of the target genes are associated with inflammation and immunity proteins.2 \n the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( ahr ) is a transcription factors that mediates the biological effects of its xenobiotic ligands including dioxin.14 the ahr activates the transcription of nqo1 and other genes through the xenobiotic - responsive element ( xre).15 ahr induces the direct binding of nrf2 to promoters or indirectly produces reactive intermediates that trigger the nrf2 signaling pathway.16 the cross - talk between nf-b and nrf2 is more complex . \n several chemopreventive agents , such as sulforaphane , epigallocatechin-3-gallate , and curcumin , induce nrf2 signaling with concomitant repression of nf-b.14 the nf-b p65 subunit re -

well as firefighting , are associated , in addition to common mechanical hazards ( e.g. , due to splashes of molten metals and slag ) , sparks and direct contact with open fires , with hazards caused by emission of harmful optic radiation within the visible ( vis ) and infrared ( ir ) spectrum range . \n excessive exposure to ir radiation leads to dryness of the mucous membranes , burns of the eyeball and development of cataracts . \n protection against thermal hazards due to excessive amounts of ir radiation reaching the eyes is provided by protective optic filters installed in spectacles , goggles or face protections . besides protecting the user against hazardous ir radiation \n , such filters should ensure that the object / area of work can be seen clearly . if the level of ir radiation is very high , \n the use of filters reflecting radiation is recommended , as it allows the temperature increase in the filter itself to be reduced . \n the filters currently used for the protection of the face and eyes against hazardous ir radiation are of metallic reflective type , made of glass or organic material ( mainly polycarbonate ) bases coated with a single metallic layer for reflectance of ir radiation or absorption filters . \n absorption filters are manufactured from dyed glass obtained in a mass staining process by introduction of a factor modifying the radiation within the vis and near infrared ( nir ) spectrum range passing through the filter . \n the effect of a protective optical filter obtained as a result of this process is based on absorption of a large proportion of optic radiation , whereas only a small proportion of radiation the filter is exposed to is reflected . \n this is an undesirable phenomenon , contributing to deterioration of the filter user 's comfort . \n reflective metallic filters are obtained by deposition of a metallic layer of copper ( cu ) or gold ( au ) on mineral or organic bases . \n such filters take advantage of the characteristic properties of the metals used in their production , i.e. , significant reflection coefficient for ir radiation and significant transmittance for the vis spectrum . despite the fact that the technique of deposition of interference layers has been known for many years   the application of thin film ir filters in eye protections to block \n the previous papers published by the authors of this study   contain descriptions of the structure of interference filters designed for application in eye protections \n highly effective in reduction of ir radiation with high level of transmission of the vis spectrum . \n the authors investigated also the optical and mechanical parameters of the newly developed protective optic filters manufactured with the use of interference technologies . \n the analysis of the results of the conducted tests demonstrated numerous advantages of interference technology application in the construction of protective filters , including : improved resistance to damage of the external protective filter surface ( cracking , scratching etc . ) as well as high reflection coefficients for the nir spectrum . \n the aim of the present study was to compare the optic properties of protective filters manufactured by taking advantage of the interference technology and those coated with a single metallic layer reflecting ir radiation . \n the coefficients characterizing their optic parameters , allowing to assess the protective properties within the vis and ir spectrum range were compared . \n the following coefficients were analysed : \n luminous transmittance (  \n v),ir transmittance within the 7801400  nm range (  \n a),ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range (  \n n),ir reflectance within the 7802000  nm range ( r \n n),ir absorptance within the 7802000  nm range ( a \n n),shade number ( n ) . \n luminous transmittance (  \n v ) , ir transmittance within the 7801400  nm range (  \n a ) , ir transmittance within the 7802000  nm range (  \n n ) , ir reflectance within the 7802000  nm range ( r \n n ) , ir absorptance within the 7802000  nm range ( a \n n ) , the level of protection ( shade number ) is determined on the basis of luminous transmittance ( the higher protection level correlates with the higher level of ir radiation blocked and appropriately lower vis light transmittance ) . \n protection level consists of a code number ( e.g. , 4 ) for ir filters and a shade number ( e.g. , 3 , 5 , 7 ) calculated according to the following equation : \n ( 1 ) \n where  \n v \n =  luminous transmittance . for the particular level of protection , the mean ir transmittance within the 7801400 and 7802000  nm ranges as well as the ir reflectance and absorptance within the 7802000  nm range are determined . \n for comparative analysis of the metallic reflective filters available in the market versus the interference filters developed by the authors , the following samples were prepared for the tests : \n off the shelf metallic reflective filters on a polycarbonate base ( flat parallel plate of 50  mm diameter and 2  mm thickness with a metallic layer of copper ( cu )  protection levels : 4 - 3 , 4 - 5

optical properties of the filters were measured with a cary 5000 spectrophotometer ( varian , australia ) . the spectrophotometer enabled transmittance or reflectance of optical radiation within the vis and nir spectrum to be recorded with 1  nm steps and 0.001% resolution level . \n spectral transmittance and reflectance measurements were carried out within the wavelength range of 7802000  nm . \n the quartz halogen lamp was used as a source of radiation . to detect transmitted or reflected radiation \n the photomultiplier tube and lead sulphide detector were used for vis and nir spectrum , respectively . \n spectral transmittance was measured with incident radiation falling normally on the filter surface in the visual centre ( defined as in ) . for spectral reflectance \n the measurements were taken every second owing to the high absorption of investigated filters within the nir region . \n since the minimum averaging time of the cary 5000 spectrophotometer was 0.0125  s , the values of transmittance or reflectance were measured 125 times for a given wavelength . \n the aforementioned coefficients were calculated from the following equations [ 1012 ] : \n luminous

    "input": "endotracheal intubation is one of the most important skills for anesthesiologists in securing the airway during general anesthesia and resuscitation . \n failure to secure the airway can cause anesthesia - related life - threatening morbidity and mortality . \n however , the difficult laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation rate still remains at 1.513% due to poor reliability of traditional protocols , algorithms , and combinations of screening tools in identifying a potentially difficult airway . \n due to the portable , noninvasive characteristics , point - of - care ultrasound ( us ) technique has been widely used in the operating room for ultrasound - guided nerve block , central venous access , and pneumothorax diagnosis . with improved visualization of airway structures , \n prasad et al . first found that us can reliably image all of the structures visualized by ct , and the infrahyoid airway structure parameters measured by ultrasound agree well with the parameters measured by ct . \n adhikari et al . further demonstrated that the anterior neck soft tissue thickness measured by ultrasound at hyoid bone and thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an index to predict difficult laryngoscopy , but only the anterior neck soft tissue thickness at thyrohyoid membrane levels can be used as an independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy . \n interestingly , they did not find a correlation between us measurements and clinical screening tests . \n .   also found that an abundance of fat tissue at the anterior neck region as detected by ultrasound in israeli obesity patients was a very good independent predictor of difficult laryngoscopy , being a much better predictor than body mass index ( bmi ) per se . \n however , a similar study in the unites states showed that us quantification of anterior soft tissue and general bedside screening tests failed to predict difficult laryngoscopy in american obese patients , suggesting that racial or body shape differences might exist . to define the role of airway us in predicting difficult laryngoscopy \n , we evaluated the feasibility of ultrasound in predicting difficult laryngoscopy in a chinese han population . \n after approval of the research protocol by the local hospital ethics committee for human studies and obtaining personal informed consent , 203 american society of anesthesiologists ( asa ) grade i and ii adult patients undergoing elective surgeries and receiving general anesthesia were included in this study . \n exclusion criteria included patients who had facial , cervical , pharyngeal and epiglottis surgical or trauma history , patients with most teeth lost , and patients with arthritis . \n the modified mallampati score ( mms ) was specified according to the visibility of pharyngeal structures with the patient in an upright sitting position , head in neutral position , mouth wide open , and tongue protruding to its maximum without phonation ( figure 1a ) . \n class i is visualization of the hard palate , soft palate , fauces , uvula , and pillars . \n class ii is visualization of the hard palate , soft palate , fauces , and base of uvula . \n thyromental distance ( tmd ) was measured from the mental prominence to the thyroid cartilage with the patient s neck extended fully . \n interincisor gap ( iig ) was measured from the upper central incisors to the lower central incisors while the patient s mouth was fully opened . \n ultrasound measurements were performed by the primary investigator with the patient supine and the head and neck in neutral position . \n the thicknesses of anterior neck soft tissue at hyoid bone , thyrohyoid membrane , and anterior commissure levels were obtained transversely across the anterior surface of the neck with a 136 mhz hfl38 linear array ultrasound probe attached to a sonosite s - nerve machine ( sonosite inc . , \n the minimal distance from the hyoid bone to skin surface ( dshb ) was measured ( figure 2a , 2b ) . at thyrohyoid membrane level , \n the distance from skin to epiglottis midway ( dsem ) between the hyoid bone and thyroid cartilage was measured ( figure 2c , 2d ) . at anterior commissure level , \n the minimal distance from skin to anterior commissure ( dsac ) was obtained ( figure 2e , 2f ) . \n after anesthesia induction with midazolam 0.04 mg / kg , propofol 22.5 mg / kg , fentanyl 24 g / kg , and succinylcholine 2 mg / kg , endotracheal intubation was carried out by anesthesia providers with a minimum of 2 years of endotracheal intubation experience . \n the macintosh blades were used to expose the target larynx , and no external laryngeal pressure was used to facilitate this process . \n classification of laryngoscopic views was based on the method described by cormack and lehane ( figure 1b ) . \n continuous data are expressed as means ( standard deviation [ sd ] ) ;

diamminedichloroplatinum ii ) and carboplatin ( cis - diammine 1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylatoplatinum ii ) . \n other chemotherapy drugs include nitrogen mustard , amino - nicotinamide , dichloromethotrexate , bleomycin , and 5-fluorouracil [ 5 , 6 ] . \n the first of these drugs , that is , cisplatin , consists of a divalent pt ( ii ) central atom and four ligands of cis - positioned pairs of chlorine atoms or amine groups . \n since its discovery in the 1970s , cisplatin continues to be hailed as one of the most potent cancer chemotherapeutics in children and adults , as it is unique and unmatched in its effectiveness against many cancers , namely , osteogenic sarcoma , medulloblastoma , testicular , cervical , and ovarian cancers . \n similarly , its toxicity profile is expansive , involving the gastrointestinal , hematologic , renal , and auditory systems . \n while the use of saline hydration and mannitol diuresis may prevent nephrotoxicity , neurotoxicity is still not curable or preventable . \n ototoxicity refers to the hearing disorder that results from the temporary or permanent inner ear dysfunction after treatment with an ototoxic drug . \n other drug classes known to have ototoxic properties include aminoglycosides , loop diuretics , quinine , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , and antiretroviral therapy ( art ) . \n this is of concern in south africa , as it is estimated that 12.2% of the population ( 6.4 million persons ) were hiv positive in 2012 , which is 1.2 million more people living with hiv than in 2008 ( 10.6% , or 5.2 million ) . \n resultantly , art exposure had almost doubled from 16.6% in 2008 to 31.2% in 2012 . \n not only will many infected people be at risk for ototoxicity due to arts , but a large number will also be susceptible to hiv - related cancers , such as kaposi 's sarcoma , non - hodgkin 's lymphoma , and cervical cancer , as well as infectious diseases such as tuberculosis , conditions that often require pharmacological therapy with the adverse side effect of ototoxicity . \n it is possible that their treatments could consist of simultaneous use of more than one ototoxic drug , increasing the likelihood of ototoxicity . \n all health care professionals managing patients with cancer should therefore be knowledgeable about the ototoxic properties of cisplatin . \n however , malhotra   indicated that most oncologists in india do not make referrals for audiological evaluations of patients receiving cisplatin , while a study in south africa revealed that the effects of ototoxicity , the role of audiologists , and need for their expertise were not fully realized by the oncologists sampled . \n this is further supported by evidence from the south african study of khoza - shangase and jina   which indicated that most general practitioners sampled also do not appear to carry out ototoxicity monitoring strategies , despite being aware of their own role within an ototoxicity monitoring programme . \n this review therefore aims to serve as resource for health professionals to enhance their understanding of ototoxicity as well as their roles within an ototoxicity monitoring programme by providing an overview and description of this condition in patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving cisplatin chemotherapy . \n the review identified peer - reviewed articles available from january 1975 to july 2015 on the topic of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity and ototoxicity monitoring and included english articles only . \n the same researcher conducted the literature search and reviewed the abstracts and articles for inclusion in the study . \n studies were identified using keyword and mesh term searches of electronic databases depicted in table 1 . a manual search of relevant authors and journals \n the references cited by each publication , review , or book chapter were reviewed in order to locate additional potential publications . in order to be selected , the article had to present data on either cisplatin ototoxicity and/or ototoxicity monitoring in human participants , and no research designs were excluded . running these searches yielded a total of 2106 records , of which 1581 were excluded based on the title and/or abstract as well as duplication . \n eighty - five relevant articles , comprising six national and 79 international articles , were selected . \n a perusal of narrative reviews of other auditory pathologies was conducted in an attempt to determine areas of significance for an overview of cisplatin ototoxicity . \n this resulted in the following eight areas being included : the mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity , clinical presentation , risk factors , incidence rates in adults and children , the effect on quality of life , ototoxicity monitoring , otoprotective strategies , and management of an ototoxic hearing loss . \n one such mechanism , the antioxidant model , involves the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) within the cochlea and consequent reduction in antioxidant enzymes following exposure to cisplatin chemotherapy [ 1620 ] . \n another mechanism of cisplatin ototoxicity involves the significant contribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 3 isoform ( nox3 ) to the generation of reactive oxygen species within the cochlea , when activated by cisplatin [ 17 , 21 ] , while a third mechanism relates to the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel ( trpv1 ) [ 2224 ] . \n the molecular mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity therefore include the following:creation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation ands - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  .with the cellular mechanisms of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity including damage to the outer hair cells , supporting cells , marginal cells of the stria vascularis , spiral ligament , and the spiral ganglion cells , it is evident that the structures of the inner ear are most susceptible to damage by cisplatin chemotherapy , with apoptotic degeneration of the hair cell in the organ of corti being most prominent . \n the outer hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea are most affected [ 27 , 28 ] . \n this leads to an initial elevation of high frequency audiometric thresholds , followed by a progressive loss into the lower frequencies with continued therapy [ 27 , 28 ] . \n knowledge of the different mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity is important for health care professionals as it will create an awareness of its complexity and the resulting clinical presentation . \n creation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation and s - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  . \n cisplatin - associated ototoxicity usually manifests as irreversible , progressive , bilateral , high frequency sensorineural hearing loss   with tinnitus . \n the latter may occur with or without a hearing loss   and may be permanent or transient , sometimes disappearing a few hours after treatment   or alternatively persisting a week after treatment . while most of the hearing loss is permanent , there is sometimes sporadic and partial recovery . in addition , \n rare cases of unilateral hearing loss have been reported , which are usually explained by tumour location and surgical or therapeutic intervention on the affected side . moreover \n , the hearing loss is not always symmetrical [ 33 , 34 ] , with jenkins et al .   finding that 75% of women on cisplatin chemotherapy displayed an asymmetry of hearing thresholds of at least 10  db between ears posttreatment . \n schmidt et al . , in their investigation of 55 children on cisplatin chemotherapy , found that the high frequency hearing thresholds were slightly elevated in the left ear and that males had a greater degree of hearing loss than the females . \n the degree of hearing loss is often variable and is related to the do...",

terminal amino group . \n methods that target the n - terminus can offer significant advantages \n for bioconjugate preparation , as they can be used for a wide range \n of protein targets produced by virtually any expression system . conceptually \n powerful as they are , however , these methods can be hampered by long \n reaction times , often require large excesses of reagent , and/or involve \n at least two - steps for the attachment of synthetic molecules . \n we have \n therefore sought to develop new techniques that can achieve n - terminal \n modification with similarly high positional selectivity , but with \n significantly improved efficiency . \n herein , we report an oxidative \n coupling pathway that can preferentially \n modify the n - terminus of proteins with fast kinetics . \n peptide substrates \n were first used to screen reaction conditions and identify the site \n of modification . a peptide panel with varying n - terminal residues \n was then evaluated to determine the sequence specificity of the reaction , \n leading to the identification of proline as the optimal n - terminal \n amino acid . \n the reaction was next applied to protein substrates , showing \n similarly high levels of conversion when an n - terminal proline residue \n was present . \n this mild bioconjugation reaction enables the facile , \n rapid modification of proteins to create a well - defined and stable \n linkage in a single position , and thus should be useful for many different \n applications in chemical biology and the construction of biomolecular \n materials . \n we have previously reported \n the chemoselective coupling of aniline \n moieties on proteins to electron - rich aromatic rings , such as o - aminophenols , at slightly acidic ph ( 6.06.5 ) . \n these reactions require the addition of naio4 or k3fe(cn)6 as a terminal oxidant , with the latter \n reagent exhibiting improved compatibility with glycoproteins and substrates \n with free sulfhydryl groups . the use of ferricyanide as the oxidant \n also yields a single reaction product ( 1 ) , whereas periodate \n leads to the formation of a ring contracted species as a competing \n pathway . \n the ferricyanide - based reactions \n are presumed to involve an o - iminoquinone as the \n reactive intermediate , as suggested in scheme 1 , or could involve the corresponding o - quinone after \n imine hydrolysis . taken together , the oxidative coupling strategies \n have demonstrated excellent functional group compatibility and the \n ability to join large unprotected biomolecules at low concentrations , \n as demonstrated for the coupling of peptides , polymers , and nucleic \n acids to specific locations on viral capsids and antibody fc domains . while these coupling reactions \n were found to be highly aniline - selective \n under the conditions used , several studies have reported the reaction \n of o - aminophenols and o - catechols \n with native amino acids , dating back to 1949 . \n in addition , recent work by messersmith has shown the ability of \n proteins to be coupled to o - quinone moieties present \n on polydopamine - coated surfaces . \n these reports \n suggested that secondary coupling pathways could be developed to achieve \n the modification of native amino acids with o - aminophenols \n ( scheme 1 ) , and thus initial experiments were \n designed to identify the optimal reaction conditions for achieving \n this with complex molecules . in our previous \n work \n , we noted that low amounts of background reactivity could be \n observed in aniline - based oxidative coupling reactions when higher \n ph conditions ( > ph 6.5 ) were used . in \n an initial effort to characterize this alternative reaction pathway , \n conditions and reaction times \n were first screened to increase the \n reaction yields for peptides that did not contain aniline groups . \n angiotensin i and melittin were used as substrates , as they contain \n many reactive amino acids , including lys , arg , his , trp , and tyr . \n the peptides were exposed to 2-amino - p - cresol using \n k3fe(cn)6 as the oxidant . \n the reaction ph was \n varied from 5.5 to 8.5 , and the reaction mixtures were analyzed using \n maldi - tof ms ( supporting information figure \n s1 ) . \n the level of modification increased with the basicity of the \n reaction , with near quantitative modification of angiotensin i after \n 20 min at ph 7.5 and higher . throughout these initial investigations , \n it was noted that angiotensin and melittin showed significant differences \n in reactivity , with angiotensin consistently demonstrating better \n conversion . \n ms / ms analysis of the angiotensin product was used to \n identify the participating residue , and revealed that the n - terminal \n amino group was responsible for the observed reactivity ( supporting information figure s2 ) . as further \n confirmation of the site - selectivity , \n several peptide substrates were \n screened for reactivity ( figure 1a and supporting information figure s3 ) . \n consistent \n with the n - terminal reaction selectivity , the only peptide that did \n not react had a pyroglutamate in this position , and therefore no free \n amino group . \n ( a ) \n modification of commercially available peptides was monitored by maldi - tof \n ms . \n ( b ) a positional scan of the n - terminal amino acid was \n evaluated . \n peptides with the sequence xadswag were tested for reactivity with 2-amino - p - cresol . \n the reactions were run with 100 m peptide , 200 m \n aminophenol , and 5 mm ferricyanide at ph 7.5 and analyzed by lc  ms . \n shown is the average percent modification with error bars representing \n the standard deviation of three reactions . \n the same peptides were \n used for a screen of coupling partner equivalents ( c ) and a time screen \n ( d ) . \n most buffers did not alter the reactivity , but \n imidazole and buffers containing a morpholine or piperazine ring ( pipes , \n hepes , hepps , and mops ) significantly impeded the reaction ( supporting information figure s4 ) . \n this is possibly \n due to small amounts of buffer impurities that react competitively \n with the oxidized intermediate . \n the time course of the reaction was \n also investigated ( supporting information figure s5 ) . \n in addition , it was found that the peptides could be modified \n using naio4 as the oxidant , or 4-methylcatechol as the \n coupling partner ( supporting information figures s67 ) . both of these reactions showed the same dependence \n on ph ; however , moderate levels of modification were still observed \n at acidic ph ( 5.56.5 ) when using these alternative coupling \n conditions . \n these observations suggested that the peptides were reacting \n with the o - quinone intermediate formed in \n situ from either the catechol or the iminoquinone precursor \n ( after imine hydrolysis ) . \n given the differential \n reactivity observed on peptide substrates , we synthesized peptides \n with varied n - terminal residues ( xadswag ) to determine the specificity of the reaction . \n the bas...",

the montelimar sugar farm is located 62 km from managua . \n however , the ineter humidity data are quite different from the relative humidity registered on the farm located in western managua . \n temperature data were not available at ineter 's website . although only 22 subjects were followed - up for a short period of time in this study , important results were obtained . \n other authors have shown the relationship between heat stress health effects and the ability to perform different tasks , as well as the increased risk of suffering work - related injuries ( 14 ) . in this study , the workers drank more liquid as temperature values increased to maximum peaks . \n this was part of a rehydration process which was well planned in advance by the company 's decision makers . unlike during past harvesting seasons , when water and rehydration solutions were distributed quite randomly , during this harvesting season cool water and specially formulated drinks were distributed or intended to be distributed to workers , who received 1 l just before they began their working day and then 500 ml every 30 minutes . \n the basis of this principle is that drinking to satisfy thirst is not enough to keep a person well hydrated . \n most of the people become aware of thirst once they have lost 12 l of body water and persons highly motivated to perform hard work may incur losses of 34 l before serious thirst forces them to stop and drink . \n since dehydration reduces the capacity for absorption from the gut , workers must be educated regarding the importance of drinking enough water during work and continuing generous rehydration during off - duty hours ( 14 ) . \n there was a significant increase of production , with up to 8 tons per worker during the follow - up period compared to the normal 5.5 tons per worker prior to the change in rehydration measures . \n this important change in rehydration policies and increase in production output is the result of various efforts of training workers , foremen and managers on heat stress prevention , proper hydration measures and quality of ( working ) life carried out by occupational health and safety professionals ( physicians and engineers ) , human resources departments and top management at sugarcane farms . \n . often workers rejected the new rehydration measures , most of the time because it was difficult for them to understand thoroughly the dehydration and physiological compensatory mechanisms . \n some of the reasons for this can be attributed to their low educational level , and feeling that  nothing bad has ever happened to me before , etc . \n certainly more effort in terms of intervention strategies and scientific investigation needs to be carried out among workers in nicaragua who perform jobs in which they are exposed to high ambient temperatures . \n these include farm workers , construction workers , miners and fishermen , especially those employed in the informal sector , which occupies about half of nicaragua 's economically active population . \n more funds should also be designated by companies decision makers for improving basic working conditions , in order to increase overall productivity ( and workers satisfaction in terms of better wages ) . \n this would also translate into safer and healthier workers , less absenteeism from sick leave , fewer accidents and other incidents . \n the author has not received any funding or benefits from industry to conduct this study .",

one is primary extraventricular cpts and the other is a result of a direct extension of fourth ventricular tumors through the foramen of luschka.15 because the tumor of our case revealed no connection from the fourth ventricle , it is considered to originate from small choroid tufts that normally project from each recess at the foramen luschka into the cpa or from ectopic choroidal islets  unconnected  with the choroid plexus.16 \n  the cpp of our case indicated dense calcification with ventricular enlargement . \n the bulbous tufts extended from the fourth ventricular choroid plexus through the foramen of luschka have been known as the bochdalek flower basket , which could be identified in 75% on ct and 96% on mr imaging.17 calcification of the region was found in 38% on normal imaging anatomy.17 in pathological states , calcification of cpp was reported in 4.1% on plain skull radiographs and 23.8% on ct examinations in patients of all \n 9 the feature of the calcification was commonly described as a stippled or patchy configuration that may include some degrees of hemorrhage.8 \n 9 \n 10 dense calcification was exceptionally reported by sarkar et al.2 the rate of hydrocephalus in association with cpp is 90% and the rate increases up to 100% in malignant cpps.8 the cause of hydrocephalus was considered a combination of cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) overproduction ( four to five times that in healthy persons ) , obstruction of csf pathways by the tumor mass , impaired csf absorption , increased protein content of csf around the tumor , subarachnoid scarring or granulations related to recurrent bleeding from the tumor , elevated intraventricular pulse pressure , and adhesions around the exit foramina of the fourth ventricle caused by highly proteinaceous or hemorrhagic csf.2 \n 10 \n 18 the finding of tumor calcification in the cpa generally required consideration of differential diagnosis with papillary or psammomatous meningioma , melanotic schwannoma , and myxopapillary ependymoma . among these tumors , \n association of ventricular enlargement with the finding of calcification might suggest the possible presence of cpts . \n gross total removal was performed in our case of atypical cpp , although the tumor adhered to adjacent structures . in the 2007 world health organization classification of tumors of the central nervous system \n , cpts are classified into cpp as grade i , atypical cpp as grade ii , and choroid plexus carcinoma ( cpc ) as grade iii . among cpts , \n total removal of cpts is recommended and seems to be feasible since a significant prognostic factor was relevant to the extent of tumor removal , and no definitive evidence of the beneficial effect of radiotherapy has been reported6 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20 . however , it is not always possible because of tumor bleeding and firm adhesion to adjacent structures , especially cranial nerves . \n the rate of complete resection of benign cpp was 80% and the 5-year survival rate indicated is nearly 100% . \n the majority of survivors are neurologically intact.19 because of the good prognosis , the preservation of cranial nerve functions should be primarily considered in surgery for benign cpp . as for the atypical cpp \n , the rate of total removal was decreased to 50 from 63%.11 \n 21 atypical cpp showed a recurrence rate of 29% , which was much higher than the 6% seen in cpp . \n in addition , seeding within the central nervous system , spontaneous pulmonary metastasis , or rapid regrowth of atypical cpp were also reported.7 \n 22 \n 23 total or gross total removal should be advocated , especially in malignant cpts even though the tumor encases the cranial nerves . \n the finding of calcification in the cpa should suggest the possible presence of cpp , especially if ventricular enlargement is present .",

    "input": "multipath signals occur in numerous microwave and rf applications when an unwanted portion of the original transmission propagates along any alternate path and ultimately couples to the receiver distorting the amplitude and phase of the desired signal [ 14 ] . \n if the amplitude of the multipath signal is sufficiently large , its impact can be considerable . in multistatic radar and communication systems , \n these types of interference are most often caused by reflections of either the main beam or side lobes with objects near or actually in the beam path . \n classic examples include main beam propagation close to the earth 's surface with associated reflections off of the ground or water ( figure 1(a ) ) . \n various approaches can be used to filter or compensate for these reflections through time - gating   and signal time synchronization . \n the potential for interference from multipath signals increases substantially in near - field applications ( figure 1(b ) ) , especially in situations where the receiving and transmitting hardware are integrated . \n commercially available multichannel network analyzers ( e.g. , zvt8 by rohde & schwarz ; munich , germany ) utilize robust strategies to minimize these signal coupling problems . \n we are developing multichannel transceiving arrays for medical microwave imaging which exploit near - field concepts to produce electrical property maps ( permittivity and conductivity ) of tissues of interest [ 8 , 9 ] and have addressed the issue by incorporating ( a ) dedicated mixers for each channel , ( b ) additional solid state switches for isolation , ( c ) double- and triple - braided coaxial cables , and ( d ) compartmentalized rf circuitry . \n the implementation has proven effective for our application achieving channel / signal isolation greater than 130  db . \n an alternative data acquisition strategy integrates a commercial , 2-port network analyzer with an electronic switching network to feed an array of antennas [ 1012 ] which is effective but also has limitations because ( i ) dynamic range is constrained by the provisions of the network analyzer , ( ii ) two - way signal loss is incurred through the network , and ( iii ) the switching matrix has relatively poor cross - channel isolation . \n equally important in near - field imaging is the multiple paths a signal can take within the imaging zone . \n figures 2(a ) and 2(b ) show a photograph of our clinical breast imaging tank and a schematic diagram of the antenna configuration , respectively . \n in this situation , the array of 16 monopole antennas surrounds the breast and can be moved to multiple vertical positions . \n the antennas and target are submerged in a solution of glycerin and water which is lossy over the operating frequency range ( 700  mhz3  ghz ) . \n early empirical tests have indicated that reflections off the tank side walls do not impact the desired signals for an array with the antennas mounted on a 15.2  cm diameter circle . \n likewise , analysis of the monopole beam patterns as a function of frequency has shown that artifacts are minimal when the array approaches the liquid interface at the top of the tank . \n with respect to reflections off the bottom surface , the base of the tank was at least 1.8 wavelengths ( at the lowest frequency ) below the active sections of the antennas in our initial clinical installation when the array was located at its lowest position during an exam . \n since minimal multipath signals resulted from reflections off the top liquid surface , symmetry would suggest that the same should be true for the base of the tank ( figure 1(b ) ) . \n however , surface waves can cause multipath signals that can be especially difficult to eliminate in near - field systems \n . their excitation can be complex , but their propagation characteristics along two material interfaces , whether planar or along cylindrically shaped structures , have previously been studied in depth [ 1520 ] . \n surface waves can readily propagate at the interface of two dielectric materials or one conductor juxtaposed directly with a dielectric . \n their propagation and attenuation characteristics are nominally determined by the electrical properties of the two materials . \n in addition , their amplitude decays exponentially away from the interface in the perpendicular direction as a function of the lossiness of the complementary materials . \n it should be noted that these investigations have stemmed partially from our efforts to perform microwave tomographic images on patients in an actual mr scanner for the purpose of exploiting the refined spatial resolution of the mr along with the more specific nature of the tissue dielectric properties . \n the mr bore is quite small and places a significant constraint of space for the microwave system . \n this was where we first encountered multipath signal corruption which subsequently led to this study . in the following sections , we discuss the theoretical underpinnings of these modes for the geometries present in our system . \n we demonstrate cases from our current imaging system , where the measurements indicate corruption of the desired signals from multipath signals associated with the base of the tank . \n we then show experiments that allow us to partially isolate the effects to surface waves propagating along other pathways . \n we realize that there are a number of propagation modes around the antennas , their feedlines and the tank surfaces , of which the surface waves are only one possible contributor , but understanding these contributions is important . \n we present an initial strategy for minimizing the effects of these signals which may be instructive for designing other near - field imaging systems , including simulations confirming the earlier theoretical discussion and validating our feedline design strategy . \n a challenging situation occurs when a portion of the transmitted signal propagates along an unwanted path and recombines with the original signal at the receiver . \n time - gating strategies can sometimes be effective when the nature of the multipath signal is well understood [ 1 , 2 ] . \n the potential influence of a multipath signal when the original transmission is a continuous wave can be written as \n ( 1)resultant  signal = acombcos(t+comb ) , \n where \n ( 2)comb = acombtan1(b1a1),acomb = a12+b12,a1=[adecosde+ampcosmp],b1=[adesinde+ampsinmp ] . \n here , \n ade , amp , de , and mp are the desired and multipath signal amplitudes and phases , respectively ,  is the operating frequency , and t is time . \n for example , if the magnitude of the multipath signal is 25  db below that of the desired signal , the maximum possible amplitude and phase errors in the resultant signal would be 0.48  db and 3.22 , respectively . for a 15  db multipath signal \n , these values increase to 1.42  db and 10.24. clearly , the resultant phase and amplitude errors can become very significant for multipath signals that are on the same order of magnitude as the desired signals . \n it should be noted that there can be many multipath contributions with a range of amplitude and phase contributions . \n this single contributor analysis serves to give a flavor that the unwanted effects can be significant and is generalizable to multiple sources . \n the first surface mode to be considered involves propagation along the interface between the tank base and coupling liquid . following the analysis by stratton , figure 3 shows a plane wave in region 1 impinging on an interface ( x = 0 ) with region 2 . in this case \n , the magnetic field ( hy ) is only oriented in the y - direction ( out of the page ) . \n the complex relative dielectric properties in the two regions are 1 = 1  j1 and 2 = 2  j2 , respectively . \n the classic surface wave solution occurs when the reflection coefficient is zero ( at the brewster angle ) , which is complex - valued in this instance . \n if a is the amplitude of the incident plane wave , then the magnetic component of the incident and transmitted waves can be represented as \n ( 3)hy = ae[jh1xjz ] ,  x>0,hy = ae[jh1xjz ] ,  x<0 , \n where h1 +  = k1 and h2 +  = k2 are needed to satisfy the wave equation , k1 and k2 are the wave numbers for the two regions , and  is the propagation constant . \n the wave impedances for the two regions are given by \n ( 4)z1=h1k1z1=h1k1z011j1,z2=h2k2z2=h2k2z012j2 , \n where z1 and z2 are the free space impedances in the corresponding regions , and z1 and z2 are the associated wave impedances [ 21 , 22 ] . \n this yields \n ( 5)h1=h2 , \n where \n ( 6)=21=2j21j1. \n from these relationships , we can solve for \n ( 7)h1=k01(1)12,h2=k012(1)12,=k01(1)12 . \n in this situation , we are primarily interested in surface waves propagating along the outside of a coaxial cable , and their associated attenuation as a function of distance after the mode has been sufficiently established . for this analysis , we will consider the case of a coaxial line which is...",
    "reference": "microwave imaging techniques are prone to signal corruption from unwanted multipath signals . \n near - field systems are especially vulnerable because signals can scatter and reflect from structural objects within or on the boundary of the imaging zone . \n these issues are further exacerbated when surface waves are generated with the potential of propagating along the transmitting and receiving antenna feed lines and other low - loss paths . in this paper \n , we analyze the contributions of multi - path signals arising from surface wave effects . \n specifically , experiments were conducted with a near - field microwave imaging array positioned at variable heights from the floor of a coupling fluid tank . \n antenna arrays with different feed line lengths in the fluid were also evaluated . \n the results show that surface waves corrupt the received signals over the longest transmission distances across the measurement array . however , the surface wave effects can be eliminated provided the feed line lengths are sufficiently long independently of the distance of the transmitting / receiving antenna tips from the imaging tank floor . \n theoretical predictions confirm the experimental observations ."

    "input": "many studies over the past 15 years have focused on discovering solvents that help promote efficient cc bond formation under benign reaction conditions . \n new solvents in dielsalder(2 ) and barbier reactions have been sought to help streamline the one - pot transformations further , reducing synthetic steps and organic waste . \n polar media often accelerate reactions of this type which has led to the use of water as an acceptable solvent for such organic conversions . \n recent contributions from our laboratory to this field have centered on coupling reactions between propargyl aldehydes and allyl or propargyl halides under barbier conditions to form homoallylic and homopropargylic propargyl alcohols . \n these compounds find wide use as synthetic templates and show a propensity for oxy - cope rearrangements ( scheme 1 ) . \n the use of -chloropropargylphenyl sulfide ( 4 ) , coupled with a propargyl aldehyde should offer an easy route into formation of enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures ( scheme 2 ) . \n previous studies revealed that formation of 2 or 3 under indium - promoted barbier conditions is solvent dependent . \n use of an organic solvent for the coupling reaction results in a mixture of 2 and 3 while the use of water as a solvent yields 2 as the sole product . \n it is possible that water protonates the coupled product to form 2 quickly , quenching the alkoxide intermediate , thereby suppressing the possible oxy - cope pathway shown in scheme 1 . \n it may also be possible that the increased polarity of the solvent itself stabilizes the anion formed upon coupling , thus raising the relative rate of cope rearrangement in this system . with a less polar , aprotic solvent , \n the anion will not be quenched , nor will it be stabilized to the same extent as witnessed in water . \n a combination of these phenomena may be why an oxy - cope rearrangement occurs under less polar conditions , forming product 3 ( scheme 1 ) . \n a coupling reaction between 1 and 4 ( scheme 2 ) was conducted under aqueous conditions to form 2 ( y = sph ) , with good regioselectivity ; however , the rate of this reaction is surprisingly slow . \n although reactions of the type shown in scheme 1 are reported in the literature to be accelerated by polar solvents such as water , coupling reactions between 1 and 4 , as shown in scheme 2 , are quite slow . indeed , \n when water is used as the solvent , reactions often require 1036 h for completion . \n this oil has a density greater than that of water so it is presumed to be an organometallic species formed by interaction of the indium metal with the halide species . \n isolation of the oil followed by workup in an acidic thf / h2o mixture leads to isolation of propargylphenyl sulfide and , to a smaller extent , the aldehyde . \n we surmise that low solubility of this organometallic complex leads to poor reagent mixing , slowing the barbier coupling under aqueous conditions . \n second , indium - promoted coupling reactions conducted in water become more acidic as the reaction proceeds . \n we believe it is possible that the aldehyde is in equilibrium with its corresponding hydrate species , reducing the electrophilicity of the carbon center . \n a combination of these two reasons would lead to a decrease in the rate of reaction between 1 and 4 when conducted in an aqueous solvent . \n the reaction proceeds more quickly ( 812 h ) in dmf , a less polar solvent , due to better solubility of all reagents , however , a mixture of 2 and 3 was isolated . \n it was originally expected that a mixture of water and dmf would lead to faster reaction times while still maintaining regiocontrol of product formation . the use of a water / dmf solvent system , however , resulted in a mixture of products with water constituting up to 50% v / v of the solvent system . \n when water exceeds 50% v / v of the solvent system , only product 2 is isolated , but the rate of reaction slows perceptively once again . to help expedite this reaction sequence , \n we began a search for solvent with polarity similar to , or greater than that of water . \n it was expected that an extremely polar organic solvent would promote the same type of acceleration normally witnessed in barbier couplings carried out under aqueous conditions . \n an organic solvent could also help solubilize the intermediate and reduce possible formation of the hydrate species , thus allowing for a faster coupling reaction to occur . \n if increased polarity stabilizes the anion formed by coupling of 1 and 4 , oxy - cope rearrangement should also be suppressed . with a dielectric constant of 186.9 at 25 c , significantly greater than that of water ( 78.37(7 ) ) , and dmf ( 38.3(7b ) ) , \n n - methylformamide ( nmf ) has found occasional use in previous reactions requiring polar organic solvents ; however , it has historically found more widespread use as an organic reagent . with a pka of approximately 24,(7d ) \n nmf is reactive under a range of organometallic reagent conditions , limiting its use as a solvent . \n indium - promoted coupling reactions , however , have been shown to be accelerated under aqueous conditions,(1 ) and the relative acidity of nmf , being higher than that of water , should not hinder the proposed barbier couplings proposed within this paper . \n we were especially intrigued by the fact that the dielectric constant of nmf increases to 220 as the temperature is lowered from 25 to 0 c . \n we were interested in examining what effect the increase in dielectric constant at lower temperature could have on a barbier - style reaction of the type shown in scheme 2 among others . \n this paper reports on the use of nmf in barbier - style reactions with a focus on rates of reaction , stereochemistry , and its use to form enediyne and epoxydiyne skeletal structures.(9 ) \n although nmf has characteristics similar to those of dmf , it also has characteristics similar to water , such as a polar xh bond.(7 ) thus , having found a very polar solvent with properties similar to both water and organic systems , we hypothesized that the 1,2-coupling product could be formed in high yield under short reaction times . \n a series of reactions was set up to test this hypothesis . as shown in table 1 , use of either water or \n nmf resulted in formation of the 1,2-product ( 2 ) solely with no trace of 3 detected in the product mixture . \n although the yield of product was moderate to high in either solvent , product formation in reactions conducted in nmf proceeded at a much greater rate . \n we believe that there are two possible reasons behind the rate increase of coupling reactions carried out in nmf . \n the ratio of reagent was as follows : 1.0:1.5:1.1 ( aldehyde / halide / indium ) . \n the reaction was run at 0.1 m with respect to indium . in the lewis acid catalyzed reaction , 10 molar % of the lewis acid was used . \n all species completely dissolved in nmf , unlike what was observed for reactions in water . as such , we believe mixing is much more efficient , allowing the reaction to proceed at a faster rate . \n has also been noted in many literature examples to lead to rate enhancement in indium - promoted barbier reactions . \n we believe a mixture of better solubility coupled with greater solvent polarity results in an additive effect toward increasing the rate of reactions conducted in nmf when compared to water . \n h - bonding capabilities of nmf may explain the greater regioselectivity for reactions conducted in nmf when compared to those observed in dmf and thf ; however , the h - bonding capacity of nmf is much lower than that of water.(7d ) increased solvent polarity , thus increasing the stability of the intermediate anion and raising the relative energy of the oxy - cope rearrangement , may seem more likely at this time . in an effort to exclude the solvent as a direct participant in intermediate formation when nmf is used , nmr spectroscopy studies were performed to determine if a possible hemiaminal or imminium species was forming in situ ( figure 1 ) . \n the imminium functionality carries a positive charge and would increase the electrophilicity of the reactive carbon . \n mixing of 1 and nmf under sonication for periods of up to 24 h , however , revealed the presence of only 1 and nmf by nmr spectroscopy . possible formation of hemiaminal or imminium species . the presence or absence of a lewis acid has shown to help control stereoselectivity in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions . \n previous studies in our laboratory have shown that the addition of indium(iii ) chloride as a lewis acid favors formation of the syn - product in indium - promoted cc bond - forming reactions between 4 and aldehyde functional groups . in the absence of the lewis acid , \n the anti - product is favored ( figure 2).(5b ) it was our hope that similar effects would be witnessed in the present system , especially while using nmf as the reaction solvent , and we were pleased to s...",

therefore , patients with lada are not insulin dependent at the initial phase ( at least 6 months ) of disease onset \n . clinical manifestation of lada shares the features of classical t1d and type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) ( 2 ) . t1d , lada , and t2d present a spectrum of diabetes . \n they range from patients with classic childhood t1d characterized by autoimmune - mediated destruction of -cells with the lowest c - peptide levels to age - related exacerbation of glucose tolerance with the highest bmi seen in t2d ( 3 ) . \n furthermore , patients with lada have susceptibility genes for both t1d and t2d ( 4 ) , suggesting that lada lies between t1d and t2d . \n b cells infiltrate the islets of young nod mice , the commonly used mouse model for human t1d , and play a role in the initiation of -cell destruction by the autoimmune response ( 5 ) . \n studies have shown that marginal zone b ( mzb ) cells and follicular b ( fob ) cells can effectively activate cd4 t cells and facilitate their proliferation by serving as important antigen - presenting cells , especially as antigen - specific antigen - presenting cells ( 6,7 ) . \n b - cell  targeted therapy has been shown to delay the fall of c - peptide levels in patients with recent - onset t1d ( 8) . \n clinical trials have identified b cells as a possible therapeutic target for the prevention and reversal of t1d . \n b - cell  targeted therapy also has been successfully used in treating other autoimmune diseases , including rheumatoid arthritis ( 9 ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( 10 ) , and multiple sclerosis ( 11 ) . \n moreover , studies have shown that b cells are important in regulating both innate and adaptive immunity ( 12 ) . a subset of b cells expressing cd19cd5cd1d , which have a regulatory function in infection , inflammation , and autoimmune disease , recently has been identified . \n these regulatory b cells can regulate t - cell responses and inhibit inflammation in an interleukin-10 ( il-10)dependent manner ( 1316 ) . \n the maturation and expansion of b10 cells require il-21 and cd40 signals both in vivo and ex vivo ( 17,18 ) . \n considerable evidence shows that patients with autoimmune diabetes have altered frequencies of circulating immune cells , including t cells ( 19 ) , dendritic cells ( 20 ) , natural killer cells ( 21,22 ) , and neutrophils ( 23 ) . \n although studies have reported no significant change in total b cells in peripheral blood of patients with t1d ( 21,24 ) , little is known about b - cell subpopulations with distinct immune functions that may play a role in the diabetes spectrum of t1d , lada , and t2d . \n we hypothesized that an altered phenotype of b - cell subsets is associated with autoimmune diabetes . \n this study investigated a change of peripheral b - cell subsets in patients with t1d , lada , and t2d compared with healthy control subjects . \n the results show altered frequencies of various b - cell subsets associated with autoimmune diabetes . \n two hundred fifty - eight patients with t1d ( n = 81 , mean diabetes duration 3.1  3.5 years ) , lada ( n = 82 , 6.1  5.9 years ) , or t2d ( n = 95 , 3.0  3.7 years ) and 218 control subjects with normal glucose tolerance ( ngt ) ( table 1 ) were enrolled in the current study from the second xiangya hospital of central south university ( changsha , hunan , china ) . \n diabetes was diagnosed according to world health organization ( who ) criteria ( 25 ) . \n diagnosis of t1d was based on acute - onset ketosis or ketoacidosis with immediate insulin replacement therapy ;

    "input": "according to numerous estimations , 15% to 29% of patients with cataract have 1.5 diopters ( d ) of refractive astigmatism.1,2 cataract surgeons usually prefer to treat cataract and correct refractive ( spherical and astigmatic ) disorders at the time of the surgery . \n corneal incision ( astigmatic keratotomy ) and peripheral corneal relaxing incisions ( pcris ) were performed to treat these disorders.3,4 the main drawbacks of these approaches are that the outcome depends on multiple factors as the patient s age , the depth and length of the incision , complications related to wound healing , epithelial defects , or induction of dry - eye symptoms . \n these parameters affect the visual outcome in a unpredictable way so the corneal incisions are not considered a reliable method for astigmatism correction . \n toric intraocular lens ( iols ) implantation was introduced in the 1990 s as an option for astigmatism correction in cataract patients . \n initially they presented the disadvantage of postoperative rotation that decreased the visual outcome.58 new toric iol designs ( acrysof   toric iol ; alcon , fort worth , tx ) , approved by the us food and drug administration ( fda ) at the end of 2005 , have been found to be more stable and appear to be the preferred iol for correcting preexisting astigmatism in conjunction with cataract surgery.9,10 the acrysof   iols are available in three options : t3 , t4 , and t5 of astigmatic correction 1.5 , 2.25 , 3.00 d , respectively ( at the iol plane ) . \n the aim of this study is to report the clinical results of acrysof   toric iols implantation for preexisting astigmatism correction and compare the postoperative rotation of the iols one and six months postoperatively . \n this prospective study included eyes that had cataract surgery at the papageorgiou general hospital , thessaloniki , greece , between may 2008 and december 2008 . \n the study was conducted according to the tenets of the declaration of helsinki and patients gave informed consent after the nature and intent of the study had been fully explained to them . \n inclusion criteria were : cataract , age 70 years or younger , and preoperative regular corneal astigmatism greater than 1.00 d. exclusion criteria were : glaucoma , corneal disease , previous corneal or intraocular surgery , macular degeneration or retinopathy , and history of ocular inflammation . \n each patient had a complete ophthalmologic examination , including visual acuity ( va ) , slit - lamp examination , intraocular pressure ( iop ) measurement , and dilated fundus examination . \n topography ( magellan mapper ; nidek technologies , padova , italy ) , automated refractometry ( rk600 ; reichert , inc . \n , depew , ny ) , and ultrasonic immersion biometry ( ocuscan rxp ; alcon ) were performed to determine the appropriate iol spherical power . \n cylindrical power and axis placement to achieve emmetropia were calculated using an online toric iol calculator program ( available from http://www.acrysoforiccalculator.com/ ) . \n the 0180 axis was marked with the patient in a sitting position to avoid cyclotorsion using the nuijts / lane preoperative toric reference corneal marker ( ae-2791tbl ; asico , westmont , il ) ( figure 1 ) . \n intraoperatively , the desired implantation axis was marked using an intra - op toric axis marker ii ( ae-2794 ; asico ) ( figure 2 ) . \n a foldable iol was implanted in the capsular bag through a 2.75 mm limbal incision on 110. the toric iol was injected with a monarch - ii injector ( alcon ) and placed around 1015 off axis before the ophthalmic viscosurgical device ( sodium hyaluronate 1% ) was removed . \n after ophthalmic viscosurgical device removal , the iol was rotated to its final position by exactly aligning the toric reference marks with the limbal implantation axis marks . \n all surgeries were performed by the same experienced surgeon ( it ) using topical anesthesia and a standard divide - and - conquer phacoemulsification technique . because of the intraoperative marker design and the pen mark fading during the operation in several cases , it was difficult to assess the proper alignment of the iol after its placement . because of this difficulty , an image was captured from the real - time streaming recording of the surgery and was assessed blindly by a second operator using a commercially available software ( screen protractor ; iconico , ny , usa ) ( unpublished data ) . to overcome this difficulty we consider that the use of the marker set consisting of beveled degree gauge ( ae-1590 ; asico ) and maloney astigmatism axis marker ( ae-2741 ; asico ) is more appropriate for the whole procedure because it allows maximum visibility . \n the on - screen assessment of the axis remains a useful tool for postoperative evaluation of the iol location ( figure 3 ) . \n measurements of visual acuity ( using the snellen opto - type at a six - meter distance ) , iop , and comprehensive slit lamp examination were performed at one - day and one- and six - month postoperative visits . at the one- and six - month follow - up \n , a digital photograph and corneal topography ( only at the one - month visit ) were obtained to estimate the postoperative rotation of the iol using the software tools mentioned above ( figure 1 ) . \n outcomes of interest included uncorrected va , cylindrical astigmatism power before and after iol implantation , and the possible rotation of the iol one and six months after the operation ( when the initial desired place was at 0 ) . \n absolute values of the rotation used for the analysis after detecting rotation was not under investigation . \n completed data forms were analyzed with microsoft excel 2007 ( microsoft corporation , redmond , wa ) and spss software ( version 16.0 ; spss inc . , chicago , il ) . \n twenty - nine eyes of 19 patients ( mean age 63.03  5.42 years ) were enrolled in this study . \n uncorrected va was found to be 5/10 or more in 26 of 29 eyes ( 89.7% ) and 8/10 or more in 19 of 29 patients ( 65.5% ) . \n preoperative and postoperative corneal topography showed significant reduction of refractive astigmatism in all eyes after the surgery . \n mean power of the astigmatism was 2.38  0.91 d ( range 1.55 d ) preoperatively and 0.64  0.61 d ( range 02.5 d ) postoperatively ( figure 4 ) . \n one month postoperation , the mean toric iol axis rotation was 2.2  1.5 ( range 0.67.8 ) . \n six months postoperation , the mean toric iol axis rotation was 2.7  1.5 ( range 0.98.4 ) . \n the later rotation occurred between one and six months , and was found to be more than one degree ( 1.1 ) only in one eye ( 3% ) and in all other cases was less than this value ( figure 5 ) . \n it is known that one degree of deviation causes 3.3% reduction of the iol cylindrical power . \n calculated reduction of the desired correction ( in diopters ) because of the observed rotation ( mean value , one and two standard deviations ) for the three iol models is shown in table 1 . \n no eye had secondary surgery to reposition the iol axis within the six - month postoperative period . \n the results of our study corroborate previous studies,11 which demonstrates that proper selection and preoperative examination of patients followed by uncomplicated iol implantation of one - piece hydrophobic acrylic toric iols results in acceptable stability and visual outcome . \n in particular , the postoperative rotation of toric iols appears to occur in the early postoperative period ( 1 month ) and remains constant later than six months . \n the lens rotates until a fibronectin and collagen adhesion develops between the iol and the posterior capsule , which prevents any further rotary motion.12 the amount of cylindrical correction reduction due to postoperative rotation was not large enough13 to affect the expected end result in final uncorrected distance va . \n acrysof   one - piece hydrophobic acrylic toric iols implantation shows satisfactory stability , acceptable clinical results , and is an exceptional option for correction of refractive astigmatism .",

    "input": "song is a complex , learned motor skill that involves the precise coordination of vocal and respiratory musculature in order to produce highly stereotyped renditions of a memorized song model . \n two pathways contributed to this behavior are identified in the songbird forebrain : the motor pathway that is required throughout life for normal song production , and the anterior forebrain pathway ( afp ) which is necessary for song learning and plasticity [ 13 ] . \n hvc ( used as the proper name ) is the beginning nucleus of both pathways and projects to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium ( ra ) and afp . \n the motor pathway is from hvc to ra , and then ra projects to brainstem nuclei controlling the vocal and respiratory muscles . during song , ra neurons in adult birds generate a highly stereotyped sequence of bursts [ 5 , 6 ] and also receive input from lateral magnocellular nucleus of the anterior nidopallium ( lman ) , the output nucleus of afp . \n notably , recordings from lman neurons projecting to ra revealed highly variable spiking activity across song renditions , suggesting that lman may act as a source of variability . \n these results indicate that synaptic activity in lman - ra synaptic transmission is crucial to song plasticity [ 8 , 9 ] , but the detailed mechanism is unclear . it has been observed that ra received excitatory glutamatergic inputs from hvc and lman . \n the former is mediated by a mixture of n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) and -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic - acid- ( ampa- ) type receptors [ 4 , 10 , 11 ] , and the latter is mediated almost exclusively by nmda - type receptors . \n lman - ra synaptic transmission is necessary for the variability of song in adult zebra finch , suggesting that the activity of nmda receptor on the lman - ra synapses might induce the activity pattern change of ra neurons and change the bursts that control the vocal and respiratory muscles . \n the control of gain , which refers to modulation of a neuron 's responsiveness to input , is critically important for normal sensory , cognitive , and motor functions [ 1215 ] . \n gain control is achieved through a divisive process and is observed as a change in the slope of the input - output relationship . \n such gain changes are frequently observed in the responses of cortical neurons and are thought to play an important role in neural computations . \n modulations of gain have been observed in the enhancement of neural responses by attention [ 12 , 16 ] and can also be induced pharmacologically . in a neuron model , \n nmda receptors caused such membrane potential fluctuations between a hyperpolarized down - state and a depolarized up - state , which may gate the information and gain modulation . \n here , we test the gain change of ra projection neurons after exogenous nmda was applied to selectively activate nmda receptors , using whole - cell current clamp recording in adult male zebra finch slices . \n brain slices were prepared from adult male zebra finches ( taeniopygia guttata ) ( > 90 days old ) obtained from commercial suppliers as previously described [ 19 , 20 ] . \n brains were dissected into ice - cold , oxygenated ( 95% o2 and 5% co2 ) slice solution . \n slice solution consists of ( in mm ) sucrose 248 , kcl 5 , nahco3   28 , glucose 10 , mgso47h2o 1.3 , and nah2po4h2o 1.26 [ 21 , 22 ] . \n coronal brain slices ( 250  m thick ) containing ra were cut with a vibrating microtome ( ma752 , usa ) and collected in artificial cerebrospinal fluid ( acsf ) that had been warmed to 37c and subsequently allowed to cool to room temperature . \n slices were allowed to recover in the holding chamber for at least 1.5  h and were equilibrated to room temperature before recordings were made . \n standard acsf consists of ( in mm ) nacl 125 , nahco3 25 , nah2po4h2o 1.27 , kcl 2.5 , mgso47h2o 1.2 , cacl2   2.0 , and glucose 25 and was adjusted with sucrose to a final osmolarity of 350  mos . for recording , \n a slice was transferred to a submerge - type chamber where it was continuously exposed to acsf , saturated with 95% o2 and 5% co2 at room temperature ( 2226c ) at the rate of 2.0  ml / min . \n ra and the surrounding tissues were distinguishable under bx51wi microscope connected with a dic - ir video camera ( olympus , japan ) . at high magnification ( 40x ) , ra neurons were visualized and the recordings were made from healthy cells . \n recording pipettes were fabricated from borosilicate glass ( sutter instruments , usa ) using a flaming - brown puller ( model p-97 , sutter instruments , usa ) and were filled with the pipette solution containing ( in mm ) : k meso4   120 , nacl 5 , hepes 10 , egta 2 , mg - atp 2 , and na3-gtp 0.3 ( ph 7.3 - 7.4 , and 340  mos ) . \n the recording pipettes , which had resistances ranging from 3 to 5  m , were positioned using an integrated motorized control system ( sutter instruments , usa ) . \n the potential changes after application of nmda were corrected during the input - output stimulation protocols . \n the series resistance ( rs ) , between 15  m and 30  m , was compensated using the bridge balance . \n all agents were applied by changing the bath perfusate from standard acsf to modified acsf in which various drugs were simply added . unless indicated otherwise , \n the clampfit 9.2 ( axon instruments , usa ) , mini 6.0 ( synaptosoft inc . , fort lee , nj , usa ) , and originpro 8.0 ( originlab , nothampton , ma , usa ) were used for analysis . \n events with peak amplitude of 50  mv or higher and a rise time of about 0.5  ms were detected automatically , and the results were analyzed with origin pro 8.0 . \n the steady - state spike rate was estimated by counting the number of spikes in 1 second , and the result was plotted versus the intensity of the injected current ( f - i relationship ) . \n the slope of the f - i relationship ( referred to as gain ) was estimated by linear fitting . \n slope parameters were estimated separately for individual neurons and that figures 4 and 5 contain mean slope values averaged for the whole groups of neurons . \n the amplitude of ahp was quantified as the difference between spike threshold and the lowest point of ahp . throughout \n means were compared using paired two - tailed student 's t - test or one - way anova followed by scheffe 's multiple comparison . \n stable whole - cell recordings were obtained in 160  ra projection neurons from 51 adult male zebra finches . \n a neuron with the resting membrane potential < 50  mv and an overshooting action potential was considered viable . \n ra projection neuron was identified by a larger soma , time - dependent inward rectifier induced by hyperpolarizing current and spontaneous regular spike firing or by depolarizing current pulses . \n the input - output relationship was examined by injecting current pulses from 0 to 90  pa with an increment of 10  pa and an interval of 15  s , and they were lasted for 1  s. traces of action potentials in response to 1  s current steps of 10 , 50 , and 90  pa were shown in figure 1(a ) . \n the slopes of the f - i relationships were 246.92  28.00  hz / na before nmda application and increased to 325.49  73.34 \n furthermore , the input resistances were decreased by 20  m nmda in ra projection neurons ( p < 0.05 , n = 6 ) ( figure 2 ) . \n the afterhyperpolarization ( ahp ) of action potential underlies the modulation of firing frequency . to test the effect of nmda on spike ahp \n comparison of spike shape is shown in figure 3(a ) with 90  pa current injection before and after nmda application . in average \n , there was no significant change in the amplitude of ahp after nmda application ( p > 0.05 , n = 5 ) ( figure 3(b ) ) . \n then we used 50  m dl - apv , a nmda receptor antagonist , to check the selectivity of nmda receptor , and we found that the slope of f - i was not changed by dl - apv alone ( p > 0.05 ) . \n the slope was 255.78  66.69  hz / na and 269.34  56.96  hz / na ( p > 0.05 ) before and after application of 50  m dl - apv ( figure 4 ) , respectively . \n nmda increased the f - i slope 1.32 times ( p < 0.05 ) ; however , the gain modulation induced by nmda was completely abolished by dl - apv ( figure 4 ) . \n previous studies reported that ra projection neurons received glutamatergic and gabaergic inputs [ 23 , 24 ] , which might increase background synaptic activities and modulate the gain of neurons [ 25 , 26 ] . to determine the effect of ampa receptor and gaba receptor on gain modulation by nmda , we examined the effects of nmda in the presence of cnqx , an antagonist for ionotropic glutamate ampa receptors , or / and bicuculline methiodide ( bic ) , a competitive antagonist of gabaa receptors , respectively . \n bic ( 10  m ) accelerated the depolarization by nmda application , but bic alone had little effect on the f - i slope . in the presence of bic , \n the mean initial slopes were 276.46  59.4 and 332.6  40.02  hz / na before and during application of...",

    "input": "first described by veterinarians , pythiosis is a serious life- and limb - threatening infection endemic to thailand , but rarely seen in the western hemisphere . \n known to infect immunocompetent horses , dogs , and other large animals,2 , 3 \n pythium infection was first reported in humans in 1989 in association with thalassemic hemoglobinopathy.4 , 5 human pythiosis is known to present in one of four clinical entities : subcutaneous , ocular , vascular , and disseminated . here \n , we present a unique case of vascular pythiosis managed with limb - sparing vascular bypass grafts complicated by pseudoaneurysm formation . \n the patient is a 17 year - old jamaican male with a history of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and severe aplastic anemia refractory to horse anti - thymoglobulin treatment , which was transfusion - dependent . \n one month prior to admission at our institution , he went fishing in a fresh water pond in jamaica and his left lower leg was caught in a bush . on the following day , he noticed a small bullae with a black center and later developed severely painful left inguinal swelling . \n he was admitted to a local hospital for the next several weeks , where all diagnostic testing performed was unremarkable . \n his pain persisted despite antibiotic and antifungal therapy , and he was later transferred to our institution for consideration of bone marrow transplant . on admission , he was a febrile with a white blood cell count of 6.2 ( k/l ) and platelet count of 18 ( k/l ) and was complaining of severe left leg pain . \n he had a 9    8  cm soft tissue defect with overlying escar on the posterior aspect of his left leg ( fig . \n 1a ) , and his exam was also notable for an exquisitely tender and erythematous left inguinal mass . \n motor and sensory exam were intact in both lower extremities without pain upon passive hip flexion . \n several small , dark macules were noted along the lateral aspect of his left foot ( fig . \n mri showed a t2 bright left groin mass with edema along the fascial planes , and lower extremity angiogram demonstrated occlusion of the left common femoral artery with distal profunda femoris and mid - superficial femoral artery reconstitution ( fig . \n the patient was not a candidate for percutaneous intervention , and was taken to the operating room for exploration . \n visual inspection of the common femoral artery after exposure was significant for several patches of necrotic vessel wall . \n initial attempt with thrombectomy was unsuccessful , as the fogarty catheter actually perforated the anterior wall at the areas of necrosis . \n the patient ultimately received an extra - anatomic left external iliac to superficial femoral artery bypass using a nonreversed greater saphenous vein graft , as the external iliac was the closest available inflow that did not visually appear to be involved with the infection . \n intraoperative wound cultures were positive for pythium insidiosum and the patient was started on a combination of voriconazole , terbinafine , and amphotericin b. given his critical condition , an emergency investigational new drug request was drafted for permission to administer a p. insidiosum antigen vaccine available for compassionate use from the pan american veterinary laboratories . \n the vaccine was given once daily in one - week intervals in conjunction with subcutaneously injected interferon gamma ( ifn- ) , for a total of four weeks . \n three weeks after his initial surgery , the patient developed new sites of pain along the graft site and repeat imaging showed a 2.5  cm pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis to the external iliac artery with contrast extravasation ( fig . \n he was taken to the operating room for an extra - anatomic left common iliac artery to the previous femoral popliteal bypass graft using a reverse saphenous vein graft . \n the patient later developed a polymicrobial superinfection of his wounds , and his vascular repair continued to break down leading to increased ischemic pain . \n after several multidisciplinary discussions with the family that all medical interventions were exhausted , and that even highly aggressive surgical measures including hip disarticulation or hemipelvectomy could not guarantee source control , conservative measures were initiated and ultimately , the patient expired . \n this patient presented a major diagnostic challenge , and his disease process and subsequent management were previously unknown to our hospital . \n in retrospect , he presented with a classic case of vascular pythiosis , with an antecedent history of exposure to surface water and exam findings of vascular insufficiency , including pain out of proportion to exam , distal emboli , and an ischemic ulcer . \n the correct infectious diagnosis was not made until 1 month after exposure , after a vascular bypass was already performed . \n indeed , in a large multi - institutional study from thailand with a total of 102 cases of pythiosis , 60 patients received a diagnosis of vascular pythiosis , and only the patients who had undergone amputation survived . \n further review of the literature for reports of vascular pythiosis demonstrated that the majority of patients were treated with amputation without any signs of recurrence , and were followed for 5 to 35 months post - operatively.4 , 6 , 8 , 9 in our case , complete source control was not achieved during the first operation since the common femoral artery and the proximal portion of the superficial femoral artery were oversewn and left in place , standard practice for the treatment of peripheral arterial disease . \n incomplete source control eventually led to development of a pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis and additional surgery . \n while the second repair was cited in previously uninvolved tissue planes , it did not protect against further infection , likely because p. insidiosum is known to invade through proteinase secretion . \n the authors could find no reported cases of confirmed vascular pythiosis treated with limb - sparing procedures.2 , 7 , 11 , 12 medical therapy in the treatment of vascular pythiosis involves antifungal agents , immunotherapy , and iron chelation therapy . \n much of the difficulty in eradicating this organism stems from its complicated phylogenesis;2 , 6 , 14 it shares features with true fungi at the same time it is phylogenetically more closely related to algae and diatomeae . \n p. insidiosum develops mycelium like fungi , but its cell walls do not contain chitin and its cytoplasmic membrane lacks ergosterol , both of which are important targets of traditional antifungal drugs . despite this , drugs that affect cellular permeability , including amphotericin b , terbinafine , and the azoles , have been used with some clinical success.2 , 15 more recently , immunotherapy has been used as an adjunct to surgery and antimycotics . \n immunotherapy was first successfully used in humans in 1998 in a patient with a vascular p. insidiosum infection refractory to surgery and antifungals.2 , 16 a p. insidiosum vaccine delivered twice with a two - week interval resulted in a cure 1 year later . \n data collected from clinical trials and other reports estimate vaccine efficacy to be 5560%.2 , 17 the proposed mechanism of action of the p. insidiosum vaccine is to shift host adaptive immune response from a predominantly t helper 2 ( th2 ) response to a t helper 1 ( th1 ) response.2 , 17 \n pythium exoantigens are typically processed by antigen presenting cells ( apcs ) and presented to nave cd4 helper t cells ( th0 ) . \n this induces th0 cells to adopt a th2 phenotype secreting il-4 and il-5 , which trigger many downstream effects , including mast cell and eosinophil migration to the site of infection with subsequent degranulation , releasing inflammatory mediators and causing tissue damage . \n loss of tissue architecture then creates a more favorable environment for these pathogenic hyphae to take hold . \n conversion of a th2 to th1 response would favor secretion of ifn- and il-2 , leading to increased cytotoxic t lymphocyte recruitment and therefore , direct killing of p. insidiosum . in this case , the purpose of injecting ifn- subcutaneously was to augment a th1 response , and co - administration of gm - csf was to increase the efficiency of exoantigen presentation to apcs . \n another treatment modality used to control this infection is iron chelation therapy . given the association between pythium infection in patients with hemoglobinopathies with a long - standing history of blood transfusions4 , 7 and the discovery of a ferrochelatase gene in p. insidiosum , \n other research efforts have focused on elucidating the role of iron overload in p. insidiosum pathogenesis . \n there is evidence that iron overload from transfusions contributes to derangements in host immunity by impairing lymphocyte function and altering phagocytosis , leading to a more susceptible state for infection6 , 19 a...",

kirby , obasi , & laris , 2006 ) . \n widespread access to testing and treatment facilitated by the president s emergency plan for aids relief ( pepfar ; http://www.usaid.gov/what-we-do/global-health/hiv-and-aids ) have greatly enhanced opportunities to successfully incorporate biomarker procedures into adolescent hiv prevention research designs , since infected individuals identified through testing offered by studies may access free or subsidized hiv treatment and care ( stringer et al . , 2006 ;

cowan et al . \n ; pronyk et al . , 2006 ; ross et al . , 2007 ) , \n most adolescent hiv prevention studies have relied on changes in self - reported sexual behavior to assess intervention effectiveness ( see reviews : cowan & pettifor , 2009 ; michielsen et al . , \n 2010 ) , with audio computer - assisted self - interviews intended to improve veracity ( mensch , erulkar , & hewett , 2003 ) . \n however , biomarker comparisons have suggested that self - reported measures have low validity ( cowan et al . , 2002 ; gavin et al . , 2006 ; mensch , hewett , gregory , & helleringer , 2008 ; palen et al . , 2008 ; plummer et al . , 2004 ) . \n for example , in one study , only one of 16 youth with hiv admitted to ever having sex , and four of the 16 also had either chlamydia or gonorrhea ( cowan et al . , 2002 ) . \n inclusion of a highly prevalent and reliable biomarker of sexual activity in conjunction with self - reported sexual behavior can help to improve reliability of this outcome measure . \n hiv infection is not the most useful biomarker of adolescent sexual activity by itself because of the relatively low prevalence among younger adolescents and the potential for transmission through perinatal and non - sexual blood - borne routes ( amornkul et al . \n , 2009 ; ferrand et al . , 2009 ; stover , walker , grassly , & marston , 2006 ) . \n herpes simplex virus type 2 ( hsv-2 ) , the primary cause of genital herpes , is a commonly used biomarker of sexual activity because the presence of hsv-2 antibodies is highly associated with past sexual behavior ( tobian et al . , 2009 ; van de laar et al . , 1998 ) . \n in contrast to other stis such as chlamydia , gonorrhea , syphilis and trichomoniasis , infection with hsv-2 is life - long , and , once established , there is currently no treatment to eliminate it ( geretti , 2006 ; gupta , warren , & wald , 2008 ) . \n hsv-2 prevalence in the adult general population in sub - saharan africa is high , ranging from 30 to 80  % in women and from 10 to 50  % in men , as assessed by detection of hsv-2 antibodies [ amornkul et al . , 2009 ; \n , 2005 ; munjoma et al . , 2010 ; national aids & sti control programme ( nascop ) , republic of kenya , 2009 ; tobian et al . , 2009 ; weiss , 2004 ] . \n prevalence estimates for adolescents are only available through community - based studies and are lower . \n one study in zimbabwe among adolescent females aged 1519  years reported that 12  % of participants tested positive for hsv-2 ( birdthistle et al . \n a study in western kenya found hsv-2 prevalence to be 9  % for females and 4  % for males aged 1314 , and 28  % for females and 17  % for males aged 1519  years ( amornkul et al . , 2009 ) . \n another study conducted in zimbabwe among adolescents whose mean age was 15  years reported a prevalence estimate of 0.2  % , suggesting a later stage of sexual debut ( cowan et al . \n 2012 ) evaluated the use of hsv-2 as a biomarker of sexual debut among young people aged 1024  years . following a comprehensive review of the literature \n , the authors concluded that the use of hsv-2 as a biomarker for sexual debut is limited because of its low transmissibility and the fact that not all potential sexual partners are infected with the virus . \n building on these findings , our study describes the challenges of collecting hiv and hsv-2 biological data as biomarkers for sexual activity among sub - saharan african youth in prevention trials . \n we present two clinical trial case studies to examine important issues related to adolescent biomarker data collection in two clinical trials in kenya and zimbabwe ( hallfors et al . , \n both studies were school - based , cluster randomized trials testing school support ( including payment of school tuition and school uniforms ) as a structural hiv prevention intervention for adolescent orphans . in both studies , we collected blood samples from participants for hiv and hsv-2 testing , but they differed as follows : we collected samples by venipuncture with results disclosed to participants and their guardians in kenya , whereas in zimbabwe , we collected samples by finger pricks for dried blood spots ( dbs ) and results were not disclosed . the kenya sample ( n  =  837 ) comprised young adolescent male ( 52  % ) and female ( 48  % ) orphans in grades 7 ( 61  % ) and 8 ( 39  % ) enrolled in school in siaya district , nyanza province . \n their mean age was 14.9 ( sd 1.5 ; range 1121  years ) ; 22  % reported ever having had sex . among girls , \n hiv and hsv-2 prevalence was 1  % ( n  =  10 ) and 3  % ( n  =  28 ) , respectively . among those with positive hiv or hsv-2 test results , 70  % ( n  =  7 ) and 64  % ( n  =  18 ) , respectively , reported never having had sex . \n the original sample for the zim...",

surface \n\n interactions . \n material surface \n properties have been studied intensively , but \n still lack from reliable data about cytocompatibility . \n especially , the \n superordinate principles of cellular responses to \n surfaces with a defined \n topography are not well known and poorly understood . \n because many variables \n influence cellular interactions to surface structures , \n it is difficult to draw \n conclusions and formulate general principles for \n nano- and microstructured \n surfaces . \n this review summarizes recent data of effects by nano- and \n microstructured biomaterials and particles in vitro designed for \n orthopaedic application to get a solid \n framework outlining the critical interactions that govern the \n cytocompatibility . \n because biomaterials in orthopaedics are predominantly \n applied on bone , this review is focussed on \n the interactions of osteoblasts \n  and bone - marrow - derived \n cells with structured biomaterials . \n osteoblasts and osteoclasts are mainly \n responsible for the osteointegration of \n nanostructured biomaterials in orthopaedics . \n osteoblasts derive from \n mesenchymal progenitor cells which are localized mainly \n in the bone marrow and \n periosteum . \n they are characterized by cuboidal \n and flat morphology ( diameter about \n 20  m ) , present a large \n amount of rough endoplasmatic reticlum and a large golgi apparatus , \n and are potent to produce osteoid , a collagen i rich matrix \n . \n in addition , these mononuclear cells are also responsible \n for osteoid calcification ( hydroxyapatite ) . \n typical marker proteins for \n osteoblasts are cbfa1/runx2 , osteocalcin , osteopontin , osteonectin , bone \n sialoprotein ( bsp ) , osteoprotegerin \n ( opg ) , collagen i , and alkaline phosphates \n ( alp ) . \n figure 1 \n gives a brief summary of the expression \n of several markers during osteoblast differentiation . \n osteocytes act in a paracrine and mechanosensory manner , and \n can activate osetoblasts and osteoclasts . \n the latter cell type derived from the \n hematopoietic line , has multiple nuclei and is \n responsible for bone resorption . \n its ruffled border is flanked \n by a sealing zone which facilitates local acidification \n and removal of bony \n matrix such as ca , h3po4 , and \n h2co3 \n by endocytosis . \n osteoclasts express \n high levels of tartrate - resistant acid phosphatase \n ( trap ) and cathepsin k. the \n interaction between osteoblasts and osteoclasts is complex . during differentiation , \n the ostoblast progenitors express receptor \n activator of nuclear \n factor  ligand ( rankl ) and macrophage colony - stimulating factor \n ( m - csf ) which are strong stimuli for osteoclastogenesis . \n in contrast , \n osteoprotegerin ( opg ) is a potent inhibitor \n of osteoclasts . \n moreover , the \n interactions between osteoblasts and osteoclasts in vivo are regulated \n by several hormones and cytokines , including parathyroid hormone ( pth ) , \n calcitonin , and il-6 . \n it is generally accepted that the \n three - dimensional surface topography \n ( size , shape , surface texture ) is one of \n the most important parameters that influence cellular reactions \n [ 2 , 1119 ] . \n although many studies have investigated \n cellular reaction to different surface pattern , \n the significance of macro \n structure studies on bone cell behavior is \n questionable since in vivo adhesion \n structures ( e.g. , cell membranes , \n basement membranes ) are comprised of much \n smaller nanometer scale features [ 20 , 21 ] . \n the immature bone is characterized by an average \n inorganic grain size of \n 1050  nm whereas mature bone has an average \n inorganic grain size of 2050  nm \n ( 25  nm in diameter ) \n . \n considering these parameters , modern \n implants for bone application have been \n designed with a smooth surface at the \n nanometer level . \n it was surprising that \n some of these have induced the formation of peri - implant \n fibrous tissue and \n implant loosening in vivo , while other implants with a higher \n degree of roughness showed significant better osteoconductive properties \n [ 2325 ] . \n there are various methods to modify the degree of \n roughness as well as surface energy \n and topography in orthopaedic implants \n . \n typically applied techniques to enhance \n the degree of roughness and promote \n the osteointegrative properties of \n biometals ( e.g. , ti , cocrmo , ss ) are chemical \n etching or anodization and \n \n also sand - blasting , sputter - coating , and machine - tooling . \n the lack of knowledge in cellular reaction to \n nanostructered biomaterials is based \n to a great extent on \n the difficulty in varying surface chemistry and \n topography independently . \n moreover , \n the use of different cell lineages and culture \n conditions makes it difficult to \n compare results from different investigators \n [ 2631 ] \n ( table 1 ) . \n there is also a lack of consensus concerning the \n proper representation of implant surface topography \n . \n one major misunderstanding is the practice of defining a \n surface by its manufacturing process instead of concisely defining the \n topographic measurements [ 17 , 33 ] . \n considering these limitations for interpretation , \n the \n following review gives an overview of cellular \n reactions to surface structures \n of different orthopaedic biomaterials . \n the first step after exposure of any biomaterial \n to a biological environment results in the rapid \n adsorption of proteins to its \n surface . \n the composition , type , amount , and \n conformation of adsorbed proteins regulate the \n secondary phenomena such as \n cellular adherence and protein exchange \n [ 3537 ] \n and also following cellular reactions such as migration , \n proliferation , and differentiation . \n the potency for biomaterials to adsorb \n proteins is influenced by its physiochemical \n\n characteristics such as surface energy or hydrophobicity , \n and is also dependent on \n the local environment ( ph , \n concentration of ions , composition and \n functional groups of proteins , strength \n of solution , temperature ) \n ( vroman effect ) \n ( figures 2 ,   and 3 ) . for inorganic nanocrystals and microstructured \n surfaces \n there are at least two approaches to change \n their hydrophobic surfaces : \n a ligand exchange reaction can replace the original \n hydrophobic surface with \n bifunctional coupling molecules or an inorganic \n coating such as silica ( 1 ) or \n an encapsulation of nanocrystals in an \n  amphiphile organic coating ( 2 ) . \n the first phase of protein adsorption onto a \n biomaterial 's surface is characterized \n by the attachment of small rapidly diffusing \n\n proteins , followed by a progressive replacement by larger \n proteins with a high \n affinity to the substrate . here \n , especially proteins \n with arg - gly - asp ( rgd ) \n containing sequences such as fibronectin or \n vitronectin act as cell receptors \n and have chemotactic or adhesive properties to bone cells . \n in addition , these rgd - peptides \n also have a strong effect on matrix maturation \n and biomineralization [ 4648 ] . \n after conditioning of a naked biomaterial by protein adsorption , cells attach rapidly \n on the protein - coated surface . \n besides the influence of proteins , the \n cellular attachement to a nanostructed surface \n is also influenced by its physiochemical \n properties , especially by the outer functional groups \n [ 30 , 50 , 51 ] ...",

( 2 ) valproyl - coa or a closely related compound as a proximate inhibitor of mitochondrial ureagenesis ; ( 3 ) valproyl - carnitine ester causing a relative carnitine deficiency and ( 4 ) 2,4-dien - vpa inhibiting b - oxidation . \n although , we can not speculate on the mechanisms responsible for the different kinetics of decay of ammonia levels in the presence of down - trending vpa levels we can confidently state that non - elevated hepatic enzymes and hyperammonemia despite carnitine replacement indicated that hepatic damage and carnitine deficiency had very little role in causing the slowly down - trending elevated ammonia levels in the presence of subtherapeutic serum vpa levels . \n hyperammonemia and psychiatric disturbance secondary to valproate use in our case showed a score of 9 by a naranjo algorithm , indicating strong causality with the drug and placing it in causality category of  definite . \n our assessment of a high adverse reaction probability scale was based on the fact that there are previous conclusive reports of hyperammonemia secondary to vpa use with similar psychiatric features as presented in this case report , hyperammonemia occurred only after vpa use and eventually trended down to normal levels with discontinuation of vpa , patients psychiatric disturbance correlated with hyperammonemia , the patient symptomatically improved with drug discontinuation , there are no alternative explanation of hyperammonemia and altered mood in this case , the serum levels of vpa were elevated with concentrations known to be toxic and that toxic effects observed were more severe with high dose and less severe when secondary hyperammonemia decreased . \n this case report suggests that hyperammonemia , which is known to occur in about 50% patients treated with vpa , may have more than one concurrent etiologic mechanism with different decay kinetics which are not related to hepatic damage or carnitine deficiency .",

    "input": "intramammary infection ( mastitis ) is the most common reason for the use of antimicrobials in dairy cows . \n antimicrobials have been used to treat mastitis for more than fifty years , but consensus about the most efficient , safe , and economical treatment is still lacking . \n the concept of evidence - based medicine has been introduced to veterinary medicine   and should apply also to treatment of mastitis . the impact on public health \n the aim of this article is to review current treatments of mastitis during lactation and seek for evidence - based , best practice treatment recommendations for bovine mastitis . \n penetration of substances into milk when administered parenterally or absorption and distribution throughout the udder when infused intramammarily ( imm ) depends on their pharmacokinetic characteristics . \n these are lipid solubility , degree of ionization , extent of binding to serum and udder proteins , and the type of vehicle . \n antimicrobial treatment of dairy cows creates residues into milk , and residue avoidance is an important aspect of mastitis treatment . \n the activity of macrolides , tetracyclines and trimethoprim - sulphonamides has been shown to be reduced in milk . selecting a substance with a low minimum inhibitory concentraton ( mic ) value for the target pathogen \n the antimicrobial should have bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic action , because phagocytosis is impaired in the mammary gland . \n however , activity in vitro does not guarantee efficacy in vivo when treating bovine mastitis . \n antimicrobial resistance amongst mastitis pathogens has not yet emerged as a clinically relevant issue , but geographical regions may differ in this respect . \n the biggest problem is the widespread resistance of staphylococci , particularly staphylococcus aureus , to penicillin g . \n cure rates for mastitis caused by penicillin - resistant strains of s. aureus seem to be inferior to those of mastitis due to penicillin - susceptible strains . \n it is not known if this is due to pharmacologic problems of the drugs used , or virulence factors possibly linked to -lactamase gene of the resistant isolates . using an in vitro -lactamase test for determining resistance to penicillin g of staphylococci before treatment \n coagulase - negative staphylococci tend to be more resistant than s. aureus and easily develop multiresistance . \n mastitis causing streptococci have remained susceptible to penicillin g , but emerging resistance to macrolides and lincosamides has been detected . \n antimicrobial susceptibility of coliform bacteria varies but normally is not a limiting factor for therapy . \n an important question regarding the treatment of mastitis is whether the antimicrobial should accumulate in the milk or in the udder tissue . \n the target site may depend on the causative agent : streptococci are known to remain in the milk compartment , but s. aureus penetrates udder tissue and causes deep infection ( table 1 ) . \n the advantages of this route are high concentrations of the substance achieved in the milk and low consumption of the antimicrobial as the drug is directly infused into the diseased quarter . \n for example , concentration of penicillin g in milk after imm administration is 100 - 1000 times as high as the concentration after systemic ( parenteral ) administration . \n a disadvantage of the imm administration is uneven distribution throughout the udder   and the risk of infecting the quarter when infusing the product via the teat canal . \n efficacy of imm treatment varies according to the causative pathogen , with the best therapeutic response being shown for mastitis caused by streptococci , coagulase - negative staphylococci , and corynebacterium spp .. where to target antimicrobial therapy in clinical mastitis due to different pathogens   the systemic route of administration has been suggested to be more efficient than imm for the treatment of clinical mastitis as antimicrobials theoretically have better penetration of the udder tissue by this route . \n however , it is difficult to attain and maintain therapeutic concentrations in milk or udder tissue following systemic administration . \n many commonly used broad - spectrum antimicrobials such as oxytetracycline , trimethoprim - sulphonamide and ceftiofur , it is difficult to produce and maintain therapeutic concentrations in the milk . \n macrolides would have ideal pharmacokinetics , but clinical studies have failed to demonstrate efficacy when used for the systemic treatment of clinical mastitis . in streptococcal mastitis , spiramycin and tylosin have shown reasonable efficacy . \n one additional problem for the bovine practitioner is that the recommended dosage for many antibiotic preparations for adult cattle may be too low when pharmacological aspects are considered , but residue studies have been carried out using the approved dosages . \n repeated intramuscular injections of large volumes of antibiotics can be irritating and can not be recommended from the animal welfare point of view . \n one substance used for systemic treatment is penicillin g , which as a weak acid penetrates poorly into the mammary gland , however , due to the very low mic values of susceptible organisms , therapeutic concentrations can be achieved in milk . \n penethamate is a more liphophilic penicillin g formulation and diffuses better than penicillin g procaine into milk . \n the efficacy of systemic treatment with penicillin g or penethamate has been shown in clinical trials . \n combinations of penicillin and aminoglycosides should not be used , as there is no scientific evidence demonstrating a better efficacy for the combination   and aminoglycosides are known to produce long - lasting residues . \n the only type of mastitis where systemic treatment would be clearly advantageous may be mastitis caused by s. aureus . \n in severe mastitis due to coliform bacteria , parenteral administration of antimicrobials has been suggested to combat bacteraemia . \n the general benefit of antimicrobial treatment in coliform mastitis has been questioned , but systemic antimicrobial treatment is recommended in cases of severe escherichia coli mastitis with heavy bacterial growth in the udder . \n fluroquinolones and cefquinome have shown efficacy in experimental trials   and ceftiofur in a clinical field trial . \n there is no evidence that administering bactericidal antimicrobials to cows with severe coliform mastitis causes the release of massive amounts of endotoxin . \n finally , the antimicrobial used for systemic treatment of mastitis must be approved for dairy cattle . \n for example , penicillin g procaine or fluoroquinolones are not approved for dairy cattle in the united states . \n treatment of mastitis should be targeted towards the causative bacteria whenever possible , but in acute situations , treatment is initiated based on herd data and personal experience . rapid or on - farm bacteriological diagnosis would facilitate the selection of the most appropriate antimicrobial . \n treatment protocols and drug selection for each farm should be made by veterinarians familiar with the farm . \n the use of on -

    "input": "approximately 40 million people are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) worldwide ( unaids 2006 ) . \n infections by this lentivirus from the family retroviridae are characterized by a long asymptomatic period after host immune defenses control the initial infection . during this subsequent chronic phase of infection , hiv slowly diminishes the host \n the virus replicates by hijacking the intracellular molecular machinery to transcribe viral rna , and eventually the productively infected cells die ( fauci 1988 ) . over time , the density of virions in the blood stream increases and the immune system functioning becomes progressively compromised , leaving hiv - infected individuals increasingly susceptible to opportunistic infections . \n being blood - borne , hiv is transmitted via contact with the blood of an infected individual : through transfusions , needle - sharing , sexual contact or from mother to child during childbirth or breast - feeding . \n initially there were concerns that hiv might be vector - borne ( e.g. , transmitted via mosquitoes ) but it has since become widely accepted that such transmission does not occur at any significant level ( bockarie and paru 1996 ) . \n this current belief stems both from epidemiological data and experimental studies that directly examine the potential for hiv transmission via arthropods ( lawrence 1987 ; lifson 1988 ; bockarie and paru 1996 ) \n . why is hiv not vector - borne ( throughout this article we use the term  vector synonymously with \n arthropod ) ? the majority of medical scientists , when asked this question , will offer the following explanations ( bockarie and paru 1996 ) : ( i ) hiv concentrations in the blood are too low during human infection to permit vector transmission ; ( ii ) hiv is unable to survive long enough outside of humans ( or primates ) for vector transmission ; ( iii ) hiv is not able to replicate within arthropod vectors . \n each of these explanations has empirical support ( lifson 1988 ; bockarie and paru 1996 ) and thus all three are good explanations for the lack of vector transmission in hiv . \n if most arthropods pick up very little hiv when feeding on humans , and if the level of hiv in ( or on ) these vectors quickly decays , then no significant vector transmission is expected to occur . \n the above findings provide a satisfying proximate explanation for the lack of vector transmission in hiv . \n given the current characteristics of hiv , these three features of the virus make it unlikely that vector transmission will occur . in this article , we approach this question from an evolutionary perspective . therefore , rather than taking the characteristics of hiv as given , we are interested in understanding why hiv has evolved these particular features and not others instead . for example : \n ( i ) why has hiv not evolved a replication strategy that results in viral concentrations high enough to allow vector transmission ? ( ii ) why has hiv not evolved to be more durable and thus to survive longer outside of humans ? \n ( iii ) why has hiv not evolved the ability to replicate in arthropod vectors ? \n asking such questions might strike many readers as strange since much of evolutionary biology proceeds by asking why certain features of organisms are as we observe them rather than by asking why some features are absent . \n this is only natural , since it is difficult to decide which , among the infinite number of  missing features , should be the focus of study . \n it is useful to view such questions as falling on a continuum , from questions about the lack of traits that are virtually non - existent in all taxa ( e.g. , why do dogs not have wheeled appendages ) to questions about the lack of traits that are common in some populations or species but not others ( e.g. , why do german shepherds not have curly hair ? ) . \n our contention is that , by asking such questions about the absence of some traits , we can gain deeper insight into biology . to quote philosopher arthur eddington ( 1927 ) ,   the contemplation in natural science of a wider domain than the actual leads to a far better understanding of the actual .  . as in all science , however , not all questions are interesting , and this serves as our primary guide for focusing on some missing features and not others . in particular , we focus on the lack of vector transmission in hiv , because of the profound epidemiological significance of its absence . \n an arthropod - transmissible form of hiv would clearly exacerbate the already devastating impact of the disease , opening up routes of transmission to groups previously at low - risk ( e.g. , children ) . \n therefore , it is worth asking why , from an evolutionary standpoint , this has not occurred ( weiss 2001 ) . \n more to the point , if there are conditions under which hiv could have evolved vector transmission we would do well to understand these , not only from the standpoint of scientific curiosity , but also to prevent such an outcome in the future . in this article , we address the question of why hiv lacks vector transmission , both through a consideration of available empirical data and through the construction of mathematical models . although our results are necessarily speculative , we believe that they shed some light on the evolutionary biology of hiv , and on the evolutionary biology of blood - borne pathogens more generally . \n there are two broad reasons why a trait of interest ( in this case vector - transmission ) might not evolve . \n first , the necessary genetic variation for the trait might arise only very rarely ( if at all ) . \n for instance , the evolution of rna viruses , such as hiv , could be strongly constrained by the size of their genome ( holmes 2003 ) . \n second , the necessary form and strength of natural selection might not be present for the trait to evolve , at least over the timescale under consideration . \n thus , from an evolutionary standpoint , hiv is not vector - borne because either the necessary genetic variation for such transmission has never arisen , or the necessary selective factors that would make such variants increase in frequency over the relevant timescale have not occurred . \n our evolutionary explanation for why hiv is not vector - borne will be sought within these two possibilities . before beginning to consider these explanations \n there are two different processes that might result in vector - transmission , and that are often lumped under this single heading . \n this occurs when the arthropod acts solely as a means of physical transport of viral particles between hosts ( e.g. , having viral particles in and around mouthparts ) . \n this occurs when the virus replicates within the arthropod vector during the time period between feeding events . \n how likely is it that hiv has not evolved vector transmission because of a lack of appropriate genetic variation ? the most direct way to assess this possibility is to determine if genetic variants capable of vector transmission are currently present in the hiv population . \n unfortunately , performing such an assay on all genotypes within the population would be next to impossible . \n furthermore , if variants capable of vector transmission are selectively disadvantageous , then their frequency in the population might be extremely low . nevertheless , there are some studies available that take this approach as far as is possible . a second approach to addressing this issue \n if some of hivs close relatives have evolved vector - transmission , then the premise that genetic variation for this route of transmission in hiv does not exist would be significantly weakened . \n below we review both types of evidence , for both mechanical and biological transmission . mechanical transmission : \n a number of studies working directly with hiv have assayed its ability to be transmitted mechanically by arthropods . \n such transmission is often difficult to assess under natural conditions , and therefore most studies have employed artificial experimental setups , using a variety of arthropods including mosquitoes , stable flies , and tabanids ( e.g. , horse flies and deer flies ) . \n for example , hiv was found to be viable for up to 10 days in african soft ticks , and perhaps even up to 14 days ( humphrey - smith et al . \n 1989 found that hiv can remain infectious for up to 8 days in the gut of cimex hemipterus . \n most research on this topic has stressed the need for large bloodmeal size , however , because hiv tends not to have a very high viral titre during infection in humans ( lifson 1988 ; webb et al . \n this has led to a focus on arthropods , like ticks , whose bloodmeal sizes are often 70 times larger than that of mosquitoes ( humphrey - smith et al . 1993 ) . \n it has also been suggested that squashing mosquitoes while they are feeding , and subsequently scratching the area ( which might result in lacerations ) could increase ...",

ms analysis sodium borodeuteride was employed , which allowed further the discrimination between the sugar released by -elimination and those linked to other sugars previously . in fig \n .  1 monosaccharide constituents of the core trisaccharide representing the main structure found in a. lusitanicus , with a pseudomolecular mass ( [ m+h ] ) of m / z 576.3  da , were determined by gc - ms of the corresponding alditol acetates and identified on the basis of retention times in gc and their characteristic electron impact ( ei ) mass spectra . \n the results revealed the presence of a galnac - residue which was h - reduced , while all the other sugars were h reduced . \n therefore , galnac can be considered as the protein bound sugar . the high amount of 4-o - me - gal indicated that this residue is the one which is mainly involved in the elongation of the glycan . \n minor compounds were identified as contaminations by n -

assisted laser desorption / ionization time - of - flight mass spectrometry ( maldi - tof ) . \n a 38-year - old man was admitted to our hospital with a 2 days history of fever , malaise and cellulitis around a mitrofanoff abdominal catheter . \n multiple comorbidities included marfan syndrome ( with metallic aortic valve inserted sixteen years before ) and congenital urological abnormalities that led to the mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy and a recent renal transplant , five years and six months before admission respectively . \n he was on steroids and tacrolimus as immunosuppressive therapy . on presentation , the patient was febrile , hypotensive and tachycardic , had a normal leukocyte count ( 5.0910/l ) but raised creactive protein ( crp ) 45 \n mg / l with mild anaemia ( hb of 10.1 g / dl from a baseline of 14.6 g / dl ) and renal impairment ( creatinine 163 umol / l and urea 8.1 mmol / l ) . \n the cellulitis around the mitrofanoff abdominal catheter was noted and a swab was taken for culture . \n his chest x - ray did not show any relevant consolidation and abdominal ultrasound noted two small abdominal collections that had already been noted post - transplant and had since decreased in size . \n the patient was documented to be penicillin allergic ( previous skin rash ) , so was initiated on ertapenem iv 1 gr / od . the cellulitis improved and the patient was clinically well within 48 hours of commencing antibiotics . \n the blood culture set ( aerobic and anaerobic bottles ) taken on admission was positive with p. multocida but the abdominal swab grew only mixed anaerobes . \n urine culture was negative and all subsequent blood cultures taken after starting ertapenem were negative after 5 days of incubation . \n transesophageal ( tee ) echocardiography revealed the presence of a vegetation ( 0.57 0.2 cm ) above the atrium of the right coronary artery . \n a previous transthoracic echocardiogram ( tte ) , around one month prior to admission , was reported as negative . \n therefore , the patient was treated following our local protocol for infective endocarditis : he was switched to ceftriaxone iv 2 gr / od , a picc line was inserted in the right arm and he was discharged under the opat ( outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy ) service to complete six weeks iv antibiotics as an outpatient . on follow - up , two repeat ttes showed clear aortic valve . \n we reviewed all the previous reported cases of p. multocida endocarditis in the literature through pubmed and cross - references search . \n to our knowledge this is the twenty - first reported case of endocarditis but the first to be reported in a penicillin allergic patient . as with previous cases , \n the diagnosis of infective endocarditis was made according to duke criteria : one major criterion ( evidence of endocardial involvement ) and three minor criteria ( predisposing heart condition , fever and microbiological evidence with positive blood culture ) . \n laboratory isolation and identification of p. multocida was performed using standard microbiological techniques : api-20ne , api-20e ( biomerieux ) and the phoenix automated system ( bd ) . \n interestingly , both api profiles reported a low confidence value for identification as p. multocida to the species level ( cv 53% ) and the phoenix assay only identified the isolate to genus level as pasteurella spp . thus , confirmation of species identification was performed using 16s rrna sequencing and maldi - tof protein profiling : 16s rrna sequence was performed using pcr parameters detailed in maskell na et al . \n ( 2006 ) and we obtained a 584bp fragment sharing 99% sequence homology to that of p. multocida sub species septica . \n maldi - tof profiling was performed using a bruker daltonics microflex platform with recommended -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix under pre - defined conditions as specified by bruker . \n the maldi - tof mass spectra for the clinical isolate was analysed against maldi - tof mass spectra for 3,438 species of bacteria located in the bruker daltonics flexanalysis 3.0 database . \n the clinical isolate was identified as p. multocida with a confidence value of 2.321 indicating highly probable species identification , with no differential bacterial species being reported . \n sensitivities were as follow ( eucast breakpoints ) : penicillin mic ( mg / l ) was 0.19 , ciprofloxacin 0.016 , doxycycline 0.5 , co - trimoxazole 0.032 , ertapenem 0.016 and ceftriaxone < 0.016 , all being susceptible . of note \n the accuracy of previous reports in the literature has been questioned as their standard microbiological description was incomplete and pasteurella species may be misidentified as haemophilus spp . \n they both belong to the pasteurellaceae family and based on the genomic sequence it appears they diverged approximately 270 million years ago . \n are gram - negative coccobacilli generally present in the oral cavity of cats and dogs . to date twenty - one species \n have been identified and the species p. multocida can be further divided into three different subspecies ( subspecies multocida , septicum and gallicida ) . \n the spectrum of infections varies from skin and soft tissue to central nervous system infections . \n ten out of twenty - one ( 47.6% ) endocarditis cases described in the literature had close contact with animals detailed in the clinical history . \n our patient did not have a clear history of bites or scratches but he did have two cats at home and close contact with dogs at his sister 's house . \n in fact , of the cases of p. multocida endocarditis reviewed , two out of twenty - one ( 9.5% ) had cirrhosis as underlying condition . \n penicillin still remains the best antimicrobial agent for the treatment of virtually all forms of pasteurella infection . \n a fluoroquinolone , doxycycline , or co - trimoxazole should be considered for skin and soft tissue infections as an alternative for patients with intolerance to -lactams . there are no clear guidelines about the treatment of p. multocida endocarditis in penicillin - allergic patients . \n the patient was known to be penicillin allergic ( previous rash ) and ciprofloxacin and doxycycline were contraindicated as causing interaction with his anticoagulant treatment . \n we decided then to switch to ceftriaxone as this antibiotic is already vastly used in the treatment of endocarditis caused by other gram - negative organisms and is more cost effective . \n aminoglycosides have moderate to poor in vitro activity against pasteurella and probably should not be used , particularly given the paucity of clinical experience . finally , our patient improved within 48 hours of commencing antimicrobial therapy and surgical intervention was unnecessary . from the literature , \n only three other cases have been successfully treated with solely antibiotics and valve replacement was mandatory in seventeen out of twenty - one ( 81% ) of cases described . \n clinicians may face various challenges , from achieving the correct species identification to chosing treatment regimens in penicillin - allergic patients . in our case new diagnostic techniques such as 16s rrna sequencing and maldi - tof were demonstrated to be invaluable tools for species confirmation . \n we propose that maldi - tof is a rapid , accurate method for the identification of p. multocida from bacterial cultures and can significantly reduce the time to diagnosis of p. multocida bacteraemia . \n furthermore we have shown that cephalosporins and carbapenems are probably good substitutes for penicillin in case of allergy .",

    "input": "while advances in free trade and globalization increase the movement and accelerate the accumulation of invasive species ( lockwood et al . \n 2005 ) , it is still unclear how introduced populations can successfully establish . as elton ( 1958 ) pointed out , for every successful invasion that occurs ,  there are enormously more invasions that never happen , or fail quite soon or even after a good many years ( page 109 ) . \n this modern biological paradox can not readily be reconciled , especially in the characteristic case where the founder population is small , as  such populations are definitely in a precarious position ( mayr 1965 ; page 42 ) . \n introductions of populations at low density and/or small size are often faced with inverse density dependent effects , attributed to demographic stochasticity or reduced cooperative interactions ( courchamp et al . \n allee ( 1931 ) first proposed that under these conditions , populations may suffer a decrease in the per - capita rate of increase , from here on referred to as the allee effect . upon arrival in a novel environment , individuals need to overcome a series of challenges in order to reduce the population 's risk of extinction . \n the time period in which this occurs is generally considered the initial establishment phase , and is thought to be a common feature and general pattern of invasion and the process of growth and expansion ( shigesada and kawasaki 1997 ; sakai et al . \n the occurrence of a lag phase that precedes a noticeable increase in population growth and density can result from ecological and/or evolutionary phenomena ( sakai et al . \n small populations that undergo logistic growth slowly increase through the initial phase of the exponential curve , leading to the perception of a time lag . \n where this time lag is more pronounced , populations may be recovering from inverse density dependent effects ( i.e. , allee effects ) . \n individuals may suffer a reduction in fitness at low densities for many reasons ( reviewed by courchamp et al . \n even when the initial population is large , rapid dispersal required for expansion could be suicidal as the population density decreases , thereby enhancing inverse density dependent effects ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ; drake et al . \n component allee effect where the population size and density affects the mean overall fitness or some component of individual fitness , respectively ( stephens et al . 1999 ; gascoigne et al . \n it is often difficult to decipher the exact mechanism that manifests allee effects ( and it is not always the case that component allee effects lead to demographic allee effects ) . \n nevertheless , we focus our attention on population level demographic allee effects with the underlying assumption that a component allee effect led to the demographic allee effect . essentially , it is the case that introduced individuals may be maladapted to small population sizes where their survival and reproductive ability are significantly impacted , and these impacts on individual fitness combine to produce an overall decrease in abundance ( i.e. , demographic allee effects ) . as allee effects impact individual fitness , the underlying traits that influence these effects ( \n i.e. , component allee effects ) may be subject to natural selection ( courchamp et al . 2008 ) . whereas propagule pressure is an emerging explanation for the establishment of invasive species ( lockwood et al . 2005 ) , it relies on an obvious relationship between the number and size of introduction events and the probability of success , as safety in numbers helps combat allee effects and stochastic extinction . in the event that propagule size is not large enough to overcome inverse density dependent effects , a population \n traits that may be responsible for reproductive success and survival at small population densities and sizes include mate finding cues ( pheromones and vocal / visual signals ) , dispersal / aggregation behavior , habitat preferences , mating synchronicity , and gamete morphology and performance ( see courchamp et al . \n direct evidence for the evolution of these traits as functional adaptations to allee effects is limited , but we can infer an adaptive evolutionary origin of these traits from studies of sexual selection ( courchamp et al . 2008 ; gascoigne et al . \n an evolutionary response to intensive selection pressure imposed by density dependent survival and reproduction relies on genetic variants for adaptive evolution . \n according to neutral quantitative genetic theory , a loss of genetic variation is expected from population bottlenecks and founder effects ( nei et al . \n however it is not neutral variation that matters , but rather evolvability depends on the variation relevant to selection . \n maintenance or even increases of this ( additive ) genetic variation has been theoretically and empirically observed following a bottleneck or in small founder populations ( bryant et al . \n 1986 ; goodnight 1988 ; willis and orr 1993 ; cheverud and routman 1996 ; briggs and goldman 2006 ; turelli and barton 2006 ) . \n additionally , many recent studies suggest that there is actually no significant reduction in genetic diversity in most successful invaders ( lee 2002 ; allendorf and lundquist 2003 ; roman and darling 2007 and references therein ) , and that evolution can occur on contemporary timescales ( reznick and ghalambor 2001 ; carroll et al . 2007 ; kinnison and hairston 2007 ) . \n our purpose here is to explore the feasibility of small populations that may adaptively respond to overcome allee effects in order to establish , given any amount of genetic variation . in this paper \n , we present evidence for the enhanced potential for growth and spread of a small introduced population of organisms faced with allee effects when adaptation occurs . \n we model the growth and spread of this population according to a reaction - diffusion equation , and allow evolution to influence inverse density dependent effects through a genetic subsystem that provides the opportunity for successful invasion when otherwise ( under the current , ecological paradigm ) the population would go extinct . \n the deterministic model that we explore in this paper broadly describes population dynamics with density - mediated growth ( i.e. , an allee effect ) and diffusive dispersal . \n this type of demographic model has been used as a compact and tractable representation of invasion ( e.g. , skellam 1951 ; lewis and kareiva 1993 ) . \n specifically , it has been applied to systems such as introductions of nonindigenous freshwater and marine species through ballast water discharge ( drake et al . \n 2005 ; drury et al . 2007 ) . using this approach , drake et al . \n ( 2005 ) report acceptable volumes of discharge for various organisms ( with differing reproductive rates ) for a range of invasion risk tolerances . here \n , we consider populations that are introduced below the invasion risk threshold , but nonetheless succeed if evolutionary dynamics are considered in conjunction with the ecological system . \n the growth and spread of an introduced population of organisms is represented by a reaction - diffusion equation described by ( lewis and kareiva 1993 ) : which determines the rate of change in the local population density relative to the carrying capacity [ u which denotes u(x , t ) ] over time , at a point in space . \n this equation models the growth of the population ( the first term on the right hand side of eqn . \n 1 ) at a spatial location that is subject to an allee effect in addition to migration ( which depends on the second term on the rhs of eqn . \n 1 ) . the diffusion coefficient ( d ) scales the rate of population spread , in this case across a one - dimensional habitat x. the reproductive rate is regulated by r , and a ( which is a function of space and time , derived below ) is the local critical density or allee threshold that determines if population growth is positive or negative ( fig . \n growth dynamics of the model population ( a ) , and the solution of eqn . \n ( 1 ) without diffusion ( b ) with reproductive rate , r = 0.6 , and allee threshold , a = 0.3 . \n trajectories for population size ( b ) are given for initial densities from 0 to 1 in increments of 0.05 . \n there are many variations of single - species models of population dynamics that exhibit allee effects ( see table 1 of boukal and berec 2002 ) , however the growth function of eqn . \n the behavior of this verhulst ( 1838 ) logistic model modified to include a nonlinear cubic term ( based on the fitzhugh - nagumo equations ;

confirmed incidence and prevalence of cti from the developing world as well . \n the available indian data show a wide variation in ct prevalence with infection rates in indian women ranging from 3.3% to 33% depending on the population sampled [ 413 ] . \n infection with this agent is usually asymptomatic in up to 80% of women which makes diagnosis and detection all the more difficult . left undetected and untreated the infection may evolve into pelvic inflammatory disease and may result in serious sequelae , such as ectopic pregnancy and infertility [ 14 , 15 ] . \n cti in women has also been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes like recurrent miscarriage and preterm labor and may cause conjunctivitis , nasopharyngitis , and pneumonia in newborns by vertical transmission . because the infection is easily treatable with antibiotics , early detection and treatment of infected individuals \n are the key to prevent adverse sequelae among those infected and reduce c. trachomatis transmission . \n thus , it is important to screen adolescents and sexually active women for cti even if they are asymptomatic [ 17 , 18 ] . but , in the developing countries with the exception of sporadic testing , screening for chlamydia is rarely done . \n epidemiological studies have also shown that untreated genital chlamydia infection can lead to an increased risk for heterosexual acquisition of hiv . hence , screening for cti done in high risk populations can assist in designing hiv risk reduction strategies . \n on the other hand , immunosuppression due to hiv may lead to more aggressive chlamydia disease conditions like pid in hiv seropositive women . \n thus , screening for cti in hiv seropositive women is highly recommended to prevent morbidity associated with the disease and devastating clinical consequences . \n different diagnostic modalities for detection of cti like serology , culture method , elisa for antigen and antibody , direct fluorescence assay ( dfa ) and nucleic acid amplification tests ( naats ) have been used in the last 20 years but none of them are 100% sensitive . \n table 1 shows the prevalence of cti detected by using different diagnostic techniques in new delhi population . \n polymerase chain reaction is an accurate , rapid , and reliable method for the detection of chlamydia trachomatis . \n real - time pcr has increasingly been used and is easier to perform and faster , and since it is performed in a closed system it is less prone to contamination than the conventional pcr . keeping the above background in mind this study was undertaken to generate reliable data regarding prevalence of cti in hiv - infected and hiv - uninfected women by real - time pcr , the most sensitive and specific test available currently for diagnosing genital chlamydia infection . \n the primary objective of this study was to establish the need for screening hiv seropositive women for cti . \n study subjects were recruited as follows : thirty adult hiv seropositive women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a1),thirty adult hiv seropositive women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a2),thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b1),thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b2 ) . \n thirty adult hiv seropositive women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a1 ) , thirty adult hiv seropositive women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( study group a2 ) , thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women with symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b1 ) , thirty age and sex matched adult hiv seronegative women without symptoms suggestive of rtis ( control group b2 ) . \n all the study subjects were enrolled from the integrated counseling and testing center ( ictc ) for hiv / aids , department of microbiology , maulana azad medical college , which is attached to the lok nayak hospital , new delhi . \n this study was conducted prospectively between july 2010 and january 2011 at the hiv molecular laboratory of the department of microbiology , maulana azad medical college . \n this was a cross - sectional analysis to determine the prevalence of chlamydia trachomatis infection by using real - time pcr in hiv seropositive and seronegative , symptomatic , and asymptomatic women visiting the ictc of our department . \n subjects were enrolled in this study following institutional ethical committee clearance and a written informed consent of all participants . each participant was interviewed using a questionnaire concerning general sociodemographic information , personal details , and clinical symptoms . \n subjects having one or more of the following symptoms were considered symptomatic for rti : vaginal discharge , vesicular and/or nonvesicular genital ulcers , inguinal bubo , lower abdominal pain , genital skin conditions , urinary burning or frequency , dysmenorrhea , menorrhagia , and intermenstrual bleeding . \n vesicular and/or nonvesicular genital ulcers , lower abdominal pain , genital skin conditions , urinary burning or frequency , dysmenorrhea , menorrhagia , and intermenstrual bleeding . \n each study subject then underwent a general physical , per abdomen , per speculum , and per vaginum examination . \n diagnosis of hiv infection was done by following the standard protocol at our ictc that employs pretest and posttest counseling and obtains informed consent before hiv testing . \n three different rapid tests were used to detect hiv-1 and hiv-2 antibodies ( combaids ( span diagnostics ltd . ) , retrocheck hiv ( qualpro diagnostics ) , and tri - line ( rapid diagnostics ) ) following the manufacturer 's instructions . \n one endocervical swab was collected from all participants according to the instructions provided in the specimen collection and transport kit ( amplicor std swab collection and transport set ) for detection of chlamydia trachomatis by real - time pcr . \n genital c. trachomatis infection was diagnosed by using cobas taqman ct test , v2.0 , an in vitro nucleic acid amplification test for the qualitative detection of chlamydia trachomatis dna in female endocervical swab specimens . \n specimens were processed using the amplicor ct / ng specimen preparation kit for manual specimen preparation and the cobas taqman 48 analyzer for automated amplification and detection ( roche diagnostics ) . \n the age and gender profile of all the participants is shown in table 2 . in both the hiv seropositive study group and the hiv seronegative control group \n the mean age of hiv - infected cases was found to be 30.92  5.7 years and in hiv - uninfected controls 28.52  6.9 years . \n table 3 shows the presenting complaints of the symptomatic women in both the hiv seropositive study group and the hiv seronegative control group . \n vaginal discharge and lower abdominal pain were the most common presenting complaints amongst the symptomatic participants . \n table 4 shows the sti / rti syndromes diagnosed in study subjects on per speculum examination . \n vaginitis was the most common syndrome diagnosed in both the study and the control groups . \n table 5 shows the correlation between presence of symptoms and cti in the study and the control groups . \n chlamydia trachomatis infection was more commonly diagnosed in the asymptomatic hiv seropositive study subjects as compared to the symptomatic hiv seropositive study subjects . in our study \n the prevalence of cti was higher in hiv seropositive women as compared to hiv seronegative women ( or 4.214 ; 95% ci 0.45738.865 ) and among the hiv positive asymptomatic as compared to the hiv negative asymptomatic ( or 2.111 ; 95% ci 1.6062.776 ) , although the differences were not found to be statistically significant ( table 6 ) . \n in india stis / rtis and hiv / aids are major public health problems . incidence and prevalence data have a key role in control strategies for hiv and stis . \n comprehensive baseline information on the epidemiology of stis is essential for the design , implementation , and monitoring of successful control programs to reduce their incidence . \n routine surveillance of stis / rtis is not carried out in our country due to the lack of laboratory diagnostic facilities , limited resources , stigma , and discrimination a...",

    "input": "multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( mcsm ) is a serious disease which can lead to spinal cord dysfunction and a substantial decrease in quality of life . in addition , mcsm requiring multilevel cervical spine surgery can be accompanied by extensive blood loss . as spinal surgery has become increasingly complex , so control of perioperative bleeding has become an important clinical issue for spine surgeons . \n excessive blood loss can lead to a range of comorbidities such as anemia , hypotension , hematoma formation , and inadequate oxygenation of organs , thereby affecting patient outcome . \n excessive blood loss often requires allogeneic blood transfusion , the risks of which are numerous and among which immunological reactions and transmission of viruses are considered the most serious . in addition , hematoma formation within a few millimeters of the spinal canal can cause considerable neurological damage . \n although occurrences of postoperative spinal hematoma formation requiring emergency surgery are rare , it is nevertheless important to control perioperative bleeding to decrease its incidence . tranexamic acid ( txa ) is a synthetic derivative of the amino acid lysine which operates through competitive inhibition of the activation of plasminogen to plasmin by binding specific sites on both plasminogen and plasmin , thereby retarding fibrinolysis , the degradation of blood clots . \n it has been widely used in various medical fields such as cardiac surgery , gynecology , dentistry , urological surgery , and liver transplantation to reduce the perioperative blood loss , as it is relatively inexpensive and has not been cited in the literature as causing any significant untoward side effects . in addition , txa has been reported to reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements during orthopedic surgery , most commonly in knee and hip joint replacement . although the benefits of txa in spinal surgery have been reported \n indeed , there are no studies of txa in cervical laminectomy with lateral mass screw fixation and bone grafting ( clf ) so far . \n clf has been widely used for many years for treating mcsm caused by multilevel cervical spinal cord compression . \n although some authors suggest that laminoplasty is superior to laminectomy with lateral mass screw fixation and bone grafting regarding preserved range of motion , indications for the use of clf are broader than that of laminoplasty and recent studies showed good outcomes for clf . thus , the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of txa in controlling blood loss during clf for the treatment of mcsm . \n a retrospective comparative analysis was performed in patients with mcsm undergoing clf of vertebrae c3 to c6 . \n patients with cirrhosis of the liver , serious cardiac disease , chronic renal failure , cancer , allergy to txa , a history of thromboembolic disease ( deep vein thrombosis , ischemic heart disease , pulmonary embolism , transient ischemic attack , strokes , or subarachnoid hemorrhage ) , bleeding disorders , hypercoagulation status , disseminated intravascular coagulation , pregnancy , combined anterior and posterior spinal fusions , patients receiving antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant therapy at the time of the study , and treatments of vertebrae outside of c3 to c6 were excluded from the study . between november 2014 and april 2016 , 119 clfs fitting the inclusion criteria were performed in our center . each surgeon ( hao , liu , he , wu , wang , zheng , and zhao ) in this study had more than 20 years of experience in spinal surgery . \n the control group consisted of 46 patients who underwent clf for the treatment of mcsm in our institution without being given txa . in both groups \n , we analyzed patient demographic trait ( age at surgery , gender , body weight , height , and body mass index ) and duration of surgery which was defined as the time from the initial incision to the completion of wound closure . \n the quantity of intraoperative and postoperative blood loss and the preoperative and day 1 postoperative hematological data for each patient were obtained in the 2 groups . \n total blood loss was calculated as the sum of intraoperative and postoperative blood loss ( the quantity during the 1st 16  hours ) . \n the spinous processes , lamina , and lateral mass facet complexes were exposed using a standard posterior midline opening after longitudinally dividing the nuchal fascia in line with a midline skin incision . \n laminectomy was performed using a high speed matchstick burr to drill troughs in the bone at the lateral edge of the lamina on each side , prior to complete removal of the entire lamina and associated ligamentum flavum of the target vertebrae ( c3c6 ) . \n the excised lamina and spinous processes were cleaned of soft tissue and cut into pieces for use as autograft material . \n lateral mass screws were placed bilaterally on vertebrae c3 to c6 then fixed with rods using the margerl technique . \n all patients in the txa group were given a dose of 15  mg / kg of txa ( transamin ; daiichi pharmaceutical , tokyo , japan ) before a skin incision was made , followed immediately with a maintenance dose of 100  mg / hour , and continued until wound closure . \n no patient in the control group received intraoperative administration of txa or any other antifibrinolytic drug . \n continuous variable data were presented as mean and standard deviation while categorical variable data were presented as a number and its specific value . \n statistical differences between the 2 experimental groups were compared using a chi - square test or fisher exact test for categorical variables and

he had been admitted to the neurology ward due to herpetic encephalitis 1 month previous to the occurrence of visual symptoms . \n herpetic encephalitis diagnosis was made by brain mri ( fig . 1 ) and pcr analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid . \n he did not report any underlying disease or drug consumption except oral acyclovir 800 mg every 8 h. at physical examination , the right eye was normal . in the left eye , \n visual acuity was 0.1 , papillary reflex was normal and marcus gunn sign was negative . \n slit lamp examination of the left eye revealed conjunctival hyperemia and ciliary injection , diffuse fine keratic precipitates in the corneal endothelium , 3 + cellular reaction in the anterior chamber , 3 + cellular reaction in the vitreous without snowball or snowbank opacities , or vitreous hemorrhage . in fundoscopic examination , multiple foci of retinitis and retinal necrosis \n 2 ) associated with arteriolar involvement ( arteriolitis ) , blot retinal hemorrhage and optic disc hyperemia . \n pcr analysis of aqueous humor revealed hsv-2 , so the patient was admitted with the diagnosis of arn and received intravenous acyclovir for 10 days ( 10 mg / kg / day ) . \n after 48 h of antiviral therapy , a systemic corticosteroid ( prednisolone 1 mg / kg / day ) was introduced and subsequently tapered over several weeks to treat active inflammation . \n the patient also received aspirin to treat an associated hypercoagulable state . with this treatment , no new lesion developed and opacity of the media decreased ; so prophylactic barrier laser photocoagulation in the areas of healthy retina at the posterior borders of the necrotic lesion prevented retinal detachment . \n intravitreal antiviral agents such as ganciclovir and foscarnet were not used in this patient because the disease was controlled by intravenous acyclovir . \n after discharge from hospital , oral acyclovir 400 mg every 5 h was started . during follow - up , \n the inflammation decreased and the patient had no vitreous traction or retinal detachment or other eye involvement . \n the brain and retinal involvement were on one side ;

therefore , herpetic encephalitis may be a risk factor for arn development . \n other articles report that the virus accesses the retina from the brain by the trans - axonal route ; consequently , this virus can cause recurrent episodes of arn [ 8 , 9 ] . these reports may necessitate a prophylaxis with antiviral agents after herpetic encephalitis to prevent arn . in a study by pavsio et al . , the role of long - term prophylaxis with acyclovir in children who had herpetic encephalitis is an important issue . \n prophylaxis could be considered after hsv encephalitis to prevent arn or after arn to prevent second eye involvement . \n acyclovir used as prophylaxis for recurrent genital hsv infection in adults for 5 or more years has been associated with minimal toxicity and the selection of resistant strains has not been demonstrated , but there is little experience with the duration of prophylaxis that would have been necessary to prevent arn in our patient . with this report \n we reemphasize the correlation between these two diseases . on the other hand , arn may be an indication of possible central nervous system involvement and neuroimaging may be necessary in all cases of arn to rule out herpetic encephalitis .",

    "input": "inspection of the database of clusters of orthologous groups of proteins ( cogs )   revealed only one family of such proteins that is represented in most of the sequenced bacterial , archaeal and eukaryotic genomes . \n the prototype of this family is the rhomboid ( rho ) protein from drosophila melanogaster , a developmental regulator involved in epidermal growth factor ( egf)-dependent signaling pathways [ 2 - 4 ] . \n not only were homologs of rhomboid detected in prokaryotes and eukaryotes , but the pattern of sequence conservation in this family appeared uncharacteristic of nonenzymatic membrane proteins , such as transporters . \n specifically , several polar amino - acid residues are conserved in nearly all members of the rhomboid family , suggesting the possibility of an enzymatic activity . as three of these conserved residues were histidines , it has been hypothesized that rhomboid - family proteins could function as metal - dependent membrane proteases . \n recently , however , it has been shown that rho cleaves a transmembrane helix ( tmh ) in the membrane - bound precursor of the tgf-like growth factor spitz , enabling the released spitz to activate the egf receptor , and that a conserved serine and a conserved histidine in rho are essential for this cleavage . \n thus , it appears that rhomboid - family proteins are a distinct group of intramembrane serine proteases . \n altogether , the genome of drosophila encodes seven rho paralogs ( now designated rho1 - 7 , with the original rhomboid becoming rho-1 ) , at least three of which are involved in distinct egf - dependent pathways , apparently through proteolytic activation of diverse ligands of the egf receptor . \n the newly discovered intramembrane proteolytic activity of rho places the rhomboid family within the framework of regulated intramembrane proteolysis ( rip ) , a new paradigm of signal transduction , which appears to be prominent in all forms of life . under rip , signaling proteins undergo site - specific proteolysis within tmh , resulting in the release of active fragments , which are the actual effectors in signal tranduction cascades . until recently \n , the only characterized cases of rip in eukaryotes involved presenilin-1 , an aspartyl protease , which cleaves a transmembrane helix in type-1 membrane proteins such as amyloid -precursor protein ( app ) , notch and ire1 , and the metalloprotease s2p , which cleaves a tmh in a type-2 transmembrane protein , the sterol - dependent transcription factor srebp . \n notably , s2p has highly conserved bacterial homologs , and the protease domain of presenilins also might be homologous to bacterial and archaeal type iv prepilin peptidases , although , in this case , the sequence similarity is low . in the case of the rhomboid family , \n the existence of homologs of rho in most prokaryotes is particularly remarkable because animal rho proteins are involved in signaling pathways that are not found outside metazoa , which seems to make functional conservation in prokaryotes a remote possibility . \n the only prokaryotic protein of the rhomboid family that has been characterized experimentally in considerable detail is aara from the bacterium providencia stuartii . \n this protein is involved in the export of a quorum - sensing peptide , a function that , in physiological terms , resembles that of rho , although the signaling molecules , other than rho and aara , are obviously unrelated . in a striking recent development \n , two independent research groups have shown that several bacterial rhomboid - family proteins , including aara , can cleave the egf receptor ligands ( spitz , keren and gurken ) that are normally cleaved by rho paralogs . \n the cleavage depended on the conserved serine and histidine residues   and , moreover , transgenic flies that expressed aara developed a phenotype indistinguishable from that induced by overexpression of rho , whereas rho could substitute for aara in providencia stuartii . \n these unexpected findings demonstrated the conservation of a rip mechanism producing extracellular signals in eukaryotes and prokaryotes . \n eukaryotic rhomboid family proteins seem to show considerable functional variability ; in particular , cross - talk might exist between different rip pathways . a distinct representative of the rhomboid family has been shown to physically interact with presinilins 1 and 2 , and was accordingly named presenilins - associated rhomboid - like protein ( parl ) . \n the yeast ortholog of parl has been suggested to participate in the processing of cytochrome c peroxidase precursor during its import into the mitochondrion . \n the near ubiquity of the rhomboid family among bacteria , archaea and eukaryotes , along with the remarkable functional conservation , suggests that a signaling mechanism mediated by rhomboids might have functioned already in the last common ancestor of all extant life forms , with subsequent loss in several lineages . to address this possibility \n although the sequence similarity between eukaryotic and prokaryotic rhomboid family proteins is relatively low ( around 10 - 15% identity in the conserved region ) , the entire superfamily could be retrieved from the protein sequence databases within three iterations of the psi - blast program with a high statistical significance and without any false positives . \n the conserved core of the rhomboid family consists of six conserved tmhs ( figure 1 ) . \n the predicted catalytic serine is located in tmh5 , whereas the predicted catalytic histidine is in tmh7 ; tmh3 contains two additional histidines and an asparagine , which are conserved in the great majority of the rhomboid - family proteins ( figure 1 ) . \n the roles of these conserved residues are not known , but , given the remarkable evolutionary conservation , it seems likely that they also contribute to catalysis ; indeed , it has been shown that the conserved asparagine is required for the cleavage of spitz by rho . \n when examining the multiple alignment of the rhomboid superfamily proteins , we noticed that several eukaryotic members appear to be inactivated proteases , as indicated by the loss of the predicted catalytic serine or histidine ( figure 1 , and data not shown ) ; these inactivated forms could be regulators of active rhomboid proteases . \n several other proteins lack one or more of the conserved residues in tmh3 ; it remains unclear whether or not these are active proteases . bacterial and archaeal members of the rhomboid superfamily contain six tmh , whereas the eukaryotic members typically have an additional seventh tmh , which may be attached to the core either from the amino terminus or from the carboxyl terminus as discussed below . \n the phyletic distribution pattern of the rhomboid family shows that this intramembrane protease is extremely common in all three kingdoms of life , but is not necessarily essential for cell function . \n rhomboids are missing in the microsporidian encephalitozoon cuniculi , a eukaryotic intracellular parasite with a highly degraded genome , the archaea methanothermobacter thermoautotrophicus and thermoplasma volcanium , and several bacterial species , primarily parasites with small genomes but also species with moderately sized genomes , such as xylella fastidiosum ( see cog0705 at ) . in two instances , \n a representative of the rhomboid family is present in only one of a pair of relatively close genomes ( present in t. acidophilum but missing in t. volcanium ; present in the spirochete treponema pallidum but missing in the related bacterium borrelia burgdorferi ) , which suggests relatively recent , repeated losses of this gene . \n most of the prokaryotic species have a single gene coding for a rhomboid - family protein , although some have two or three paralogs ( see cog0705 ) ; in contrast , eukaryotes show expansion of the rhomboid family , with seven members in drosophila , and as many as 13 in arabidopsis . \n the multiple alignment of the 6-tmh core of the rhomboid family ( figure 1 ) was employed to construct a phylogenetic tree using the least - squares algorithm with subsequent optimization using the maximum likelihood ( ml ) method ( see materials and methods ) . only the conserved regions including the tmh and \n short adjacent stretches shown in figure 1 were used as the input for tree building , whereas the poorly conserved intervening regions were omitted to avoid noise from potentially misaligned residues ( except for the bayesian analysis , which used the complete alignment ; see materials and methods ) . \n the phylogenetic tree of the rhomboid family presents a complex and unexpected picture ( figure 2 ) . \n neither the eukaryotic nor the archaeal subsets of the family appear to form monophyletic clades . \n instead , the eukaryotic rhomboids are split between two major subfamilies , which are positioned in the midst of different prokaryotic branches ( figure 2 ) . \n the first subfamily , whic...",

    "input": "an infliction in the life expectancy figure of patients with sickle cell disease ( scd ) occurred around the middle of the 1970s ( fig . \n this minimal increase in life expectancy coincided with my appointment at thomas jefferson university as the associate director of the newly created adult sickle cell center . \n the number of adults at that time was small and the transition from pediatrics to adult programs was at the age of 18 years . \n the trickle of patients increased gradually and we were faced with adolescent and young adult african american patients who were in a state of confusion . \n stripped from the protective sphere of the pediatric world and the empathy of their pediatric hematologists and the pediatric ancillary staff , they were in a state of fear , anxiety , depression and , worst of all , severe pain . \n the fact that most patients were barely educated , many without a high school degree , unemployed , mediocre health coverage , and dysfunctional family structure conferred a logarithmic dimension to the problem . \n the arrow indicates the infliction point where life expectancy of patients with sickle cell disease began to increase . \n the steady stream of admissions of patients with acute painful vaso - occlusive crises ( vocs ) to the emergency department ( ed ) and hospital were not welcome by most providers , hospital administration , the house and nursing staffs . \n there was subtle resentment of the patients that sometimes extended to the hematologists who showed compassion to the patients . soon labels such as drug addicts , drug - seeking behavior , and hospital hopping and frequent flyer emerged . \n listening to and believing the patients and keeping detailed records of ed and hospital admissions and the analgesics prescribed , revealed that most patients genuinely do not respond to a certain analgesic or a certain dose . increasing the doses of an analgesic or switching to another drug solved the problem in most patients . \n accordingly and with the approval of the institutional review board ( irb ) , i issued an identification wallet - sized , plasticized card that was carried by patients and presented to the provider treating their voc in the ed , hospital or any other medical facility . \n information printed on both sides of the card included : 1 ) demographic data and a recent photograph ; 2 ) hematological data including reticulocyte count ; 3 ) medical data including the type of scd , its complications and co - morbidities if present ; 4 ) all medications being taken by the patient and the recommended treatment of vocs including the name , dose , and the route of administration of the analgesics in question ; and 5 ) my name and contact information for answering questions if needed . \n it was not expensive to issue these cards . a polaroid camera available at that time and a laminator were the only equipments needed to issue these cards . \n later on , information on the card was computerized and a printed copy was given to the patient . \n the patients were very compliant in carrying it as faithfully as they carry their medical cards . \n some providers liked it very much because it facilitated having a concise history about the patients . \n while this controversy was brewing , interesting developments in basic science were in progress to understand the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids . \n in the 1970s , it was hypothesized that opioids have receptors to bind to and activate in order to relieve pain   by blocking or minimizing the transmission of painful stimuli and raising the pain threshold . \n it did not take long after that to identify opioids as ligands that bind to stereospecific and saturable receptors in the central nervous system and other tissues [ 3 , 4 ] . \n in addition , recent elegant studies [ 6 - 10 ] have revealed a helical structure of the opioid receptors , which forms pockets in which the corresponding opioid ( ligand ) fits snugly ( fig . \n recognition is highly specific , such that only l - isomers of certain opioids exert analgesic activity . \n physiologically , by binding to receptors , opioids initiate a series of biochemical events including activation of g proteins , inhibition of adenylate cyclase , and extrusion of potassium ions , resulting in hyperpolarization of cell membranes [ 14 - 16 ] ; this delays or prevents transmission of painful stimuli . \n thus , the riddle why some patients respond to one opioid but not another had a pathophysiologic explanation . \n ( a ) morphine - like molecule ( yellow ) in the deep pocket ( blue ) of the -opioid receptor . ( b ) \n -opioid receptors from an intimate pair when crystallized with a ligand ( yellow ) such as morphine . knowing how an opioid molecule ( yellow ) sticks in the pocket of its receptor ( blue ) \n parallel to the progress in the pharmacodynamics of opioids mentioned above , a concomitant advance in the pharmacokinetics of opioids was bubbling to the surface . \n phase i involves the cyp enzymes and phase ii metabolism conjugates the drug to hydrophilic substances , such as glucuronic acid , sulfate , glycine , or glutathione . \n morphine , hydromorphone and oxymorphone are metabolized by glucuronidation , whereas the majority of the other opioids are metabolized by the cytochrome p450 isoenzyme system . \n the net effect of an opioid depends on the availability of enzyme(s ) to convert it into metabolites that could be active or inactive . \n briefly , the cyp2d6 genotypes are categorized into phenotypes based on the activity of the variant enzymes . \n ultrarapid metabolizers ( ums ) have greater than normal activity due to duplication or triplication , of active alleles [ 20 - 23 ] , extensive metabolizers ( ems ) have normal enzyme activity , intermediate metabolizers ( ims ) have decreased enzyme activity , and poor metabolizers ( pms ) have absent or little enzyme activity . \n patients who are ums of fentanyl would rapidly convert it into inactive metabolites with minimal or absent analgesic effect requiring increasing the dose of fentanyl . \n on the other hand , patients who are pms of fentanyl would experience prompt relief with relatively small doses of fentanyl but higher doses could be toxic due to the accumulation of unmetabolized fentanyl . \n the cyp3a4 enzyme metabolizes more than 50% of all drugs ; consequently , opioids metabolized by this enzyme have a high risk of drug - drug interactions . \n together , current data on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of opioids show great variability of genotypes among patients and extreme variability in individual responses to opioids . determining the pharmacogenetics profile of each patient \n facilitates the choice of drugs that would be efficacious for that patient and avoid those drugs associated with harmful drug - drug interaction . \n this approach in diagnostics and therapeutics ushers in the dawn of a new field for the management of individual patients based on their unique pharmacogenetics , phenotypic and biomarker characteristics . \n this future approach is referred to as personalized medicine or , more recently , precision medicine . \n we hope that this methodology would be approved and sponsored by the insurance companies for patients with scd . in the meantime , listening , believing and respecting the patient with sickle cell pain should be maintained for now as the approach to individualized therapy . \n ",

    "input": "the potential of rnai to silence any gene has made it an attractive therapeutic modality . \n however , the main obstacle to rnai in the clinic is delivery . to be effective \n , sirnas must be transported through the body , bind , and be taken up by target cells where they must traverse the plasma membrane and gain access to the cytosolic compartment , where the rnai machinery resides . to be useful , \n ease of formulation and administration , overall cost , and any associated toxicities are essential considerations . \n dcs are heterogeneous , with subsets defined phenotypically , functionally and by location ( reviewed in ref . \n 2 ) . a delivery vehicle that knocks down expression of specific genes in a distinct dc population(s ) would be a valuable tool for targeting diverse diseases including cancers , infectious diseases , autoimmunity and as a vaccine component . \n therefore , a platform that delivers sirnas to specific dc subsets in situ would be useful for inhibiting or activating immune responses . \n lipid nanoparticles ( lnps ) are one of the most advanced platforms for sirna delivery to hepatocytes , and are under clinical evaluation for conditions that require hepatic gene silencing . \n these lnps typically contain ionizable cationic lipids ( pka ~6.5 ) that bind nucleic acids via electrostatic interactions at low ph , but are charge neutral at ph 7.4 . as a well - perfused organ \n furthermore , lnp uptake by hepatocytes is mediated by association with serum apoe leading to efficient uptake via low - density lipoprotein receptors in the liver . \n following cellular uptake of the lnp , the ionization of the lipid within acidic endosomes is thought to promote sirna escape to the cytosol . \n importantly , these lnps are associated with minimal toxicity , including little induction of proinflammatory cytokines following administration of physiologically relevant doses . \n in contrast to the liver , sirna delivery to extra - hepatic cells is challenging . in particular , immune cells such as dcs are relatively resistant to sirna uptake in vitro and in vivo . \n although designed for hepatic gene silencing , the efficacy of these lnps and their derivatives has been assessed for rnai - mediated gene silencing in macrophages ( mos ) and dcs in vitro and in vivo . \n lnp uptake and modest gene silencing was achieved at high doses of lnps ( ~ 5mg / kg ) . \n together with a complementary study , this work demonstrates the feasibility of gene silencing in immune cells using lnp technology . clearly \n , however , lnp formulations must be modified to achieve optimal gene silencing in immune cells . \n enhanced uptake of lnps by primary hepatocytes is mediated by apolipoprotein e binding to the neutral lnps . \n this results in recognition by receptors including the low - density lipoprotein receptor and scavenger receptors largely expressed on hepatocytes . \n the mechanism of uptake strongly suggests that retargeting of these particles to other receptors or other tissues is possible . \n indeed , akinc et al . demonstrated that lnps modified with n - acetylgalactosamine ( galnac ) were retargeted to the asialoglycoprotein receptor ( asgpr ) expressed by hepatocytes in vivo . \n for delivery to nonhepatic cells , we have shown in vitro that anti - transferrin receptor aptamers can be used to redirect similar lnps . \n more recently , liang et al . described a similar approach using aptamer - coated lnps to target osteoblasts in vivo . \n for uptake by immune cells , a recent study coated lnps with a full - length anti - cd4 antibody for sirna delivery to primary cd4 t cells . \n lnp uptake and gene silencing was observed in cd4 t cells in various organs including the spleen , lymph nodes , and blood . \n these studies demonstrate the potential for attaching exogenous ligands to lnps for delivery to hepatic , and importantly nonhepatic primary cells in vivo . drawing from these works \n , we reasoned that this lnp platform could be a useful foundation for the delivery of sirnas to dcs to modulate immune responses . to achieve this \n , we modified lnps using a single chain antibody ( scfv ) specific for the dc receptor dec205 , a c - type lectin expressed at high levels on cd8 dcs . \n dec205 dcs mediate cross - presentation of antigen resulting in modulation of cd8 t - cell responses . therefore , inhibition of gene expression by dec205 dcs is a potentially powerful approach for regulating cd8 t - cell activation . using this approach , we assessed the ability of dec - lnps ( lnps coated with scfv specific for murine dec205 , containing sirnas specific for costimulatory molecules ) to inhibit immune responses . \n injection of dec - lnps resulted in preferential uptake of the dec - lnps by splenic dec205 dcs . \n furthermore , when coadministered with adjuvant , lnps containing sirna targeting cd40 , cd80 , and cd86 reduced expression of these costimulatory molecules to levels similar to those observed in immature dcs . \n most importantly , dcs isolated from mice injected with a low dose ( ~0.6  mg / kg ) of these dec - lnps , were able to suppress a robust mixed lymphocyte reaction ( mlr ) , demonstrating the functional efficacy of this approach . \n interestingly , when we performed experiments using 2 ' fluoro ( 2'f ) modified sirna , a formulation reported to be nonimmunostimulatory and nonimmunogenic , significant immune activation of the targeted dcs was detected . this effect was not observed in assays performed with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( pbmcs ) or monocyte - derived dcs ( modcs ) and could be mitigated through selective 2-o - methyl ( 2ome ) modification of the sirna . \n overall , our study demonstrates the functionality of lnps modified for receptor targeting for sirna delivery to dcs . \n additionally our results suggest that specific cell targeting can mediate immunological responses to sirna formulations . \n while care needs to be taken in designing and evaluating targeted approaches using lnps , we found that 2ome modification of the sirna was sufficient to negate immune activation . \n our approach enhances the efficacy of sirna - mediated gene silencing by ~10-fold when compared to nontargeted delivery . \n therefore , this targeted strategy should prove effective for regulating multiple immune - mediated diseases . \n lnps containing sirnas specific either for cd80 , cd86 , cd40 , or a control ( nontarget ) sequence were synthesized by extrusion using a mixture of 1,2-distearoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ( dspc):dlindma : dspe - peg : cholesterol at a ratio of 15:40:5:40 ( based on refs . \n murine anti - dec205 scfv with a c - terminal cysteine was attached to the lipid dspe - peg by a maleimide group ( figure 1a , b ) . following synthesis , we subjected lnps to quality control to ensure consistency between batches . \n dynamic light scattering was used to determine diameter and polydispersity of lnps , and cryo - electron microscopy confirmed lnp size and their unilamellar structure ( figure 1c , d ) . \n the efficiency of sirna incorporation and scfv binding to dspe - peg was also assessed ( figure 1c , e ) . to show specificity of binding to dec205 , \n scfv - lnps containing dy547-labeled sirna were cultured with either parental ( dec205 ) or dec205 cho cells . as seen in figure 2a , at 4 c dec205 cells bind dec - lnps approximately fourfold better compared with nontargeted lnps ( nt - lnps : lnps not coated with any scfv ) , or lnps coated with an isotype scfv ( iso - lnps ; cho - dec205 panel ) . when similar assays were performed at 37 c to allow cell uptake , cell staining increased by at least fivefold . \n little uptake was observed when lnps ( targeted or nontargeted ) were incubated with parental cho cells ( cho panel ) . \n similar results were obtained when bone marrow - derived dcs ( bmdcs ) , derived from wild - type mice ( b6 ) were incubated with dec - lnps . \n we note that as dec205 is expressed at lower levels on bmdcs compared with cho - dec205 , less dec - lnp binding and uptake was observed in bmdcs ( ~2-fold enhancement compared with nt- or iso - lnps ; b6 bmdc panel ) . to further confirm target - specific uptake we performed experiments using bmdcs derived from dec205 mice , and no specific cell binding or uptake \n the dec205 antibody is internalized via receptor - mediated endocytosis , and is targeted to late endosomes and lysosomes . \n confocal microscopy confirmed that similar to dec205 antibody , dec - lnps were targeted to lamp-1 late endosomes or lysosomes ( figure 2b ) . \n having demonstrated dec205-mediated uptake of dec - lnps in vitro , we investigated their localization in vivo . \n b6 mice were injected systemically ( intravenous , i.v . ) with fluorescently labeled scfv - lnps . \n as the dec205 receptor is endocytosed when it binds its ligand , we could not use this molecule to identify dec205 dcs . \n therefore , we used cd8 , a protein that is coexpressed on dec205 dcs , as...",

    "input": "according to the mca , only a compromised ability to make a decision in accordance with certain procedural norms , loosely defined with reference to the ability to  understand , \n retain and  use or weigh relevant information , or an inability to communicate a decision , properly grounds judgments of incapacity ( s. 3(1 ) ) . \n in addition , the identified problems of decision - making must be attributed to  an impairment of , or disturbance in the functioning of , mind or brain ( s. 2(1 ) ) . \n this law aims to protect the individual 's right to pursue their own ends by adopting a capacity test that focuses on the decision - making process rather than the substance of the patient 's decision . \n influential liberal thinking holds that it is not the place of the law to pursue certain ends  rather , the law should aim to provide a space for individuals to pursue their own ends ( plant , 2011 )  and this position is reflected in english common law relating to mental capacity:[in assessments of capacity ] it is most important that those considering the issue should not confuse the question of mental capacity with the nature of the decision made by the patient , however grave the consequences . \n the view of the patient may reflect a difference in values rather than an absence of competence and the assessment of capacity should be approached with this firmly in mind.whether the patient 's decision is consistent with proposed substantive norms in relation to what they should pursue  for example that people should pursue good health , or that they should want to live  is said to be beyond the proper scope of the incapacity test . in adopting this position \n , english law allows that even the most controversial treatment decisions might be explained by the fact that the patient 's evaluation of the situation diverges from a clinical perspective , and perhaps many people 's evaluation of the situation . \n [ in assessments of capacity ] it is most important that those considering the issue should not confuse the question of mental capacity with the nature of the decision made by the patient , however grave the consequences . \n the view of the patient may reflect a difference in values rather than an absence of competence and the assessment of capacity should be approached with this firmly in mind. in practice then , questions of mental capacity might be thought of as boiling down to a question about whether a decision can be explained in terms of the patient 's particular motivating commitments ( their desires , values , projects , ideas about a good life ) ; or whether the decision is properly explained in terms of a problem in decision - making , which is due to a dysfunction of mind or brain . is the patient 's controversial decision understandable in the light of their commitments ? or is the patient 's ability to understand , retain , and use or weigh what the likely costs and benefits of treatment will be for them , currently compromised ? scrutinizing a patient 's commitments in the context of a capacity assessment raises moral concerns because the possibility that a choice can be explained by idiosyncratic commitments plays a significant role in protecting the patient 's right to make controversial decisions . \n perhaps the most straightforward approach to conceiving of commitments , and the one most likely to protect this right , is to say that the person 's commitments are their current commitments  those they recognize at the time of the decision . \n the problem with conceiving of commitments in this way is that it fails to recognise certain problems of practical decision - making to do with motivational coherence over time . \n someone with bipolar disorder , for example , might clearly be choosing or acting in accordance with their current desires during a manic phase , but this perspective fails to capture what seemingly goes wrong with practical decision - making in such cases . as a result , if this understanding of commitments is adopted in assessments of mental capacity the reach of this area of law arguably does not extend as far as it should  a person may be judged to have mental capacity where this seems doubtful . \n psychopathologies characterised by this kind of problem seem better accounted for in a legal structure that conceives of mental capacity , and in particular , commitments , in diachronic terms . \n a diachronic perspective might also help illuminate some other hard cases that are not normally characterised in terms of problems of motivational coherence over time . \n for example , someone with anorexia nervosa may be choosing rationally in accordance with their current commitments  especially a strong desire not to gain weight , or to exert extreme control over what they eat  and so may be judged to have capacity on these grounds . however , an assessment of their evaluative capacities in diachronic terms might yield the conclusion that their decision - making ability is seriously compromised ( craigie , 2011 ) . \n their future self may come to the view that they should have been motivated in ways that they could not recognise or could not act on at the time , and this might be a fairly robust feature of people with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa . \n this perspective in relation to questions of mental capacity chimes with the suggestion that particularly in psychiatry ,  colloquialisms [ such as ]  you will thank me later  sometimes become the unwritten rules within which the merits of a patient 's consent are assessed ( gostin , 1981 , p. 742 ) . \n such a perspective may also offer a solution in cases where the patient does not have a psychiatric diagnosis . \n mackenzie and watts discuss a case of a woman who was judged to have the capacity to refuse life - saving treatment , and subsequently died , in a situation where she had recently been left by her husband , following the amputation of both her legs . \n they argue that the trauma of these events and her subsequent inability to imagine a life without her partner clouded the woman 's judgment in relation to treatment:the tragedy is that in this case therapy or treatment might have corrected her assumptions regarding future quality of life , and a decision to accept the lifesaving treatment might have resulted. ( 2011 , p. 33 \n ; for a full description of the case , see halpern , 2012)differences between these cases suggest that taking a diachronic perspective in assessments of mental capacity allows for decision - making to be compromised in at least two ways . in the bipolar disorder and anorexia nervosa cases a diachronic perspective is used to argue that a person 's evaluative capacities may be compromised  the capacities that determine the desires or values that motivate a decision . in the emotional trauma case , which might equally be applied to cases of depression , a diachronic perspective is used to identify a problem in the person 's ability to assess whether what they want or value is achievable . according to jodi halpern 's original analysis of the emotional trauma case , the woman should have been judged to lack capacity on grounds that her beliefs about the future were  unresponsive to evidence , rendering her unable to  think through alternatives ( halpern , 2012 , pp . \n the tragedy is that in this case therapy or treatment might have corrected her assumptions regarding future quality of life , and a decision to accept the lifesaving treatment might have resulted. ( 2011 , p. 33 \n ; for a full description of the case , see halpern , 2012 ) one problem with adopting a diachronic perspective in assessments of mental capacity is that whether questions of procedural rationality are properly understood in diachronic terms remains a contested issue in the fields of economics , psychology and philosophy . \n the functional element of the mca 's incapacity test concerns problems in meeting certain procedural requirements  problems in the ability to understand , retain , use or weigh relevant information . \n sceptics deny that at least some norms derived from a diachronic perspective fall into this category . \n they hold that such requirements are substantive rather than procedural in nature , so i turn now to this theoretical concern . \n much of the normative and descriptive work on a diachronic perspective in personal decision - making has taken place in the fields of economics and psychology , but these fields have tended to adopt contrasting positions on the normative question . \n economists often treat a person 's weighting of the future as a preference like any other , in a framework that assumes that preferences are not available to rational criticism . \n prudence to refer to taking a diachronic perspective in decision - making:prudence can not on this view be explained merely by the perception that something is in one 's future interest ; there must be a desire to further one 's future interests if the perception is to have an effect \n t...",
    "reference": "calls for the adoption of a universal capacity approach to replace dedicated mental health law are motivated by the idea that the measures designed to protect patient autonomy in legislation such as the mental capacity act 2005 should apply to everyone , including people with a psychiatric diagnosis . in this article \n it is argued that a diachronic perspective on questions of mental capacity is necessary if capacity law is to play this broader role , but that employing this perspective in assessments of capacity undermines central patient autonomy preserving features of the legislation , which presents a moral dilemma ."

    "input": "type iii dysbetalipoproteinaemia is a kind of lipid metabolism disorders , caused by apo - e deficiency , which leads to accumulation of chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein remnants in the plasma.123 lipid metabolism disorders are mostly manifested by xanthomas , which are known as yellowish cholesterol - rich material in large foam cells accumulating in the skins and tendons.14 these yellowish lesions may appear all over the body , on the palm of the hands , sole of the foot , tendons , and even on the eyelids.5 these lesions firstly described with or without hyperlipidaemia in association with monoclonal immunoglobulin . based on this fact , there are three forms of xanthoma : hyperlipaemic xanthoma , normolipaemic xanthoma and necrobiotic xanthogranuloma.6 xanthomatosis is usually associated with hyperlipidaemia , and morbidity and mortality of this condition are related to atherosclerosis and pancreatitis.7 hyperlipaemic xanthoma lesions are more polymorphic and can include tuberous , tendinous , palmar or eruptive xanthoma . \n verruciform xanthoma usually presents as a hyperkeratotic , cauliflower like , verrucous or papillomatous lesion.6 it initially was described as a unique clinicopathologic lesion of the oral mucosa and was subsequently reported in the skin . \n the epidermal - mucosal changes of hyperparakeratosis , neutrophilic infiltrate and dermal - submucosal foam cell reaction are distinctive features of these xanthomas.8 hereby , we present a rare type of xanthomas calling  cauliflower xanthoma  in a 43-year - old man with dysbetalipoproteinaemia . \n a 43-year - old man was presented to outpatient endocrine clinic of tabriz university of medical sciences , tabriz , iran , by his sister for evaluation of skin lesions . \n he had multiple lesions on shoulders and back , lateral and medial part of dorsal surface of the foot , medial and lateral malleus of both feet , and dorsal and palmar surface of both hands . \n siblings of the patient have been followed up in that clinic for clinically diagnosed type - iii dysbetalipoproteinaemia . \n this diagnosis was based on characteristic palmar , eruptive , tuberous and trauma site xanthomas with typical high levels of both total cholesterol and triglycerides in the plasma . \n history of coronary artery or other atherosclerotic disorders were negative in index case and siblings . \n there were not any other complaint , and as a greengrocer , he had an active lifestyle . \n he had a pathology report of skin lesion biopsy that was performed by a dermatologist few months ago , with presence of lipid laden macrophages consistent with diagnosis of xanthoma . fasting serum lipid levels reported as : total cholesterol = 507 mg / dl , triglycerides = 470 mg / dl and high density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol = 41 mg / dl . \n he had normal fasting blood sugar , and normal thyroid , renal and liver function tests . \n physical examinations revealed numerous xanthomas resembling cauliflower on both knees [ figure 1 ] , unusual eruptive , tuberous xanthomas same as previous lesions , on the lateral malleus of both feet [ figure 2 ] . \n cauliflower xanthomas on the knees and lateral malleus of both lower extremities cauliflower xanthomas on the lateral malleus of lower extremities there were lots of smaller xanthomas on the right shoulder [ figure 3 ] , and cauliflower like xanthomas on the extensor side of the left upper extremity , especially on the elbow [ figure 4 ] . based on available information \n , the patient diagnosed as familial dysbetalipoproteinaemia ( fdl ) and the unique lesions on the lower limb called  cauliflower xanthoma  . \n although siblings of this case had the same disorder , they did nt develop such lesions . \n xanthomas on the shoulder and back of the neck xanthomas on the extensor side of the hand by searching in the medical data bases , we can not find a previous such a lesion . therefore , we decided to present this case without revealing patient 's name , after taking his consent . \n considering the fact that the treatment with high dose statin was effective in correction of lipid abnormality and regression of skin lesions in his three siblings , we wanted to try the treatment procedure in this patient but he refused any intervention . \n fdl , also known as hyperlipoproteinemia type - iii or broad beta disease , is a rare inherited disorder characterised by improper metabolism of certain lipids , specially plasma cholesterol , triglyceride rich chylomicron and very low density lipoproteins ( vldl ) remnants.1 presence or absence of the symptoms of this disease depends on two major risk factors : genetic and diet.910 mutations in the gene for apolipoprotein e ( apo e ) are the main cause of this disease . \n replacement of an arginine by a cysteine in position 158 of the 299-amino acid chain of apo e5 is responsible for the defective binding of chylomicron and vldl remnants to cell receptors . \n thereafter , slower plasma clearance of these particles occurs , and results in the abnormal accumulation of lipids in the body.9 on the other side , diet has an essential role in the development of the disease . \n this means that with standard cholesterol diet , symptoms of fdl will not appear , even in the genetically susceptible person.10 xanthomas can be a symptom of fdl . \n xanthomas may also be the symptoms of a generalised histiocytosis , or a local fat phagocytosing storage process.11 they are yellowish lesions on the skins and tendons , macroscopically . \n these macrophages are filled with lipid droplets , which are dissolved and removed from tissue during histologic processing.8 fdl is mostly diagnosed by combination of clinical and laboratory findings.12 most cases are inherited as autosomal recessive trait . \n men are more susceptible for fdl probably because of protective impact of estrogen in women . \n most of the diagnosed patients were typically young males , with strong family history , characteristic skin lesions , high serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and confirming skin histology.113 most of these cases have premature atherosclerosis and other signs of ischaemic disorders.9 the patient in this article was a middle aged man with family history of dysbetalipoproteinaemia and high levels of serum lipids as follows : total cholesterol = 507 mg / dl and triglycerides = 470 mg / dl . \n he had a rare form of xanthoma all over his body , causing social problems for him . \n nicotinic acid , clofibrate , statins or gemfibrozil properly reduce cholesterol and triglycerides in people affected with dysbetalipoproteinaemia.1 the patient mentioned in this article refused receiving any medical intervention . \n he has just been advised to have low lipid diet , fish oil and regular moderate exercise in order to reducing serum lipid levels . \n there should be distinctive monitoring of fdl patients including regular checking of their serum lipids . \n controlling underlying disorders , and reducing excess calories , saturated fat and cholesterol , is the main aim of treating these patients . according to this article \n , cauliflower xanthomas could be a symptom of fdl , and it should be considered as a differential diagnosis while approaching to these lesions .",

    "input": "it is not uncommon to see bleeding symptoms in patients in outpatient or hospital - based practice . \n postpartum hemorrhage complicates pregnancy and accounts for significant morbidity and mortality , particularly in underdeveloped countries.1,2 menorrhagia is a common clinical challenge and is often associated with secondary anemia , excessive fatigue , and a negative effect on health - related quality of life.3 postoperative bleeding is one of the more common complications of surgery . \n trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the younger population.4 while bleeding symptoms may be commonly seen by physicians of multiple specialties , it is unclear how frequently these symptoms belie an underlying undiagnosed congenital or acquired bleeding disorder . in the us , \n the most common congenital bleeding disorders include von willebrand disease , which affects approximately 1% of the population ( males and females equally),5 and hemophilia a and b combined , which affect approximately 20,000 persons ( essentially all males , with rare exception).6 medications can also affect coagulation or platelet function,7 as can certain herbal supplements.8 trauma and surgery can lead to blood loss , and critical reduction in coagulation factors can lead to additional non - surgical bleeding complications ( coagulopathic bleeding).9 the most ubiquitous method for evaluating coagulation is prothrombin time ( pt)/international normalized ratio ( inr ) and activated partial thromboplastin time ( aptt ) . \n typically , they are ordered to monitor anticoagulant therapy ( pt / inr for warfarin , aptt for heparin ) , to evaluate coagulation preoperatively , or in response to hemorrhagic symptoms . \n the pt / inr provides an assessment of the extrinsic ( tissue factor - dependent ) and final common pathways of the coagulation cascade , while the aptt provides an assessment of the intrinsic ( tissue factor - independent ) and final common pathways.10 an example of a potentially life - threatening cause of unexplained recent onset or acute bleeding associated with a prolonged aptt is acquired hemophilia , with an incidence of approximately 1 to 4 per million / year.11 acquired hemophilia primarily affects older adults,12 an ever - growing segment of the population that presents for medical evaluation and care , but may also occur during pregnancy as postpartum hemorrhage or in association with other underlying diseases , including cancer and autoimmune disorders.13 prompt diagnosis is a primary determinant of prognosis in acquired hemophilia14 because initiation of definitive therapy ( ie , hemostatic and immunosuppressive ) is delayed until the diagnosis is made . \n acquired hemophilia - related bleeding does not respond to the typical management algorithms used for hemorrhaging in a patient and , therefore , is associated with high morbidity and mortality . \n severe bleeds occur in up to 90% of patients with acquired hemophilia,11 and the reported overall mortality rate in these patients ranges from 8% to 22%.1517 given the rarity of acquired hemophilia , combined with the general lack of familiarity of nonhematologists with this condition , the diagnosis of acquired hemophilia poses a clinical challenge , even in patients presenting with straightforward bleeding and an isolated , prolonged aptt . \n a survey was conducted of physicians across a number of specialties to identify potential barriers to the effective recognition and management of this rare but important cause of serious bleeding . \n the survey , based on an actual case found to be the result of acquired hemophilia , focused on participants stepwise evaluation and management of a case patient who presented to the hospital with recent - onset bleeding . \n the survey also assessed participants history with regard to consulting hematologists , discovering or diagnosing underlying bleeding disorders , and encountering acquired hemophilia in clinical practice . \n findings pertaining to the interpretation and follow - up of abnormal coagulation studies , enlistment of hematology consultation , and the diagnostic decision process in an actively bleeding case patient were the primary areas assessed in this analysis . \n results were evaluated across specialties to determine any specialty - specific practice trends that might hinder effective recognition and management of an actively bleeding patient with coagulopathy , including acquired hemophilia . \n physicians within the specialties of hematology , hematology / oncology , emergency medicine , geriatrics , internal medicine , rheumatology , obstetrics and gynecology , critical care medicine , and general surgery were randomly sampled from the american medical association physician masterfile . \n physicians who were part of the harris interactive online physician panel were invited via email to participate in the survey , while physicians who were not part of the panel were invited via first class mail . \n the invitation provided a uniform resource locator address and password for one - time use to log on to the survey site , where invitees first encountered questions to determine eligibility to participate in the survey . \n eligible physicians were required to be actively practicing , with additional specialty - specific requirements . \n in particular , hematologists , hematologist / oncologists , general surgeons , and emergency medicine and critical care physicians were required to be practicing at an acute care hospital . for internists and geriatricians , \n at least 60% of their practice had to consist of patients older than 60 years of age . \n obstetricians / gynecologists were required to have an active obstetrics practice . upon confirmation of eligibility , participants completed the online survey , the average duration of which was approximately 10 minutes . \n each specialty was recruited to a final sample of 50 complete responses to ensure a sufficient number of responses to generate reasonable hypotheses about specialists behavior to test in face - to - face interviews . \n findings from the surveys completed by the physicians specializing in hematology , hematology / oncology , emergency medicine , geriatrics , internal medicine , rheumatology , and critical care medicine are presented herein . \n general surgeons and obstetrics and gynecology physicians each completed different surveys from the aforementioned specialties ; the findings of those surveys are not included here . \n survey questions focused on the diagnostic and general therapeutic approach to the management of a case patient ( figure 1 ) whose presentation and clinical course were based on those of a real patient who experienced significant delays in diagnosis despite the involvement of multiple specialists . at each juncture in the case , participants were given lists of actions that included diagnostic tests ( laboratory , radiology , other ) , consultations , and potential treatments addressing bleeding or anemia ( local hemostasis , transfusion ) . since familiarity with the upper limits of normal of the pt / aptt tests was being tested in this study , upper limits of normal were not specified , and aptts were 25% to 30% above the upper limits of normal and set at a value that respective specialties would recognize as abnormal based on their experience with ordering and interpreting this laboratory test . \n the survey did not specify whether laboratory testing , imaging studies , or consultations in this hypothetical case had to be available immediately or locally , and the assumption was that respondents would answer based on their best medical judgment in an ideal practice situation . \n rheumatologists were only asked about an initial emergency department / urgent care presentation because it was expected that if a bleeding disorder developed in one of their patients it would present in an outpatient or emergency department / urgent care setting . \n conversely , critical care specialists started at presentation 2 , since their involvement in a recurrent epistaxis workup would be unlikely . \n vital signs were adjusted to make it more likely that a potential intensive care unit admission would require their evaluation . since emergency medicine physicians would most likely have ordered an imaging study initially to define the patient s retroperitoneal hematoma , we allowed for the option of a general surgery consultation even though the computed tomography findings were never presented . \n hematology / oncology respondents were given the option of ordering additional specialty coagulation laboratory tests ( eg , mixing studies ) . participants were additionally questioned about their experiences diagnosing underlying bleeding disorders and , in the case of nonhematologist specialists , consulting hematologist colleagues . \n conversely , hematology and hematology / oncology specialists were asked about being on the receiving end of consultations , speci...",

hematy et al . , 2009 ; ringli , 2010 ; seifert and blaukopf , 2010 ) . \n a recently published review focuses on cwi maintenance during plant cell wall morphogenesis ( wolf et al . , 2011 ) . \n similarities between the yeast and plant cwi maintenance mechanisms have also been reviewed ( hamann and denness , 2011 ) . \n therefore , the available knowledge regarding cwi maintenance during plant development and in yeast will be covered here only briefly to provide a conceptual framework regarding cellular processes involved and to illustrate the degree of functional conservation between species . \n this review will focus on recent developments regarding the role of cwi maintenance during biotic stress responses . \n it will discuss how cwi maintenance could have a previously unrecognized role in the perception of and response to biotic stress . \n while both plant and yeast cells are enveloped by cell walls , certain important differences exist that affect the biological role and function of the plant cwi maintenance mechanism . \n in addition , plant cell walls are structurally and chemically more complex than the yeast cell wall . \n this means that in plant cells the sheer number of cell wall - related signaling events during development and plant environment interaction could disguise the activity of a dedicated plant cwi maintenance mechanism . \n the yeast cwi monitoring and maintenance network is quite complex , providing an indication of the possible complexity of the plant cwi maintenance network . by combining inputs from a turgor pressure sensor ( sln1 ) , mechano - perception ( mid1/cch1 ) , and dedicated cell wall damage ( cwd ) sensors ( wsc1 , 2 , 3 , mid2 , mtl1 ) the yeast cwi maintenance network generates signals that permit highly specific responses to any challenge that impairs the functional integrity of the yeast cell wall . \n the available phenotypic and genetic data also implicate turgor pressure , mechano - perception , and cwd detection in plant cwi maintenance ( hamann et al . \n interestingly , arabidopsis histidine kinase1 ( ahk1 ) and cytokinin receptor1/arabidopsis histidine kinase4 ( cre1/ahk4 ) can at least partially rescue a yeast strain with a loss of function allele in sln1 ( urao et al . \n in addition , expression of the arabidopsis thaliana mid1 complementing activity 1 and 2 ( mca1,2 ) genes rescues a mid1-deficient yeast strain suggesting that they could function as stretch - activated calcium channels ( nakagawa et al . \n no functional homologues for the yeast cwd sensors have been identified in plants . in yeast , \n the signals generated by the sensors are relayed to the response genes via different signaling cascades involving calcineurin ( mid1/cch1 ) ; rho1/mpk1 ( wsc1 , mid2 ) , and ypd1 ( sln1 ) ( levin , 2005 ) . \n transcription factors mediating the response are skn7 , rlm1 , and swi4/6 ( levin , 2005 ) . \n the response can involve activation of genes required for cell wall biosynthetic processes , remodeling of the cytoskeleton , and cell cycle progression . \n the available data suggest both organizational and functional similarities between the yeast and plant cwi maintenance mechanism while also highlighting how signals from mechanical and chemical sensors regulate jointly the cwd response . \n the plant cell wall is comparable to an exoskeleton surrounding the plant cell and providing both structural support and protection from biotic as well as abiotic stresses . \n it consists of cellulose microfibrils , pectin , hemicelluloses , proteins , and in certain cases lignin ( somerville et al . , 2004 ) . \n plant cell walls are divided into primary ( laid down during cell elongation / differentiation ) and secondary ( formed after cell morphogenesis is concluded ) walls . in parallel , \n dependent on the presence of certain polysaccharides type i and type ii cell walls are distinguished ( popper et al . , 2011 ) . \n cellulose microfibrils are the main load bearing elements , which are cross - linked to hemicelluloses and ( in vitro ) to pectin ( dick - perez et al . , 2011 ) . \n hemicelluloses and pectin also form direct links creating a matrix in which the microfibrils are embedded like the steel mesh in a concrete wall . \n pectic polysaccharides like homogalacturonan ( hg ) are connected by calcium bridges between dimethyl - esterified parts of the molecules or through borate ester linkages in the case of rhamnogalacturonan ii ( rg ii ) . \n they are targeted by pathogen - derived cell wall degrading enzymes ( polygalacturonases ) , which generate oligogalacturonides ( ogas ) from hg ( hahn et al . , 1981 ; kars et al . , 2005 ) . \n biologically active ogas consist of chains of 915 galacturonic acid ( gala ) monomers and can function as signaling molecules ( see below ) . \n during secondary cell wall formation monolignols ( precursors for lignin ) are secreted into the cell wall space and randomly cross - linked ( vanholme et al . , 2010 ) . \n the cross - linking is dependent on the availability of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) generated by laccases and peroxidases . \n this process reinforces the wall against pathogen infection , waterproofs it , and increases structural integrity ( tronchet et al . , 2010 ; \n reduction of cellulose biosynthesis during primary cell wall formation through genetic or chemical means leads to lignin production ( ellis et al . , 2002 ; hamann et al . , \n this highlights the ability of the cell to adapt to changes in cell wall composition and provides evidence for the existence of a cwi maintenance mechanism . \n plant cell walls are capable of adjusting their composition and structure in response to pathogen infection ( dong et al . , 2008 ) . a mutation in ( cellulose synthasea3 , cesa3 ) a subunit of the cellulose synthase complex leads to ectopic production of lignin , i.e. , replacement of a missing load bearing cell wall component by another one ( cano - delgado et al \n follow up studies found that inhibition of cellulose biosynthesis during primary cell wall formation either through mutations like constitutive expression of vsp1 ( cev1 ) and ectopic lignification1 ( eli1 ) or inhibitors such as isoxaben results in transcriptional activation of stress response mechanisms ; ectopic production of ethylene ( et ) , salicylic acid ( sa ) , jasmonic acid ( ja ) , callose , and ros as well as changes in cell wall composition and structure ( ellis et al . \n , 2002 ; cano - delgado et al . , 2003 ; manfield et al . , 2004 ; hamann et al . , \n the experiments also showed that the response to cwd consists of early and late stages reminiscent of the response to pathogen infection ( denness et al . , 2011 ) . \n during the early stage , ros- and calcium - based signaling cascades are required for initiating the response to cwd ( denness et al . , 2011 ) . \n interestingly , 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid ( acc , an et precursor ) and not et itself seems to be acting as signaling substance during the early response to isoxaben with inhibition of cell expansion being an active process and not simply an automatic consequence of cellulose biosynthesis inhibition ( tsang et al . , 2011 ) . during the late stage , \n responses to cwd - like lignin deposition are initiated and the extent of lignin formation is apparently modulated by a negative feedback loop formed by ros and ja ( denness et al . , 2011 ) . \n a combination of genetic and phenotypic analysis has implicated the nadph oxidases respiratory burst oxidase homologd and f ( rbohd , f ) , the serine / threonine kinase oxidative signal inducible1 ( oxi1 ) , mca1 , the receptor - like kinase ( rlk ) theseus1 ( the1 ) as well as the ja biosynthesis genes allene oxide synthase ( aos ) and jasmonic acid resistant1 ( jar1 ) in the signaling mechanism mediating the response to cwd in arabidopsis seedlings . \n interestingly , the cev1 mutation that affects cellulose biosynthesis during primary cell wall formation also causes enhanced resistance to infection by different powdery mildews ( erysiphe orontii , e. cichoracearum , and oidium lycopersicum ; ellis and turner , 2001 ) . \n a screen for mutants causing resistance to powdery mildew infection provides further evidence of the close relationship between plant cell walls and pathogen resistance ( vogel and somerville , 2000 ) . \n three of th...",

    "input": "acute patellar dislocation is a common injury usually associated with a significant traumatic mechanism resulting in lateral displacement . \n vertical axis rotation following dislocation is a rare variant of this type of injury and can prevent closed reduction in the acute setting . \n a 32-year old gentleman presented with an irreducible patella dislocation following an unusual atraumatic mechanism . following attempts at closed reduction under sedation and regional nerve block , eventual open reduction and soft tissue reconstruction was required under general anesthetic . during the open reduction procedure , it was noted that the patella had dislocated into a lateral extra - articular position and rotated around its vertical axis . \n a review of the literature suggests dislocations such as the current presentation , are extremely rare and although have been described to occur with minor trauma , have never been described to occur following a largely atraumatic event . in such cases , \n closed reduction may be impossible even with adequate analgesia due to patella position and soft tissue obstruction . \n acute patellar dislocation is defined as the abrupt disruption in the relationship of the patella within the femoral groove . \n patellar dislocation is a relatively common occurrence and is usually managed in the emergency department with closed manipulation under sedation . \n however , when the patella itself rotates around its vertical axis during dislocation , surgical intervention is usually required . \n a 32-year old gentleman was admitted to our trauma department with a painful , immobile right knee . \n he sustained the injury externally rotating his knee whilst in  slight flexion  while he was moving from the driver s seat to the passenger s seat of his car . \n the first event was 15 years prior , when his knee twisted in flexed position while pushing a car . \n the second event was four years prior , when he sustained an injury while pushing a van , this time with the right knee fully extended . on this occasion , \n our patient had no other significant past medical or surgical history and explained his right knee was completely asymptomatic prior to this current event . on examination \n , there was an obvious deformity suggesting lateral displacement of the patella with a sulcus in the skin evident over the femoral groove . \n furthermore , the knee was held fixed in 15 degrees of flexion . due to patient positioning difficulties we were unable to obtain true ap and lateral views on x - ray . \n the radiographs demonstrated a laterally displaced and a mal - rotated patella in the vertical plane ( see figs . 1 and 2 ) . \n lateral radiograph of the right knee demonstrating rotation of patella our patient was subsequently taken to theatre where one final attempt of closed reduction was carried out under general anaesthetic and muscle relaxation . ultimately , this failed and an open reduction was performed . \n complete rupture of the medial patellofemoral ligament ( mpfl ) was identified with the patella situated lateral to the lateral femoral condyle , everted by approximately 100 degrees . \n the knee joint was washed out with normal saline and the medial patella retinaculum was repaired . after the repair , \n post - operative radiographs confirm the patella in a satisfactory position in the antero - posterior and lateral planes ( see figs . 3 and 4 ) . \n the patient was placed in an extension splint for comfort purposes immediately post - operatively . \n early mobilization was encouraged after 5 days and the patient was referred for early physiotherapy . at 3 months follow - up , our patient had no further episodes of dislocation , full range of knee extension and flexion , and normal patella tracking . \n a hypermobility assessment at this stage revealed a beighton score of 2 with extension beyond 10 degrees of both elbows only . \n intraoperative antero - posterior florous copy image following successful reduction lateral radiograph of the right knee following surgery in knee splint \n patellar dislocations can vary widely in their pattern of presentation however vertical axis rotation complicates only a small number of these cases . in 1844 , cooper described the earliest case of patellar dislocation with vertical axis rotation . \n since then , only a handful of case reports describing vertical axis rotation of the patella have been published with the majority describing the location of the patella within the femoral trochlea ( intra - articular ) [ 2 - 11 ] . our case is rare as our patient had a less common variant of extra - articular patellar dislocation complicated by vertical axis rotation and by the fact , that the causative mechanism was largely atraumatic . \n previous descriptions postulate that the prominence of the lateral femoral condyle acts as a pivot point , which can cause the patella to rotate around on its vertical axis . in this case , however , the patient denies any trauma , and instead describes externally rotating the leg whilst extended as the mechanism of injury . \n it is almost certain that the previous dislocations in our patient s case had resulted in significant damage of the mpfl . with the patient reporting his injury taking place with the knee  slightly  flexed , the function of the mpfl in this case as the primary medial restraint during the first 20 degrees of flexion was likely to be inadequate . \n previous authors have described similar cases of extra - articular lateral patellar dislocation with vertical axis rotation and have noted in their subsequent reviews of the limited literature that intra - aritcular dislocations were usually related to far more significant trauma than extra - articular dislocations [ 3 - 10 ] . \n this was also the finding in a previous report highlighting the relative minor force resulting in an extra - articular dislocation . \n we feel this may be an indication of the chronic deficiency in the mpfl likely contributing to cases of extra - articular dislocation . on reviewing the previous cases of extra - articular dislocation in the literature \n , none had described a completely atraumatic mechanism and none had discussed previous dislocations or previous surgical history in their patients . \n detailed imaging can be difficult to obtain in the acute scenario ; however in these cases ct imaging may clarify patella position and demonstrate mechanical engagement of the patella on the lateral femoral condyle . \n in one case report , ct imaging was utilized and confirmed avulsions of the vastusmedialis muscle and medial crus of the patella tendon with resultant impaction of the medial border on the patella onto the lateral femoral condyle . in this case , imaging led to the decision for open reduction being required , minimizing further attempts at closed reduction which could in theory result in further damage . \n it is difficult to be absolutely sure why attempts at closed reduction had failed in our particular case , but this is likely to be multifactorial . \n vertical axis rotation results in impaction of the lateral edge of the patella on the lateral femoral epicondyle which may result in a corresponding femoral defect resulting in a lodging effect . furthermore patient factors , namely obesity and large muscle mass around the knee made manipulation technically difficult in our case . \n open reduction under general anaesthetic is rarely necessary for routine patellar dislocations however there are some obvious advantages . \n these include ; the possibility of direct visualisation of the obvious damage to the soft tissue structures contributing to or resultant from the dislocation . in our case it was likely \n the mpfl had been damaged previously and repair is likely to help in restoring central patella tracking and overall stability . in this case , the patient was noted as having a shallow trochlea which might have accounted for his increased tendency to dislocations . \n direct visual inspection may also help determine patients who are at risk of recurrent dislocations due to factors relating to their bony morphology and allow the surgeon to plan further management accordingly . \n lastly , visualisation of the articulating surfaces allows the surgeon to identify and address any osteochondral defects and corresponding loose bodies which may otherwise have contributed to long term future problems requiring eventual surgical intervention . \n from our experience with this case , difficulty in reducing a dislocated patella should alert surgeons to the possibility of an extra - articular dislocation with possible vertical axis rotation . in these scenarios , multiple attempts at reduction \n we were able to achieve adequate analgesia and sedation using local and regional anaesthesia , without successful reduction of the dislocation . \n although some authors have demonstrated successful closed reduction with the use of local anaesthetic and muscle relaxants , this is n...",

    "input": "in recent years , the concept of minimal intervention ( mi ) has prevailed in dentistry . \n therefore , the importance of diagnosing caries at an early stage has increased . in conventional procedures , \n the diagnosis of caries has mainly consisted of visual inspection and tactile assessment with probing . \n however , lussi   reported that the sensitivity of detecting caries was 0.62 by visual inspection and 0.82 by probing . \n in addition , the pressure of probing can damage the demineralized fissure and increase the risk that caries progress [ 3 , 4 ] . to promote mi , diagnosis without a probe has been recommended . \n the laser fluorescence - based caries detection device diagnodent ( kavo , germany ) has been introduced as an alternative . however , no single detection method for caries is sufficient ; therefore , the combination of some detection methods has been recommended [ 57 ] . \n recent improvements in the personal computer have made the process of digital imaging more efficient and convenient . \n if the shape of caries can be quantified , and the relationship between the numerical value and the condition of the lesion can be demonstrated , this information would be helpful to diagnose dental caries . \n the authors of this paper have previously shown that the fractal dimension and proportion of the area of pit - and - fissure discoloration to the area of occlusal surface obtained by digital imaging were significantly correlated with the depth of the caries and the diagnodent values in extracted teeth . \n for assessment of the method as a diagnostic system , the ability of the diagnosis , such as the sensitivity , the specificity , and the accuracy , should be researched in clinical situation . \n the aim of this study was to assess the possibility of the clinical application of the diagnosis of occlusal caries using digital imaging by examining the sensitivity , the specificity , and the accuracy in comparison with the diagnodent values and the dentists ' diagnoses . \n one hundred teeth ( 36 premolars and 64 molars ) with pit - and - fissure discoloration from 19 outpatients were examined at the clinic of oral diagnosis and general dentistry , dental hospital , tokyo medical and dental university . \n the occlusal surface of each tooth was washed with the robinson brush to remove dental plaque without any abrasive paste . \n then , pit - and - fissure discoloration was dried by air and measured three times using diagnodent . \n the mean scores were used as the diagnodent values of the teeth ( dd ) . \n next , the occlusal surface of each tooth was photographed as large as possible with an intraoral digital camera ( penscope , morita , japan ) . \n each image was stored in a personal computer using a video capture interface ( pc - mdvd / u2 , buffalo , japan ) . without knowing the dd , \n a dentist preliminarily diagnosed each tooth using visual inspection and tactile examination to decide which treatment plan would be appropriate ( preventive or operative ) . \n the clinical diagnosis of preventive treatment for teeth was classified as co. on the other hand , carious lesions requiring operative treatment were removed in a conventional clinical way . if the resulting cavity preparation was limited in the enamel , then the clinical diagnosis was classified as c1 . if the resulting cavity preparation reached the dentin , and sound tissue still remained between the cavity and the pulp chamber , then the clinical diagnosis was classified as c2 . \n five dentists ranging from 3 to 15 years of professional experience examined the teeth after calibration of the criteria of the caries assessment conducted before the study ; the calibration was done as follows ; first , the five dentists examined 30 extracted teeth and decide which treatment plan would be appropriate ( preventive or operative ) . at that time \n then , the teeth were sliced pallarel to the teeth axis and to the depth of lesion for each tooth was determined . \n at last , the dentists discussed to accord the treatment planning for each tooth referring the depth of the lesion . \n the digital photographs obtained were processed and analyzed using image analysis software ( image j , nih , usa ) . \n first , each image was converted to an 8-bit gray - scale image , in which the density of grayness of each pixel was linearly scaled from min 0 ( black ) to max 255 ( white ) . \n then , the occlusal surface in the image was isolated from the background using a density histogram of the image , and the area was measured . \n pit - and - fissure discoloration was also isolated from the occlusal surface using the density histogram , and the area was measured . \n the proportion of the area of pit - and - fissure discoloration to the area of the occlusal surface was calculated ( pa ) . \n next , the image of the isolated pit - and - fissure discoloration was converted into a binary image , in which the density of pit - and - fissure discoloration was 0 , and its background was 255 , followed by calculating the fractal dimension of pit - and - fissure discoloration ( fd ) . \n differences in fd , pa , and dd between each clinical diagnosis were analyzed using two - way anova and games - howell test to reveal the clinical diagnosis and the effect of the examining dentists . \n the correlation between the clinical diagnosis and each fd , pa , and dd was analyzed using spearman 's correlation coefficient . \n discriminant formulas were obtained using discriminant analysis with the treatment plan ( preventive / operative ) as the objective variable and fd , pa , and dd as explanatory variables . \n sensitivity and specificity were calculated by applying fd , pa , and dd to each discriminant formula . \n the accuracy , ratio of the number of teeth showing accordance between the treatment plan decided by the dentists and the predictive treatment plan decided using the discriminant formula to the number of all the teeth , was also obtained . \n the entire process was approved by the ethics committee of the faculty of dentistry , tokyo medical and dental university ( no . 317 ) . \n fd , pa , and dd values corresponding to each clinical diagnosis are shown in table 1 . \n the two - way anova revealed that the fd , pa , and dd were different among the clinical diagnosis ( p < .01 ) . \n on the other hand , the difference of the examining dentists did not affect the fd , pa , and dd . \n spearman 's correlation coefficients between the clinical diagnosis and each fd , pa , and dd were 0.743 , 0.700 , and 0.652 , respectively ( p < .01 ) . \n there were also significant correlations among fd , pa , and dd ( p < .01 ) . \n table 2 shows the discriminant formula , sensitivity , specificity , and accuracy of each explanatory variable . \n based on the discriminant formula of each explanatory variable , the thresholds of fd , pa , and dd between preventive and operative treatments were 1.20 , 0.012 , and 28.8 , respectively . \n the sensitivity of fd was greater than that of pa , dd , and the combination of fd and pa . \n the specificity of pa was greater than that of fd , dd , and the combination of fd and pa . \n the accuracy of the combination of fd and pa was greater than that of fd , pa , and dd . \n previously , it was reported that the fractal dimension and the proportion of the area of pit - and - fissure discoloration to the area of occlusal surface were significantly correlated with the depth of the caries and the diagnodent values in extracted teeth . in this study , \n the fractal dimensions for c0 , c1 and c2 in the former study were 0.97 , 1.30 , and 1.52 , respectively . \n these results indicate that image analysis of molar pit - and - fissure discoloration was clinically useful for the diagnosis of caries . \n an increase of the proportion of the area of discoloration corresponded to a change of the volume of caries lesion , while an increase of the fractal dimension corresponded to a change of the shape of the lesion caused by caries progression . \n a fractal is a geometric shape , possessing characteristics of self - similarity or self - affinity , and widely observed in nature [ 10 , 11 ] . \n recently , fractals have been in the spotlight in the field of medicine , and research has been introduced regarding its use in the field of diagnosis [ 1214 ] . \n for example , a point is described as the zero dimension ; a straight line is described as the first dimension , and a plane is described as the second dimension . \n such decimal dimensions can be obtained by expanding the definition of the dimension as the rate at which the perimeter ( or the surface area ) of an object increases , and the measurement scale is reduced . several ways to measure the fractal dimension have been introduced . in this study \n , the authors used a simple way to determine the fractal dimension called box counting . in this method , \n a grid of squares is placed over the object , and the number of squares through which any part ...",

form are not stable \n in serum and therefore have a limited application for in vivo studies ( figure s2 , supporting information ) . replacing l - form amino acids \n with d - form to improve the peptide stability leads to high \n cost production . \n thus , the synthesis and development of cyclic \n cpps containing short amino acid sequence with less toxicity is desired . herein , we designed acylated cyclic polyarginine peptides ( acpps ) \n containing five arginine residues and investigated their ability as \n cell - penetrating peptides . \n we compared acpps with a corresponding \n acylated linear polyarginine peptide ( alpp ) and a nonacylated cyclic \n polyarginine as controls . \n we hypothesize that the combination of acylation \n and cyclization of short polyarginine peptides having less than six \n arginine residues will increase the intracellular uptake and can generate \n peptides with molecular transporter properties . for convenience , square \n brackets [ ] and parentheses ( ) \n phosphopeptide ptyr -

    "input": "as of 2014 , the worldwide prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) was estimated to be 9% among adults aged 18 years with great impact on mortality , particularly in low- and middle - income countries ( lmic ) [ 1 , 2 ] . moreover , globally , approximately 25% to 75% of diabetes cases remain undiagnosed [ 3 , 4 ] , until further complications , especially at the macro- and micro - vascular level , manifest clinically . in latin america , \n an important strategy to prevent or delay t2 dm complications is the early identification of those with undiagnosed diabetes ; yet , universal screening for diabetes at the population level is not practical in resource - limited settings . \n the american diabetes association recommends the use of glucose test as t2 dm screening in people with overweight and obesity as well as in those with other risk factors . as a result \n , risk assessment scores have been developed to address this problem in a simple and inexpensive way . \n most of the available algorithms for diabetes screening have been developed in caucasian [ 79 ] and asian populations [ 1013 ] and very few in other ethnic groups [ 14 , 15 ] . to date , one diabetes risk score has been developed and validated in latin america so far which was derived from one urban area in brazil , thus bearing limited generalizability to the wider region . \n furthermore , it is well established that before adopting existing risk scores as screening tools in different populations and ethnic groups , their performance needs to be evaluated , calibrated , or validated in local settings . as the american diabetes association , the peruvian ministry of health recommends diabetes screening in general population with fasting glucose in adults aged 40 to 70 years with risk factors . \n however , fasting glucose is not always available in primary care settings , especially in semiurban and rural areas . as a result , a major challenge to be overcome in many countries is the implementation of a simple , fast , and laboratory - free based screening method . \n consequently , we aimed to develop a simple laboratory - free risk score to identify people with undiagnosed diabetes and incident diabetes in peru , a latin american country that spans coastal , andean , and rainforest settings . in order to do so \n , this work benefited from two large - scale population - based surveys : the first one , representative at the national level , was used to develop the score , and the second one , a cohort study , was utilized for external validation . \n the national survey of nutritional and biochemical indicators for noncommunicable diseases ( eninbsc in spanish ) , conducted by the peruvian national institute of health , was used to develop our predictive model . \n this was complemented with the cronicas cohort study , whose baseline and longitudinal information was used to validate the risk score . \n the eninbsc is a national population - based survey carried out in peru between august 2004 and april 2005 , designed to estimate the prevalence of hypertension , type 2 diabetes mellitus , and other risk factors for noncommunicable diseases at the national and regional level . \n potential participants were those aged 20 years , habitual residents in the study area , and able to provide consent for their participation in the study . \n pregnant women and those currently breastfeeding were excluded from the study . as per design , the eninbsc sample was stratified according to peru 's five major regions of the country : lima , rest of the coast , urban highlands , rural highlands , and jungle . in each stratum , cluster of blocks \n the cronicas cohort study is an ongoing cardiopulmonary project aimed to estimate the prevalence and incidence of hypertension , diabetes mellitus , and obesity in four different settings in peru that differ in terms of their urbanicity and altitude : pampas de san juan de miraflores , in the highly urbanized lima , puno in the altitude ( 3,825 meters above the sea level ) contributing with rural and urban areas , and tumbes , a semiurban area in the northern coast of peru . \n the study started in september 2010 and a follow - up visit was completed in march 2014 . \n a sex- and age - stratified sample was selected at random for each of the settings and all participants aged 35 years , full time residents in the study area , and able to consent , were enrolled . \n follow - up data used for this analysis was collected , on average , at 30 months after baseline . \n the first one lasted on average 40 minutes and was carried out to apply a face - to - face questionnaire regarding data about household characteristics , demographics , lifestyles behaviors , risk factors , and blood pressure measurements . \n the second visit lasted 30 minutes on average and was planned to have an appropriate period of fasting for blood sampling for glucose , total cholesterol , hdl - cholesterol , and the remaining anthropometric measures ( height , weight , and waist circumference ) using standard procedures . \n similarly , the procedures of the cronicas study has been published elsewhere . in brief , participants responded to a face - to - face questionnaire applied by trained community health workers . \n data collected comprised risk factors for cardiovascular disease based on a modified version of the who step approach questionnaire for surveillance of noncommunicable disease . \n a period of 8 to 12 hours of fasting was required for blood sampling to collect fasting glucose , total cholesterol , and hdl - cholesterol . \n height , weight , and waist circumference were also assessed , and blood pressure was measured in triplicate after five minutes of resting using an automatic monitor ( omron hem-780 ) previously validated in adult 's population . in both studies , \n diabetes was defined as any of the following conditions : fasting glucose 7.0  mmol / l ( 126  mg / dl ) and/or self - report of physician diagnosis . \n fasting glucose was assessed by an enzymatic colorimetric method ( glucose oxidase god - pap ) in both studies . after excluding individuals without known diabetes , undiagnosed diabetes \n variables included in the analyses were built to guarantee similarities between both studies : sex ; age ( < 55 and 55 years ) ; education ( in years ) ; self - reported smoking ( current versus never / former smoker ) ; alcohol use ( user versus never user ) ; self - reported diabetes in first - degree relatives ( participant 's parents and/or siblings ) ; and levels of physical activity ( low versus moderate / high levels , based on the transport - related domain of the ipaq ) . \n anthropometric measurements included in the analysis were body mass index ( ( bmi ) , < 25 , 2529.9 , and 30  kg / m ) , waist circumference ( < 90 , 9099.9 , and 100  cm ) , waist - to - height ratio ( < 0.50 , 0.500.59 , 0.600.69 , and 0.70 ) , and hypertension ( measured or previously diagnosed ) . a total of 4,206 participants were enrolled in the eninbsc , but only 2,472 were included in this analysis . \n reasons for exclusion were 1,524 because of age < 35 years to make both databases comparable , 129 because of no data about fasting plasma glucose levels being available , and 81 because of known diagnosis of diabetes . in the cronicas study , 3,601 participants were enrolled at baseline but only 2,948 records were analyzed as 465 had no data about glucose levels , and 188 were excluded because of previous diagnosis of diabetes . \n in addition , only data from 2,577 participants was used in the longitudinal assessment of the risk score ( comparison of baseline characteristics among those included and excluded from longitudinal analysis is shown in online supplement : e - table 1 ; see supplementary material available online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2016/8790235 ) . \n initially , population characteristics of both studies were tabulated using proportions in the case of categorical variables and means and standard deviation ( sd ) with numerical variables . \n then , the prevalence and 95% confidence intervals ( 95% ci ) of total diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes were estimated in each study . \n the risk score was derived from data of the eninbsc survey taking into account the multistage sampling strategy of the study . \n each potential risk factor ( i.e. , sex , age , family history of diabetes , etc . ) was assessed in bivariate models using logistic regression and undiagnosed diabetes as the dependent variable . \n then , risk factors with a p value < 0.10 in the bivariate analysis were included in a multiple logistic regression model using stepwise backward elimination with a significance level of 5% . the hosmer -

acquired pneumonias . \n this bacterium has also been associated with pharyngitis , bronchitis , otitis , influenza - like illness , sinusitis and myocarditis.1214 conflicting results have been reported about the relationship between c. pneumonia and atherosclerosis . \n west et al.15 apfalter et al.,16 and zibaeenezhad et al.17 reported no association between c. pneumoniae and atherosclerosis but others found significant association between c. pneumoniae and atherosclerosis.61819 the results of jha et al.,6 dabiri et al.18 and sessa et al.19 support the idea that c. pneumoniae may have a role in the development of atherosclerosis . \n this controversy about the role c. pneumoniae in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis emphasizes the importance of more research works . \n the aim of this study was to demonstrate whether there is any difference between two group of patients with coronary atherosclerotic plaque and subjects without coronary atherosclerosis for the presence of c. pneumoniae dna by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) method . \n this case - control study was carried out on 60 formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded ( ffpe ) coronary artery biopsies in the molecular pathology laboratory , ghaem hospital , mashhad , iran in 2010 . \n coronary artery tissues were selected from another study that was performed previously by our colleagues for determining prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques in autopsy cases with non - cardiac death in northeast iran . in this study , left coronary artery ( lca ) , right coronary artery ( rca ) and left circumflex artery ( lcx ) had been evaluated grossly and microscopically . \n our materials included 30 coronary artery tissues with atherosclerotic plaques that were defined as study group , and 30 coronary artery tissues without atherosclerotic plaques that served as the control group . \n archived slides of the two groups were reviewed by two pathologists for confirmation of diagnosis , tissue adequacy and selection of the best paraffin blocks for dna extraction . \n for all subjects , the weight and height were determined , and the body mass index ( bmi ) was calculated . \n five to seven , 5-m - thick sectionswere cut from each ffpe specimen under sterile conditions , and then the dna was extracted by using proteinase k and non - heating dna extraction method.20 dna concentration was determined by using the thermo scientific nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer , and specimens with low dna content ( < 20 ng/l ) were excluded from the study . \n pcr was performed for detecting c. pneumoniae dna by using the pcr kits ( dna technology ( jsc ) , pcr kit , moscow , russia ) . \n 10 l of pcr master mix and 0.5 l unit of taqpolymerase ( hot start taq dna polymerase ) were added into each paraffin sealed tube and were mixed , then 5 l ( 100 ng ) of dna samples were added ( except for positive and negative controls ) and were spun at 1,000 rpm for 3 - 5 s. the tubes were placed into applied biosystems ( abi ) veriti thermal cycler and pcr was performed with the program of 180 s at 94c for the first step and then 45 cycles was run as follows : 50 s at 94c , 50 s at 64c , 50 s at 72c . \n amplified pcr products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel , stained with ethidium bromide , and photographed under ultraviolet light by gel documentation instrument . \n pcr was interpreted as positive when the dna band corresponds to the band of the positive control ( 254bp ) in addition to the internal control band ( ic:370 bp ) . \n results of pcr in control and atherosclerotic groups were analyzed with spss version 11.5 by a statistician . \n we used fisher 's exact test for comparison of categorical variables and independent sample t - test for continuous variable in patients and control groups . \n the age range in the control group was 20 - 46 years with a mean ( standard deviation ) age of 26.0 ( 6.41 ) years . in the study group , \n it ranges from 18 to 50 years with a mean ( sd ) age of 32.0 ( 9.46 ) years and the t - test showed no significant difference between the ages of patients in the study and control groups ( p=0.97 ) . \n twenty - five patients ( 83.3% ) were males and five patients ( 16.7% ) were females . \n the male to female ratio was 5:1 and no significant difference was seen between study and control groups for gender ( p = 1.00 ) by fisher 's exact test . \n the mean bmi of the patients in the study and control groups were 24.4 ( 3.77 ) and 23.9 ( 2.62 ) kg / m respectively [ table 1 ] . the frequency of atherosclerotic plaques in the different vessels of heart of the patients in the study is as shown in table 2 . as a result , the possibility of the appearance of advanced atherosclerotic plaques s in lca was higher than the two other vessels . \n concurrent occurrences of different stages of atherosclerosis were seen in our patients . only one vessel involvement with fibro - fatty morphology ( mild ) \n was seen in five patients ( 16.7% ) , one vessel with advanced plaque was observed in three patients ( 10.0% ) , seven patients ( 23.3% ) had one vessel with fibro - fatty and one vessel with advanced plaque , two vessels with advanced plaque were noticed in six patients ( 20.0% ) , three vessels with advanced plaque were observed in five patients ( 16.7% ) and four patients ( 13.3% ) had two vessels with advanced plaque and one fibro - fatty morphology . \n comparisons between patients with coronary atherosclerosis and controls for weight , height and body mass index the frequency of atherosclerotic plaques in different vessels of the heart in the study group positive pcr result for c. pneumonia was seen in one ( 3.3% ) sample among the 30 coronary artery tissues with atherosclerosis ( advanced plaque ) , while all the control samples were negative . \n fisher 's exact test showed no significant difference for detection of c. pneumoniae between samples of coronary artery with and without atherosclerotic plaque ( p = 1 ) . \n ischemic heart disease could be observed in the absence of its major risk factors such as increasing age , male gender , hypertension , hyperlipidemia , smoking and dm . \n inflammatory cells are seen during all steps of atherogenesis , and some infectious agents may trigger this inflammation.113 although some studies showed that c. pneumoniae can increase the risk of atherosclerosis , 61819 but we did not find any significant difference in the frequency of c. pneumoniae dna isolation in the coronary arteries with and without atherosclerosis by pcr method . \n we believe that at least two important factors can account for this discrepancy in the results from previous studies : methodology and epidemiology . \n c pneumonia infection can be diagnosed by various methods such as serology with an increase in serum antibodies against the organism , dna detectionby pcr , immunocytochemistry , electron microscopyand c. pneumonia isolation by culture.14 in other studies , the most widely used method for identifying of c. pneumoniae infection was based on antibody detection . \n the frequency of antibody against c. pneumoniae starts to rise in children and is observed approximately in 50% of adolescents.1214 somesero - epidemiologic studies have shown a relationship between c. pneumoniae and atherosclerosis . \n saikku et al.,21 podsiady et al.22 and romano et al.23 detected a higher level of antibody against c. pneumoniae in chd compared to control group but zibaeenezhad et al.,17 romeo et al.,24 and ericson et al.,25 found that the presence of antibodies was unable to predict coronary artery events ....",

induced nmb was seen . \n therefore , we injected a bolus of iv sugammadex 200 mg to reverse the residual nmb . \n once again , the nmb was completely reversed within 2 min , and tracheal extubation was performed in the or uneventfully ( table 1 ) . \n a decision by surgeon was made to perform angiography of the left external carotid artery with subsequent embolization of the bleeding vessel . \n embolization of the left ascending pharyngeal artery was performed with polyvinyl alcohol particle ( 350 m ) and tornado embolization microcoil ( cook , bloomington , usa ) ( 3/2 mm ) ( fig . \n the patient 's postoperative course was uneventful , and hb was found to be 10.5 g / dl . \n pth occurs in approximately 1 in 20 adults ( 5.1% ) , and more than half of patients who bleed are likely to require a procedure of some type to control their hemorrhage . \n aberrant arterial blood supply to the tonsillar region derived from the internal carotid artery or the carotid bulb may be present . \n to control bleeding , electrocauterization , packing of the pharynx , or angiographic embolization of the feeding artery may become necessary . \n the endovascular embolization due to refractory bleeding after tonsillectomy proved to be a valuable treatment method as an effective alternative to surgical intervention . \n it is a safe and permanent treatment option in this potentially life - threatening complication . in a case such as this , \n the aberrant arterial blood supply in the left inferior pole of tonsillectomy site caused continuous bleeding . \n the anesthesiologist has experienced difficulties , because an experienced surgeon has embarrassed due to repetitive bleeding . in the first induction of anesthesia \n , no problems were encountered with conventional anesthesia , although neuromuscular monitoring was not performed . \n the most common anesthetic used for rsi during the management of children with pth is succinylcholine . since the introduction of sugammadex , rsi with rocuronium followed by reversal with sugammadex allowed for earlier establishment of spontaneous ventilation than with succinylcholine , which has many adverse side events . during the second round of anesthesia , rocuronium 100 mg ( 1 mg / kg ) \n was injected for rsi , followed by reversal with sugammadex 200 mg ( 2 mg / kg ) at deep nmb ( tof = 0 ) . during the operation , \n nmb monitoring was difficult due to problems attaching leads to the arms during the operation . \n tof stimulation was applied at the ulnar nerve using conventional instrumental monitoring rather than quantitative monitoring due to convenience . \n deep nmb was maintained for bleeding control in an attempt to not disturb the procedure . during nmb reversal \n , we found an absence of fade on tof monitoring just 2 min after sugammadex was administered . \n re - administration of 0.6 mg / kg rocuronium could then be given after sugammadex at the recommended waiting time of 6 h . during the third anesthesia induction , \n an on - call resident used rocuronium 40 mg for muscle relaxation during intubation followed by reversal with sugammadex 200 mg at deep nmb ( tof = 0 ) . \n an absence of fade on tof monitoring was shown 2 min after sugammadex was given . for the fourth round of anesthesia , the same resident used rocuronium 40 mg for intubation 2 h and 35 min after the previous nmb reversal with sugammadex . \n however , we believe this decision was made without considering the recent sugammadex use . when rocuronium is used within a short time interval ( less than 6 h ) after sugammadex administration , the onset time of rocuronium may be prolonged and may also have an unpredictable duration of action . \n we suspect that the additional dose of rocuronium 10 mg due to bucking may be related to the short time interval between sugammadex and rocuronium administration . in situations such as these , \n the benzylisoquinoline class of medications are recommended instead of re - administering rocuronium within 6 h after sugammadex . \n when considering this case , cisatracurium for muscle relaxation and intubation may have been a better choice for the fourth round anesthesia . however , one drawback of cisatracurium is the slower onset time than rocuronium . \n reversal of the rocuronium - induced nmb with pyridostigmine a...",

    "input": "infertility has been recognized as a public health issue worldwide ( 1 ) leading to an increasing need to the use of assisted reproductive technologies ( art ) , including in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) . \n after the first reported case of ivf in 1978(2 ) art enabled millions of people to have their own children in cases when pregnancy did not occur under natural circumstances . \n 700,000 cycles a year in the usa and europe together ( 3,4 ) . despite of evolving intracytoplasmatic sperm injection ( icsi ) technique \n a success rate of 25% and 28% has been reported in 2005(7 ) and 2008(8 ) , respectively . \n nowadays , this rate went up to 32% ( 9 ) , which can not be considered as a significant development . \n earlier clinical protocols preferred multiple embryo transfer , but multiple gestations can result in the increased risk of preterm delivery ( 10 - 16 ) . \n other studies report that multiple gestations also increased the risk of low birth weight cerebral palsy ( 17 ) . in the us alone , preterm births resulting from multiple pregnancies during ivf cause a 1 billion usd extra cost to the social insurance ( 18 ) . in order to exclude the discussed risk factors , \n it is imperative , however , that accurate and economical methods should be developed to ensure that the most viable euploid embryo is selected for transfer . \n ideally , such tests would be noninvasive , lessening the risks to the embryo and reducing costs and workload in the embryology laboratory ( 19 ) . \n the biggest issue with pre - implantation viability assessment is that due to ethical reasons any assay should be completely non - invasive because no one can predict what kind of interference would be the unwanted result in the later embryonic development . \n the most apparent  and routinely applied - way of the assessment of viability is the morphological evaluation of in vitro fertilized embryos using microscopy . \n there are several morphological features described which could be used for viability assessment purposes , these are dependent on the time spent after fertilization . right after fertilization in the 1-cell embryo the size and symmetry of the two pronuclei can be examined . \n the time of the first cell division is also a good predictor of later implantation potential , as zygotes that divide early tend to develop more frequently to the blastocyst stage . \n criteria as cleavage rate and blastomere shape and symmetry , an adequate trophectoderm layer ( te ) and an inner cell mass ( icm ) is a morphological marker of the later stages ( 5,20 ) . \n not only can the morphology of the fertilized embryo be used for further prediction of implantation potential , but morphological defects of the retrieved oocyte as well . fertilization and pregnancy rate correlates with the grade of cumulus - oocyte complexes , and embryos originating from dysmorphic oocytes show a larger grade of pregnancy loss ( 21 - 23 ) . \n the cleavage stages of morulae and blastocysts or the symmetry and patterns of cell division are also notable and frequently used aspects , and are often examined during the prediction of embryo viability ( 23 ) . \n the biggest issue of morphological assessment is that it is still a highly subjective method ( 20 ) . \n the reason is partly due to the fact that the final decision is made by a clinician , and not by an objective test result , and secondly it is does matter how important are the individual morphological features in the final conclusion ( 24 - 26 ) . to overcome the different practice of laboratories worldwide in 2011 an international consensus ( istanbul consensus ) has been reached on embryo viability assessment ( 27 ) \n . the selected morphological markers of respective stage embryos , the weighing of individual features and a scoring system has been set up . \n the limitations due to static time - point observation , is now solved with the use of time - lapse microscopy ( 28,29 ) . \n time - lapse microscopy also enables the observation of dynamics of cytoplasmic movements and cytokinesis , reflecting the functionality of microtubule and actin cytoskeleton , which is critical for proper development . in our laboratory \n , we aimed to improve the success rate of implantation by adopting and further optimizing the istanbul consensus . \n this score has been called as the optimized criteria system ( ocs ) . according to this scoring \n , 3-day old embryos were divided into two subgroups : the subgroup with low blastomere number ( less than 7 ) and with high blastomere number ( 7 or more ) . \n symmetric position of blastomeres indicates the rate of symmetry of holoblastic cleavage along the embryo axis . \n it was classified as good ( full symmetry ) ; fair ( light asymmetry ) ; or poor ( evident asymmetry ) . \n the percent values of fragmentation are based on the ratio of fragmented to total cell numbers . as a further modification to the istanbul consensus , \n embryos were considered as good if the fragmentation rate was < 15% ( instead of the original 10% ) . \n this shift from 10 to 15% was the result of our observation that a fairly high proportion of the embryos between 10 - 15% appeared to be viable . in summary the optimized criteria system ( ocs ) \n highlights 3 modified or new parameters : fragmentation ( with a more permissive criterion of < 15% in the  good  category ) ; symmetry and the blastomere number . in addition , the blastomere size was evaluated according to the original istanbul consensus . \n a scoring - map was created to facilitate the evaluation ( table 1 ) as far as the 5-day old embryos are concerned , we modified the original istanbul consensus for blastocysts by leaving out the hatched stage from the evaluation . \n the istanbul consensus for the 5-day old embryos has a shortcoming , i.e. it does not express the viability of embryos with a single category ( good , fair , poor ) . \n we tried to overcome this by using a scoring map ( table 2 ) . in conclusion \n , we constructed a composite score for day-3 , as well as day-5 old embryos , based on morphological parameters . \n as it is evident from the results , this composite score is sensitive to evaluate viability ( figure 1 ) \n another possibility for non - invasive embryo viability assessment is the metabolomic examination of the culture medium surrounding the in vitro fertilized embryo . \n metabolomic , ( proteomic ) profiling of spent embryo culture ( sec ) offers an exceptional , non - invasive opportunity for the assessment of embryo viability ( 30,31 ) . \n the metabolomic profiling ( 32,33 ) of early embryo development might mean the analysis of the total metabolome by following the changes of several selected compounds , metabolomic analysis using unidentified , but significantly differing metabolomic changes , or by the analysis of a limited population of nutrients or end products . \n the common feature in all three concepts is that they are concentrating on the metabolomic alterations caused by differently developing embryos in the culture medium . \n very simple idea is the monitoring of glucose consumption or pyruvate formation , since this would directly indicate the metabolism of the developing embryo and it is an obvious conclusion that a metabolically active embryo would have higher implantation potential . \n some authors reported that the identification of these parameters resulted in successful prediction of embryo implantation potential , but other research groups describe contradictory results ( 34 , 35 ) . \n the amino acid profile of culture media is also used in the prediction of implantation potential , though not exclusively as an independent parameter , rather in combination with morphological features ( 36 ) . \n the detection of unidentified metabolomic changes using near infra - red ( nir ) or raman spectroscopy ( 37 , 38 ) is a very interesting and challenging possibility . \n more complicated is the concept when unknown , new biomarker molecules of embryo viability are searched for , assuming that these biomarkers were secreted by the embryo . \n the difficulty of the concept is that only 4 - 8 cells are present in the culture medium ; thus a very sensitive analytical tool is required . \n mass spectrometry ( ms ) has the potential of specific and sensitive quantification in a wide spectrum of molecular mass ranges and therefore suites well the needs of metabolomic or proteomic fingerprinting and quantification . in parallel to the spreading of mass spectrometry , proteomics is also an emerging field in the understanding of embryo development ( 39,40 ) . \n the analysis of the embryonic secretome ( 41,42 ) provides information of the total transcriptome of the developing embryos . \n mass spectrometry can be used both in targeted and discovery analysis with accurate quantification of identified biomarkers after molecular identification by bottom - up or top - down proteomics using tandem or multiple ms ( 43 - 46 ) . in a recent publication fr...",

    "input": "leaf senescence is the last phase of plant development and a highly coordinated process regulated by a large number of senescence associated genes ( sags ) ( 12 ) . \n leaf senescence can either be naturally induced during development stages , or stimulated by environmental factors including darkness , nutritional deficiency and various stresses ( 13 ) . \n premature senescence is an important factor leading to the decrease of crop yield and quality , which becomes an increasing concern due to the global climate change in the recent years . \n many advances in the understanding of leaf senescence at the molecular level had been achieved through the identification and characterization of hundreds of sags and senescence - related mutants in arabidopsis thaliana , lycopersicon esculentum and nicotiana tabaccum ( 14 ) . \n microarray expression profiling in arabidopsis revealed that more than 800 genes are up - regulated during the course of leaf senescence ( 5 ) . among them , more than 200 transcription factors , including wrky , nac , mads , myb , bzip and bhlh family members , are involved in the regulation of leaf senescence , indicating that leaf senescence is governed by complex transcriptional regulatory networks . \n molecular and genetic studies of leaf senescence in recent years led to the accumulation of a large volume of scattered information related to sags . \n the construction of a leaf senescence related database with wide - spread collection and systematic annotation of sags may provide a useful resource and a good starting point for the further study of the molecular aspects of leaf senescence . \n some initial efforts to this end had been made ; including the online website of plant senescence network ( sennet ) constructed by thomas and his colleagues ( http://www.sidthomas.net/plant_senescence/ ) and the corresponding senwiki web pages ( http://www.sidthomas.net/senwiki/ ) . \n sennet brings together various community information including meetings , laboratories , websites and useful links related to plant senescence , while senwiki provides general information and knowledge of senescence with texts and images . \n however , a wide - ranging compilation and detailed annotation of known sags that would be of great help and demand to the systemic study of leaf senescence at the molecular level has yet to be done . in this regard , \n we have developed a leaf senescence database ( lsd ) ( http://www.eplantsenescence.org/ ) by retrieving and integrating information from research papers and public databases . at present \n 1145 sags from 21 species were manually curated and categorized into several groups according to their function . \n users can browse the entries in the database to obtain information including literatures , mutants , phenotypes , expression profiles , mirna interactions , orthologs in other plants and cross links to protein domain and family databases . \n users can also search the database easily through the  text search interface with locus names , keywords and author names , etc . \n we have implemented the blast tool kit for sequence similarity search against nucleotide or protein sequences of these sags in the lsd . a major feature of the lsd is the integration of a bioinformatics platform weblab we had developed previously ( 6 ) , which allows users to perform extensive sequence analysis of the sags they are interested in . \n all the sag sequences are freely available for downloading . help information including user guides , a tutorials and faqs are also available online . \n we plan to identify putative sags from completely sequenced genomes and add them into the database in the near future , and improve the user interface based on user feedback , provide more help documents with case studies , add more links to other useful sites , and update the database in time with more leaf senescence related data available . \n we hope that lsd could be a useful resource for the leaf senescence research community , as well as a gateway for the collaborative project we are working with both domestic and international colleagues . \n we made an extensive literature survey and collected approximately 200 leaf senescence related papers published before october 2010 on major plant biology journals including plant cell , plant physiology , plant journal , new phytologist , journal of experimental botany , among others . \n a total of 1145 sags from 21 species including arabidopsis , rice and so on , were identified and manually verified based on genetic , genomic , proteomic , physiological and other experimental evidence . among them , \n 96 and 58 genes were supported by mutational investigation or transgenic over -

    "input": "many studies have shown that bracket debonding can cause enamel loss , particularly when the fracture occurs at the enamel - adhesive interface \n . enamel damage may be in the form of enamel cracks , which may propagate during debonding [ 13 ] . \n acid - etching , rinsing , drying and applying resin and bonding agents are the routine steps of conventional orthodontic bracket bonding . \n concurrent with studies on the efficacy of the conventional technique , many studies , aimed at reducing the number of steps necessary for adhesion , have examined new bonding techniques with clinically adequate bond strength but less etching depth [ 56 ] . \n traditional methods of bonding orthodontic brackets to teeth rely on acid etching to achieve adequate retention . \n however , maintaining a sound enamel surface after bracket removal is of primary concern to clinicians . \n bond failure at the bracket - adhesive interface or within the adhesive is generally considered \n safer  than a fracture at the enamel - adhesive interface ; this is because studies have demonstrated that enamel fracture can occur during debonding . on the other hand , \n if a considerable amount of adhesive remains on the tooth surface after debonding , more chair time is required to remove the residual adhesive . \n in addition , the process of removing the residual adhesive results in further enamel loss . \n all - purpose or multi - purpose , self - adhesive resin cements are now commercially available in the market . \n they are capable of bonding to different substrates such as enamel , dentin , amalgam , metal and porcelain [ 910 ] . \n these cements require no surface pre - treatment due to their monomer and filler content and initiation technology . \n the phosphoric acid methacrylates react with basic fillers in the luting cement and the hydroxyapatite of the tooth structure [ 1112 ] . \n these self - adhesive cements do not require an  etch and rinse  phase as they are capable of conditioning the tooth surface and simultaneously preparing it for adhesion . \n this not only shortens the clinical application time , but also significantly reduces technique - sensitivity and risk of errors during application or manipulation . \n the aim of the current study was to assess the enamel cracks after debonding of brackets bonded with two different adhesive systems and also to evaluate enamel cracks after removing adhesive remnants and enamel polishing . \n sixty upper central incisors , extracted due to periodontal disease , were selected and stored in normal saline at room temperature until required . \n the study design was approved by the ethics committee of mashhad university of medical sciences . using a stereomicroscope ( blue light industry , waltham , ma , usa ) and digital camera ( exwave had , sony corporation , japan ) a magnified image ( 23.9x ) \n the number of enamel cracks and the length and direction of each crack were assessed with the aid of adobe photoshop cs software ( adobe systems incorporate , usa ) ( figure 1 ) . \n enamel cracks before bracket bonding ( a ) , after deboning ( b ) and after polishing ( c ) . \n new cracks are hatched . the number of visible cracks ( i.e. cracks visible to the naked eye ) was also recorded . \n the teeth were then randomly divided into two equal groups . in the first group , the buccal surface of each central incisor \n a standard edgewise twin metal bracket ( dentaurum , pforzheim , germany ) was bonded with transbond xt ( 3 m , usa ) to the center of the labial surface of each tooth . in the second group , \n the same bracket was bonded with self - adhesive composite cement ( maxcem elite , kerr , usa ) . in both groups , \n the adhesive was cured for 40 seconds ( 10 seconds on each side of the bracket ) . \n the teeth were then incubated in distilled water at 37c for 24 hours to allow the material to set . \n all the brackets were debonded with rmo i-546 remover pliers ( rmo , germany ) . \n the blades of the pliers were placed at the bracket - adhesive interface and a gentle squeezing force was applied to the pliers by a zwick / z250 at a speed of 0.5 mm / min until bond failure occurred . \n the present method of force application was modified from a diametric compression test for tension that indirectly measures tensile strength . \n this approach was used because it simulates the usual clinical method for applying debonding forces . \n the debonding force recorded by the zwick is not equal to the actual force applied at the bracket adhesive interface because the force was applied at a predetermined distance on the pliers beaks . \n these forces , however , are proportional and can be expressed in the following ratio : the actual force ( f ) equals the measured force ( f ) multiplied by ( a ) divided by ( b ) : f= f ( a / b ) . in this ratio , ( a ) \n is the distance from the point of force application to the fulcrum of the pliers and ( b ) is the distance from the point of actual force application to the fulcrum of the pliers . \n deboning force was measured in newton and was then converted to megapascal ( mpa ) . \n after debonding , the buccal surfaces of the teeth in each group were examined by the same stereomicroscope and the magnified images ( 23.9 x ) were taken with the same digital camera . the number of enamel cracks and the length and the direction of each crack were assessed with the aid of the same software . \n a : the distance from the point of force application to the fulcrum of the pliers . \n b : the distance from the point of actual force application to the fulcrum of the pliers the number of visible cracks in each tooth was also recorded ( figure 1 ) . \n the adhesive remnants on each tooth were then assessed with the ari in a 03 scale : 0 indciates no composite left on the tooth ;

    "input": "sensitive skin syndrome is a common and challenging condition , yet little is known about its underlying pathophysiology . \n sensitive skin is a common term used by patients and clinicians , as well as the cosmetic industry , and represents a complex clinical challenge faced by dermatologists and other skin care professionals . \n patients with sensitive skin often present with subjective complaints that are out of proportion to the objective clinical findings . \n the patients complain of severe facial irritation , burning , and/or stinging after application of cosmetic products and toiletries such as sunscreens and soaps , yet they do not demonstrate the clinical stigmata of scaling , induration , and/or erythema that would be expected in known inflammatory or allergic processes . \n the condition is often worsened by specific climatic conditions and may affect areas other than the face . \n maibach described the cosmetic intolerance syndrome ( cis ) , which probably covers the bulk of the clinical presentation of the sensitive skin syndrome ( sss ) . \n fisher is credited with coining the term status cosmeticus to describe one extreme of the natural history of the cis in which the patient gradually becomes completely intolerant to the application of any cosmetic product . \n fundamentally , sss is a state of hyperreactivity to environmental stimuli , presenting with a clear clinical picture and resulting from a single underlying pathology or a combination of pathologies . \n defined as a self - diagnosed condition , sss is by definition difficult to quantify . \n some of the contradictions between investigators could be explained by flawed methodologies since the scientific community has yet to identify an acceptable objective screening test for sensitive skin . \n however , it is not only the subjective nature of the complaints that make sss difficult to diagnose . \n robinson , by performing patch testing with sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) and looking for intra - individual response patterns , found that there is significant positive correlation between sds and other irritants but noted overall low correlation coefficients . \n he therefore deduced that it is inappropriate to define a subject 's reaction to a chemical based on his or her response to another irritant . \n she skin - tested 58 subjects with history of strong positive sds or lactic acid response . \n sds- or lactic acid - positive group , a reaction to one irritant could not predict a reaction with another . to further complicate matters \n there is evidence to suggest that no correlation exists between the lactic acid stinging test and the response to sds . \n this data resonate the idea that even the reference irritants commonly used in studies of this topic do not correlate with each other and with hyperreactivity tendencies . \n finally , judge tested 22 nonatopic adults with varying doses of sds and found marked inter - individual variation in the response threshold . \n this complexityreinforces the need for a thorough diagnostic algorithm and , specifically , the need to test patients with multiple , repeated and complete ( i.e. all cosmetics applied by the patient at home ) patch testing before making a diagnosis . \n in order to formulate a systematic clinical approach , the medical and cosmetic communities have attempted to characterize the condition . \n lacking an objective screening test , investigators resorted to epidemiological studies using patient surveys . in a large epidemiological study in the uk ( \n n = 2316 ) , a staggering 51.4% of women and 38.2% of men self - reported themselves as having sensitive skin . of note , \n interestingly , atopy did not appear to predict self - perceived sensitivity in the participating women . \n in addition , in the same study self - reports of sss symptoms were statistically over - represented in the  self - reported sensitive cohort compared to the  self - reported nonsensitive cohort . \n this finding validates the link between self - perception of sensitive skin and neurosensory discomfort . \n two recent studies in the us and europe made similar observations . in the us , \n females were significantly more concerned about sensitive skin than men ; however , no age or ethnic differences were found . \n the european study reported an overall sensitive skin prevalence of 38.4% and found no ethnic differences . \n the european study , once again , demonstrated that people who reported having sensitive skin were significantly more likely to experience sss symptoms . of note , \n both the american and european studies used large samples ( n = 994 and n = 4506 , respectively ) ; however , they were both limited by a phone survey methodology and the lack of any objective assessment . in light of the increased incidence of self - reported hypersensitivity in females , \n he compared the patch test responses of 384 patients to sds as the positive control and found increased reactivity in males compared to females . \n lammintausta tested seven males and seven females with sodium lauryl sulfate ( sls ) and then performed visual inspections , transepidermal water loss measurements , and dielectric water content measurements but like other investigators found no reactivity differences between males and females , adding to the overall controversy . \n female self - perception of sensitivity is consistently increased compared to that of males , yet when put through objective reactivity testing the trend is unclear . \n ethnic differences in skin reactivity have been explored through the years , leading to the clinical hypothesis that black skin is less reactive than caucasian skin , which is in turn less reactive than asian skin . however , an epidemiological telephone survey performed in the us ( n = 811 ) revealed similar incidence of self - reported sensitive skin across four major ethnic groups ( afro - americans , asians , euro- american , and hispanics ) . the incidence rate of 52% is comparable to the incidence found in the uk ( see above ) . \n the investigators did , however , find minimally statistically significant ethnic differences in the self - reported triggers and symptoms of sensitivity : afro - americans reacted less to environmental and alcoholic triggers ; hispanics reacted less to alcohol ; asians reacted more to wind , spices , and alcohol ; and euro - american reacted more to wind . in terms of symptomology , statistically significant increase in recurrent itching on the face was noted in the asian population , and fewer euro - american avoided certain cosmetics due to skin reactivity . \n these findings were supported in a critical literature review , which showed that the evidence supporting the ethnic difference hypothesis using objective tests rarely reaches statistical significance and is often biased by subjective endpoints . \n recent data looking into age - related differences in hyperreactivity are showing more consistent results . \n whorl performed patch testing with 34 irritants on 2776 patients and found that young patients were more reactive than old patients . \n robinson 's findings also corroboratedthe trend towards increased reactivity in the young subjects compared to the old subjects . \n the mechanism leading to the sss has been debated in the literature , but the leading hypothesis relates to increased stratum corneum permeability . \n there is a known inverse relationship between corneocyte size and stratum corneum thickness and the permeability of the skin , and changes in this mechanical barrier result in abnormal skin penetration by irritants . \n in addition , low levels of ceramides in the stratum corneum have been linked to increased severity of sls - induced irritant contact dermatitis , pointing toward barrier compromise in sensitive skin . \n seidenari linked self - reported hyperreactivity to decreased skin capacitance ( indicating decreased water content ) , objectively suggesting increased absorption of irritants by the sensitive - skin population . in the same study , \n increased erythema was objectively measured in hyperreacting subjects suggesting involvement of some baseline vascular component , and leading more recent investigators to propose the involvement of cutaneus sensory innervation in the pathogenesis of sss . \n as with many syndromes , the management scheme presented here emphasizes the diagnostic framework [ table 1 ] . \n the clinical approach to the sss demands a thorough process of eliminating obvious as well as more subtle diagnoses . \n once the diagnosis is made , deriving the appropriate treatment becomes a relatively simple task . \n note that since much of the mechanisms of sss are unknown , the clinician must be comfortable with a certain degree of ambiguity and uncertainty . underlying mechanisms of sensitive skin syndrome it is reasonable to organize the differential diagnosis by dividing sss into visible and invisible sss . \n some dermatoses that most clinicians find simp...",

while unilateral pneumothorax is relatively easily suspected from the patient 's medical history , physical and radiological findings , the diagnosis of bilateral pneumothorax is usually delayed . \n the presence of equally diminished breath sounds in both sides and the presence of a not deviated trachea often mislead clinicians and delay chest drain insertion which is usually performed after the transaction of chest ct . although sp is a relatively common condition , bpsp is a very rare clinical condition . \n lee et al . , in their study of the 616 patients with 807 episodes of psp , found that the incidence of bpsp was 1.6% ( 13 patients ) . in univariate regression analysis \n , patients with psp compared with patients with bpsp had significantly lower body weight , bmi , higher body height / body weight ratio and higher incidence of bilateral blebs / bullae seen in hrct of the lung . \n however , in multiple regression analysis , only bmi and the presence of bilateral blebs / bullae retained statistically significant importance . \n huang et al . found that only lower bmi and smoking were significantly associated with the formation of bpsp . in their study , the proportion of bilateral blebs / bullae seen in hrct was higher in the bpsp group than that in the psp group ( 63 vs 53% , respectively ) , but the difference was not statistically significant ( p = 0.724 ) . \n the present report describes a case of bpsp in an overweight patient showing that psp is an existing condition in patients with bmi value higher than the normal . \n generally , if an sp affects < 20% of one lung , observation is efficient ; the absorption rate of the air is 1.25% ( 5075 ml / day ) . \n if pneumothorax affects > 20% of the lung or if it increases during observation , chest tube drainage may be required . \n air leakage can be diminished in 5 h and in 48 h in 52 and 82% of patients with tube thoracostomies , respectively . in patients with bpsp , one side \n should always be drained regardless of the extent of pneumothorax , whereas the other side can be managed by simple observation depending on the extent of the air in the pleura space . \n prolonged air leakage is the most common indication for operation in the first episode of pneumothorax . today \n compared with open thoracotomy , this procedure provides visualization of the entire thoracic cavity by video and causes less postoperative pain . \n single - stage bilateral vats procedure for bpsp has been advocated as an elective procedure to avoid subsequent anesthetic and operative procedures and longer hospital stays . \n if any underlying pulmonary disease is detected during surgical treatment , the existence of pleural communications should be investigated and mediastinal pleura should be examined carefully . \n in addition , apical pleurodesis further reduces the risk of recurrence . in our case , \n the patient was successfully managed initially with a bilateral tube thoracostomy and finally with an elective bilateral vats procedure . in conclusion , bpsp is a rare clinical condition and usually develops in patients with low bmi and bilateral blebs / bullae . \n bpsp in overweight - obese patients is an existing condition and its early diagnosis requires high suspicion index . \n bpsp needs urgent assessment and management , followed by bilateral single - stage vats treatment as a safe and effective procedure . \n ",

    "input": "familial adenomatous polyposis   account for 1% of colorectal cancers , and provides a model of apc inactivation as an early genetic event for the approximately 80%85% of cancers that develop from sporadic polyps . \n colorectal cancers arising in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis can be largely prevented by polyp surveillance and prophylactic colectomy . \n total proctocolectomy with construction of a conventional ileostomy or ileoanal anastomosis with preparation of an ileal pouch , has various effects on the function of the terminal ileum and the intestinal bacterial flora . \n this may deteriorate cholesterol metabolism , as absorption of cholesterol in duodenum and jejunum requires micellar solubilization with bile acids , fatty acids , monoglycerides , and phospholipids . \n hypothetically , ileal - pouch - anal anastomosis and ileostomy patients might differ with regard to the presence of various fatty acids in feces and their relationship to other reflections of lipoprotein metabolism , but we found no previous study focusing upon this issue . \n dietary fatty acids are incorporated into blood and tissues , and the fatty acid composition in these tissues are often used as biomarkers of fat intake . \n furthermore , the fecal amount and composition of fatty acids reflect fat ingestion , intestinal fatty acid absorption , and the activity of colonic bacteria . \n although some of the discrepancies between studies may be due to the use of different methods to analyze fatty acids , differences in diet , or the fact that assessments have been performed in different body compartments , modifications in the metabolism of fatty acids have been suggested in cancer patients [ 5 , 6 ] . \n it is not clear at what steps in the multistage carcinogenesis process a possible distorted fatty acid metabolism occurs . \n notably , if such alterations occur in the development of carcinogenesis , this may affect the biological functions of essential fatty acids and their derivates . \n very little is known about fatty acid metabolism in familial adenomatous polyposis , although chemoprevention affecting the fatty acid derivates and the cyclooxygenase enzymes is often administered to familial adenomatous polyposis patients . \n deregulation of the cyclooxygenase-2 pathway appears to affect tumorigenesis via a number of distinct mechanisms : promoting tumour maintenance and progression , encouraging metastatic spread , and perhaps even participating in tumour initiation . \n cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 are the rate limiting enzymes in the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes . \n arachidonic acid is the main substrate for these enzymes , leading to the synthesis of prostaglandins which have growth promoting effects . substituting arachidonic acid with omega-3 fatty acids has been shown to lead to the production of less potent prostaglandins . \n since cyclooxygenase-2 is a fatty acid metabolising enzyme , the relationships between cyclooxygenase-2 and fatty acid composition of different tissues is of interest . \n colectomized familial adenomatous polyposis patients had a deviant fatty acid profile with high levels of arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid and low levels of linoleic acid and alpha - linolenic acid in serum phospholipids , which is in accordance with studies in patients with other types of cancers [ 5 , 1013 ] . \n in a previous familial adenomatous polyposis study , comparable treatment effects of a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor were observed on the fatty acid composition in serum phospholipids and duodenal lesions , presumably and most importantly the nonbeneficial effects involving essential fatty acids . \n the results describe the content of fatty acids in feces , and relate this to the proportions of fatty acids and levels of cyclooxygenase mrna expression in duodenal biopsies , diet , and levels of serum lipoproteins . because the effects of ileostomy construction may differ from that of ileal - pouch - anal anastomosis because of scarcity of the bacterial flora and different surface area of the terminal ileum , we did separate analyses for these two groups . \n previous familial adenomatous polyposis studies have focused upon faecal sterols and bile acids [ 1517 ] , but none has to the best of our knowledge analysed the content of fatty acids in feces , including very long chained fatty acids . \n data from the present study are taken from a randomized double - blind placebo - controlled intervention study with a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor [ 12 , 14 , 18 ] . \n the main aim was to compare the effect of rofecoxib treatment on duodenal lesions ( data in preparation ) . \n the present study comprises data from baseline for only the patients operated with ileal - pouch - anal anastomosis and ileostomy ( 77% of total study group ) . \n all of them had been colectomized , and duodenal lesions had been verified by endoscopy and histology . \n rikshospitalet university hospital is a highly specialized university hospital with national responsibilities in the area of complicated treatments , such as follow - ups on the norwegian familial adenomatous polyposis patients . \n inclusion criteria were verified familial adenomatous polyposis , colectomy , 1870 years of age , and documented duodenal lesions graded as spigelman i , ii , or iii and the largest adenoma10  mm . \n exclusion criteria were indications for surgical treatment , suspected or documented intestinal obstruction or stenosis , patients unwilling or unable to adhere to protocol , known cardiac failure requiring medical treatment , and pregnancy . \n as for the adenomas sampled , they were all assessed histologically as mild / moderate dysplasia , all below 10  mm and all flat , located in the descending part of the duodenum . \n samples of feces were transferred to tubes and mixed to make a homogeneous mass of which 100200  ul were used for lipid extraction by adding 50  ul butanol , 100  l h2o , 1  ml methanol , and 1  ml chloroform . \n after 10  min under n2 , the mixture was filtered and the filter washed   with 1  ml chloroform   + 1  ml chloroform / methanol ( 2  :  1 ) + 0.8  ml 0.73% nacl . after mixing for 15  s , \n the tubes were centrifuged for 30  min at 1000  g. the upper phase was discarded and the lower phase transferred to new tubes and evaporated under n2 at 65c using a heat block . \n then 0.4  ml 0.5  n naoh in methanol was added and the solution kept for 7  min at 100c under nitrogen . after cooling to room temperature , 0.5  ml 12% \n bf3 was added and the solution kept for 10  min at 100c under nitrogen . after cooling to room temperature , 1  ml heptan was added under nitrogen , and mixing for 30  s , 1 ml of saturated nacl solution was added . after mixing , \n the solution was centrifuged for 10  min at 1000  g , and the upper phase transferred to new tubes . \n finally , the heptan was evaporated and 300  l hexan added before continuing with the gas chromatography procedure referred to earlier . \n dietary intake was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire , designed to cover as much of the total habitual diet as possible . \n questions were related to habitual frequency of consumption and the amount of foods eaten during the last year . \n they were asked to identify their habitual choices of edible fats by pointing at specially prepared pictures , in order to increase the validity of the estimate of dietary fat . \n each biopsy was put into a tube containing 600  l trizol and immediately mixed on a mixermill ( retsch gmbh , germany ) . \n gene expression analyses were carried out on a 7900  ht real -

    "input": "local anesthesia and pain control is one of the most important elements of dentistry , and particularly prosthetic dentistry . \n according to the american dental association , fear of pain is the most important factor preventing patients from visiting their dentists . \n different kinds of fear related to previous clinical experience affect patients ' attitudes to local anesthesia or dentist20 . although local anesthesia techniques do not provide pain - free treatment , this pain is generally tolerable . \n pain can result from the mechanical trauma of needle introduction into the site of injection , or from the sudden distension of the tissues , resulting from a rapid discharge of the contents of the syringe . \n pain can also be caused by the stimulation of the first few drops of the local anaesthetic3,14 . \n contrary to prevalent ideas , needle penetration of tissue is not the primary reason for discomfort . \n volume and pressure of the local anesthetic being injected causes more distress and/or pain . administering local anesthetic injection may not only provoke anxiety in patients , but also in the dentist29 . despite that , administering local anesthesia by injection for pain relief is still the most common method used in dentistry . \n however , there are several ways to alleviate pain before dental procedures begin , or the often painful nature of the injection in local anesthesia . \n transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( tens)24 , use of intraoral lidocaine patch11 and computerized local anesthesia7 ( the wand ) are newly developed methods to alleviate the pain and anxiety of dental patients , as alternatives to conventional local anesthesia . \n the wand ( milestone scientific , livingston , nj ) is a computer - controlled local anesthesia delivery system that drives local anesthetic from a conventional local anesthetic cartridge through plastic microtubing into a plastic handle to which a luer - lok needle is attached . the computer - controlled flow is initiated by exerting pressure on a foot pedal . \n the pump allows administration of local anesthetic at two slow but constant rates , and the computer compensates for variation in resistance to flow4 . during needle insertion , continuous positive pressure delivers an anesthetic drip that precedes the needle . the combination of an anesthetic pathway and controlled flow rate results in a virtually imperceptible injection and rapid onset of profound anesthesia . \n the wand system offers several advantages over conventional syringes , including excellent tactile sensation afforded by a lightweight plastic handle and the ability to rotate the needle as it is introduced into tissues , producing a coring penetration that minimizes needle deflection . \n wand devices automatically deliver the anesthetic more slowly and precisely than a conventional syringe , thereby reducing patient discomfort5,15 . \n anesthetic solution gently pumped into the soft tissue can be absorbed at the same rate by soft tissue in the wand system . \n the theory is that when the needle is advanced slowly , the drops of solution anesthetize the tissue ahead of the needle . \n all techniques of local anesthesia , such as maxillary and mandibular infiltration , mandibular block22 , intraligamentary26 , and anterior middle superior alveolar ( amsa ) injection8 , and anterior superior alveolar ( asa ) injection25 can be performed with the wand system . \n conventionally , maxillary teeth have been anesthetized by administering an infiltration injection on the buccal or labial aspects of the target tooth . \n palatal injections have also been administered by plastic syringe for this objective , but can be painful5,7 . \n the amsa derives its name from the injection 's ability to anesthetize both the anterior and middle superior alveolar nerves57 . \n the middle superior alveolar ( msa ) and asa nerves branch from the infraorbital nerve before they exit from the infraorbital foramen . \n the msa nerve is thought to innervate the maxillary premolars and plays some role in pulpal innervation of the mesiobuccal root of the first molar . \n the anterior , superior alveolar nerve supplies pulpal innervation to the central and lateral incisors and canines18 . \n the plexus where the 2 nerves join is the target site for the amsa injection . \n the 10 maxillary teeth extending from the second premolar to contralateral second premolar , and the associated palatal tissue , can be anesthetised with bilateral amsa injection57 . \n wand research is largely attributable to pediatric dentistry1,2,9 , restorative dentistry7 , endodontics14 , periodontology17,26,27 , maxillofacial surgery16 , comparison of pain perception to the wand and a traditional syringe21,28 , influence of anesthetic flow rate delivered by the wand on pain response to the palatal injection23 . \n the hypothesis of the present study was that the wand anesthesia technique reduces the pain at different phases ( needle insertion , delivery of local anesthetic and tooth preparation ) versus conventional buccal anesthesia with conventional plastic syringe . \n therefore , the study compared pain levels at needle insertion , during delivery of local anesthetic solution and during tooth preparation , for the conventional syringe technique on the buccal or labial aspect on one side , and the amsa technique with wand local anesthesia application on the other side of the maxilla . a 5-point verbal pain rating scale ( vrs)12,17 was used on 16 patients who were under prosthodontic treatment in the ondokuz mayis university clinic \n sixteen adult patients who had partially edentulous states of both left and right maxillary arch , and were to undergo fixed prosthodontic treatment , participated in this study . \n they ranged in age from 27 to 64 , were predominantly women ( 12 women and 4 men ) , and were in a good health . \n patients were not taking any medication that would alter their pain perception , as determined by a written medical health form and oral questioning . \n allergy to lidocaine , mepivacaine , sulphides or articaine , history of significant medical problems , taking central nervous system depressants within 48 hours , pregnancy , or inability to give informed consent , were the exclusion criteria . \n the human subjects review committee of ondokuz mayis university approved this study ( 28.11.2005 dated , and 328 numbered ) , and written , informed consent was obtained from each patient . \n all patients had previously experienced a conventional syringe , no patients had previously received the wand injection , and all patients had at least one tooth absent both on the left and right maxillary arch . \n the amsa technique with the wand for half the maxillary arch and conventional plastic syringe anesthesia on mucobuccal fold ( control group ) for opposite maxillary arch were administered by the same operator . \n the order of anesthesia techniques was randomly selected , and anesthesia procedures and tooth preparations were completed in the same session ( table 1 ) . \n vrs ( 0 no pain , 1 minimal pain , 2 slight pain , 3 moderate pain and 4 severe pain ) . \n the pain level descriptions were as follows : no pain , minimal pain , slight pain , moderate pain and severe pain ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) . \n patients were blindfolded with a commonly used sleeping mask so they would not distinguish which anesthetic delivery system was used . \n the wand produces audible beeps as the injection is administered . because the beeping tones can not be turned off with a switch , the sound were produced during both injection methods ( the wand or conventional - control ) so the patients were not aware of the method being used . immediately after needle insertion , delivery of local anesthetic and tooth preparation , \n patients were asked to remove mask and rate the pain for both conventional and wand injection techniques . \n no topical anesthetic was used because the wand manufacturer 's instructions suggest that topical application is optional . \n this study was conducted according to a split- mouth design , with both injections given to all patients . for each patient , \n the amsa technique with single wand injection was used on one side for central incisors , lateral incisors , upper canine , first and second premolars , and the traditional plastic aspirating syringe injection was used on the mucobuccal fold of the related tooth on the opposite side \n . the amsa injection site is located at a point that bisects the maxillary first and second premolars , and midway between the crest of the free gingival margin and mid - palatine suture . \n the needle is orientated at a 45 degree angle with the bevel facing the palatal tissue , while rotating the wand needle . \n all injections were given by the same operator who had had two months experience using the wand at the department of prosthodontics , faculty of dentistry , ondokuz mayis university , turkey . \n the ampul form of articaine hy...",

based programs . \n it is well established that home - based pr programs are safe and effective [ 13 , 2931 ] and are recommended by many international guidelines and reviews [ 2 , 11 , 12 , 17 ] . given the effectiveness of independent home - based pr programs one could ask what additional benefits supervised remote - based programs would provide . \n the main advantage of supervised remote - based programs is the ability to minimise anxiety in both patient and therapist . \n this benefit has been shown in remote - based cardiac exercise programs where the use of transtelephonic exercise monitoring ( tem ) has been used to relieve patients ' and trainers ' anxiety during exercise [ 3234 ] . \n it is anticipated that a person with copd could exercise to a higher intensity without the risk of undetected adverse events ( e.g. , exercise - induced oxygen desaturation ) . \n telerehabilitation is an emerging technology used to facilitate the delivery of rehabilitation services at a distance by combining telecommunication and electronic transmission of health information . \n it has the potential to provide equitable access for people living in rural or remote areas where access to health service is limited . \n for telerehabilitation to be successful , however , there must be accurate assessment and outcome measurement tools available to therapists [ 37 , 38 ] . in pr , \n the pulse oximeter is a noninvasive device which continuously monitors a person 's peripheral blood oxygen saturation ( spo2 ) and heart rate ( hr ) . \n it is used clinically to measure a person 's exercise intensity and warn of exercise - induced desaturation . \n the concept of remote monitoring of physiological data including spo2 and hr for exercise rehabilitation purposes has received attention in the literature . \n as early as the mid-1980s , physicians were successful at remotely monitoring a patient 's electrocardiogram ( ecg ) through the analogue telephone network during a home - exercise program [ 40 , 41 ] . \n however , the majority of electronic healthcare literature on pr has focused on telemonitoring systems [ 4246 ] or consultations services [ 36 , 47 ] . \n there has been little research using e - health to deliver real - time , live supervision of patients for treatment purposes . \n this study aimed to develop and verify the use of a remote pulse oximetry system on healthy individuals . specifically , it aimed to establish the technical feasibility of transmitting pulse oximetry data remotely , to determine the validity of remote measurements when compared to conventional face to face measurements , and to evaluate the participants ' perception on the usability of the technology . \n it was hypothesised that remote pulse oximetry would not only be technically feasible but would also be valid when compared to conventional units and would be easy for participants to use . \n a favourable result will enable the development of remote pulmonary rehabilitation programs for people living in rural or remote areas . \n this study was reviewed and granted ethical clearance from the appropriate medical research ethics committee at the university of queensland . \n thirty - seven healthy individuals were recruited to participate in a single remote cardiopulmonary exercise session . \n the following exclusion criteria were applied : cardiovascular , respiratory , metabolic , or orthopaedic conditions that would prevent participation in an exercise program , chronic infectious diseases , pregnancy , and mental or physical impairment . \n the exercise session was conducted using the ehab telerehabilitation system ( v2.0 , uniquest , brisbane , australia ) which is a computer - based videoconferencing and remote consultation system . \n two ehab devices were used , one with the participant and the other with the therapist . \n the participant and therapist were located in separate rooms . the ehab device with the participant \n was configured to receive data from a bluetooth pulse oximeter module ( onyx ii 9560 , nonin medical inc . , plymouth , mn ) ( figure 1 ) . \n this information was transmitted by the participant device at a frequency of one hertz via an encrypted data channel to an offsite server via an active server page ( asp ) web service . \n the data was subsequently stored in a mysql database on the server . a therapist device retrieved this data via an asp web service to produce a graph of the participant 's heart rate and spo2 recordings in near real time . for this study \n the ehab telerehabilitation system utilised a local wi - fi network connection ; however , the connection speed was throttled to 128  kbit / s to ensure compatibility with the 3g / hsdpa mobile network available in remote areas of australia . \n after written consent was obtained , participants were taken to a room with the ehab device , remote pulse oximeter module , headset , and treadmill . \n they were asked to remove any nail polish from their index finger on the nondominant hand or jewellery which may disrupt accurate recordings . \n participants were given an information sheet with instructions on how to affix the pulse oximeter module to the index finger of their nondominant hand and how to establish a connection with a therapist in another room via the ehab device . \n once a videoconference was established , the therapist guided the participant through an exercise session . \n the modified borg score ( mbs )   was used to assess the participant 's exercise intensity . as per current copd exercise protocols \n the session began with a warm -

associated lipocalin ) is a 25  kda peptide , part of the lipocalin family of small soluble proteins . \n it is produced in a number of human tissues , notably the distal nephron but also in the lung   ngal rises rapidly in the nephron in response to a renal insult and an ngal 150  ng / ml following acute kidney injury ( aki ) is predictive of acute renal failure ( arf ) well before creatinine has risen . \n ngal is also an acute - phase protein , has a role in inflammation [ 8 , 9 ] , and is upregulated in the lung during inflammation [ 5 , 10 , 11 ] . \n ngal is also known to rise in conditions associated with oxidative stress [ 12 , 13 ] , and oxidative stress has been implicated in ams [ 14 , 15 ] . \n we therefore hypothesised that ngal would increase at ha secondary to these various stimuli and that the magnitude of any increase might relate to the presence of ams . \n we therefore studied a combined cohort of trekkers from 2 expeditions to ha . in order to clarify the relative contribution of ams , hypoxia or exercise to ngal levels \n , we also studied a cohort pre- and postexercise at near sea level , and a further cohort exposed to acute normobaric hypoxia . \n the potential role of inflammation in stimulating ngal was assessed by the measurement of highly sensitive c - reactive protein ( hscrp ) in a subset of participants . \n all study protocols were approved by the ministry of defence research ethics committee , whitehall , uk , and satisfied the requirements of the declaration of helsinki . in all studies informed , \n thirty - two subjects participating in a defence medical services ( dms ) trekking expedition ( trek 1 ) in the khumbu region of nepal were studied . \n blood samples were taken from the antecubital fossa at 3 study altitudes : on day 2 at 3400  m , day 6 at 4270  m , and day 10 at 5150  m ( following ascent to everest base camp at 5364  m ) . all samples in this study \n were collected immediately following a day trekking (  posttrek  ) to the study altitude . \n twenty subjects from a further dms expedition ( trek 2 ) to nepal were also studied . \n blood samples were again taken at 3 study altitudes : on day 2 ( 3400  m ) , day 6 ( 4270  m ) , and day 10 ( 5150  m ) ( following ascent to kala patthar ( kp ) , 5643  m ) . \n samples in this study were again collected immediately following a day trekking (  posttrek  ) . \n additional samples were taken at rest in kathmandu ( kat ) at 1300  m and at rest the next morning at the 3 study altitudes . \n as serving members of the military , all subjects were able to fulfil the fitness criteria of their relevant service . \n this broadly includes an age - adjusted ability to run 1.5 miles in under approximately 11 minutes and to perform an age - adjusted number of sits - ups and push - ups within two blocks of 2 minutes . \n fourteen subjects underwent a 3-hour exposure to normobaric hypoxia ( fio2 11.6% , equivalent to 4800  m altitude ) in a hypoxic chamber . \n this exposure included a 5-minute step test ( step height of 25  cm , 1 complete step every 2 seconds ) at 95 minutes . \n a group of 22 subjects had ngal assayed at rest and after exercise at sl in the uk following ascent from sea level to 1085  m over 6 hours ( an equivalent gain in altitude and duration of exercise similar to that experienced on a trekking day in nepal ) . \n two subjects from trek 2 were part of the sl exercise group , but data collection occurred several months apart . \n ngal was analysed in the field on a biosite triage point of care monitor ( alere ltd , stockport , uk ) using a triage ngal test kit . \n the triage ngal test is a point - of - care , fluorescence - based immunoassay used which gives a rapid ( 15 minutes ) quantitative measurement of ngal in a range from 60 to 1,300  ng / ml . \n oxygen saturation ( digitally on warm hands at rest ) was measured using a nellcor np-20 pulse oximeter ( covidian , ma , usa ) during trek 1 + 2 and in the hypoxic chamber study at the same time as blood samples were taken . during trek 1 + 2 , \n twice - daily ams scores were assessed using the lake louise score ( lls ) questionnaire . \n the lls allocates a score of 0 to 3 ( symptom not present to severe ) for symptoms of ams ( headache , gastrointestinal symptoms , fatigue / weakness , dizzy / light - headedness , and difficulty sleeping ) . \n a score of 3 or more in the presence of headache is consistent with ams , a score of 6 or more with severe ams . \n the commercially available , highly sensitive , immunoturbidimetric assay ( roche diagnostics ) was used to measure crp in trek 2 at the same time points as ngal . \n mg / l and a between - run coefficient of variation between 2.5 and 5.7% . for statistical calculations , \n the software package spss 14.0 was used . for subjects with a ngal below the limit of detection of the assay ( 60  ng / ml ) , \n a value of 60  ng / ml was assigned for the purposes of statistical analysis . \n all data were tested for gaussian distribution using the kolmogorov - smirnov test and shapiro wilks statistic .   for the analysis of dependent variables that were normally distributed , changes were tested by student 's paired t - test . for independent variables that were normally distributed , \n a within - subjects anova was performed to investigate any serial changes in ngal with ascent at rest and post - trek . a two - way mixed anova with either resting or after trek ngal at each study altitude as the within - subjects factor and the presence of ams ( according to the ll score at multiple altitudes ) as the between - subjects factor \n if the mauchly sphericity test was significant , then p values were expressed after multiplication by the greenhouse - geisser epsilon . \n correlation analyses for normally distributed data were performed by calculating the pearson coefficient of correlation . \n a p value < 0.05 ( two - sided ) was considered significant . as the ascent profile and route were closely matched in trek 1 and trek 2 , data were combined and analysed as a whole . taking medication ( acetazolamide , dexamethasone ) \n had no apparent effect on ngal values , and therefore these subjects ( n = 11 ) were not excluded from the analysis . \n demographic data for the field study ( trek 1 + 2 ) , the controls , and the hypoxic chamber study are shown in table 1 . in the 22 subjects ascending to 1085  m in the uk \n , there was no significant ( p = 0.084 ) rise in ngal following exercise : resting sl ngal was 64  11 ( ng / ml , mean  sd , range 60104 ) and postexercise ngal was 71  14 ( ng / ml , mean  sd , range 60100 ) . of the 52 subjects , \n spo2 ( % , mean  sem ) dropped from 97  2 at kat ( 1300  m ) to 84  5 and 79  7 at 4270 and 5150  m , respectively ( p < 0.001 ) . \n there was a moderate inverse correlation between ngal and spo2 at 5150  m ( r = 0.477 , p = 0.001 ) ( figure 1 ) with a weaker inverse correlation between ngal and spo2 at 4270  m ( r = 0.340 , p = 0.019 ) . \n within the subjects , anova demonstrated a significant change in ngal with ascent both at rest ( p = 0.007 ) and after trek ( p = 0.001 ) ( figure 2 ) . \n spo2 ( % , mean  sem ) dropped from 99  0.4 at baseline to a nadir of 79  5 ( p < 0.001 ) . despite an equivalent drop in spo2 to \n that seen in trek 1 + 2 , ngal ( ng / ml , mean  sd , range ) showed no change between baseline and 180 minutes : 63  26 ( 2980 ) versus 67  25 ( 2784 ) , p = 0.538 . in trek 2 , serum creatinine { mol / l , mean  sem , ( range ) , ( p value versus baseline at kat ) } was 78  2 ( 6395 ) at baseline ; at 3400 , 4270 and 5150  m it was 87  3 ( 72120 ) ( p = 0.001 ) ; 84  2 ( 72104 ) ( p < 0.001 ) ; and 94  5 ( 76142 ) ( p < 0.001 ) . \n according to their ll scores at the highest study altitude ( 5150  m ) , there were 23 subjects with no ams , 16 subjects with mild ams , and 7 subjects with severe ams . \n there was a significant difference between ngal depending on the presence or absence of ams at 5150  m ( figure 3 ) with higher values in those with ams and severe ams . a two -...",

    "input": "when deposited on various \n substrate surfaces , rod - like , -conjugated , \n small organic molecules are well - known for their tendency to form \n highly anisotropic crystal shapes , which are frequently called fibers \n or needles . whereas the epitaxial growth has been studied on various substrates , \n in particular anisotropic surfaces seem favorable to conserve the \n highly anistropic morphology and optical properties , for example , \n polarized emission or adsorption provided by a parallel molecular \n orientation obtained by self - assembly . consequently , \n cu(110 ) , tio2(110 ) and muscovite mica(001 ) are frequently chosen as a proper fundament to study the epitaxial \n growth of rod - like small molecules . in this paper , the epitaxial \n growth of 2,2:6,2-ternaphthalene \n ( nnn ) on muscovite mica(001 ) is reported . as indicated in figure 1a , \n the molecule is built from three naphthalene \n units , which are linked together by c \n the coexistence of needle - like structures \n and island - like crystallites is verified . \n structural analysis reveals \n two different crystal orientations . whereas island - like structures \n are built up by upright standing molecules orientated with a ( 001 ) \n contact plane relative to the muscovite mica substrate ( see figure 1b ) , \n needles consist of nnn molecules with a ( 111 ) \n lying orientation ( see figure 1c ) . \n both crystal \n configurations provide a well - defined azimuthal alignment , which is \n discussed based on force field simulations and a recently reported \n growth model . \n the azimuthal alignment \n of island like structures is explained by  ledge directed \n ( b ) a side view of nnn molecules packed in the observed crystal \n structure . each unit cell houses two nnn molecules . \n molecules are \n approximately standing on the s ( 001 ) contact plane , which is indicated \n in blue . \n ( c ) a side view along the long molecular axis visualizing \n the edge -

aromatic compound could be obtained in high yield by coupling \n 2 equiv of 2-naphthaleneboronic acid ( 1 ) with 1 equiv of 2,6-dibromonaphthalene \n ( 2 ) , as described in the supporting information . \n the final product , 2,2:6,2-ternaphthalene \n ( nnn ) , was obtained as a colorless product , which appears to be highly \n insoluble in common solvents and could only be recrystallized from \n 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene ( colorless platelets ) . \n the material was checked \n with gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy and found to be > 99% \n pure before thermal sublimation . \n all samples have \n been fabricated \n on muscovite mica(001 ) substrates ( spi , structure probe , inc . ) . \n muscovite \n mica is a representative of sheet silicate minerals and provides a \n layered structure of aluminum silicate sheets weakly bound by layers \n of potassium ions . \n each layer is characterized by a high symmetry \n direction identified by parallel aligned surface grooves . between \n the individual sheets , the high symmetry direction alternates by 120 \n leading to a periodic  stacking sequence \n along   direction . immediately after \n cleaving , the mica substrates were transferred to the hot wall epitaxy \n ( hwe ) chamber . \n the hwe technique was applied for the deposition \n of the organic material , which allows us to perform the growth process \n close to thermodynamic equilibrium , and in further consequence relatively \n high vapor pressure of the organic deposit in the substrate region \n can be achieved . therefore , the requirements concerning vacuum conditions \n are reduced compared with , for example , molecular beam epitaxy . \n the source material nnn was purified twice by \n thermal sublimation before filling it into the quartz tube of the \n hwe reactor . \n muscovite mica substrates were transferred into the deposition \n chamber via a load lock and subsequently preheated at the deposition \n temperature ( 80 c ) for 30 min to ensure a stable temperature \n during the whole deposition process . \n the deposition was performed \n thereafter under a base pressure of 9  10 mbar . \n optical microscope images \n have been acquired by a nikon labophot 2a microscope in combination \n with a nikon type 115 digital camera . \n scanning force microscopy ( sfm ) \n studies of the deposited organic films were performed using a digital \n instruments dimension 3100 in the tapping mode . \n the 10  10 m images have been acquired at scan speeds of 46 m / s \n using sic tips ( masch , hq : nsc15/al bs ) exhibiting a cone angle \n of 40. nominal values for resonance frequency and tip radius \n are 325 khz and 10 nm , respectively . \n x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) \n measurements were carried out on a philips xpert x - ray diffractometer \n using cr k radiation (  = 2.29  ) and a secondary \n graphite monochromator \n . please note that the monochromator is transparent \n for  , /2 , /3 , etc . \n , so despite the weak intensity \n of the bremsspektrum , it can give clear bragg peaks due to the scatting \n on the single crystalline mica substrate . \n specular scans were performed \n in bragg  brentano configuration by varying the z - component of the scattering vector q. consequently \n it is possible to detect lattice planes that are parallel to the sample \n surface . \n pole \n figures were acquired by measuring at a constant length of q and only varying its direction . \n the unit cell parameters of nnn , \n which were used for analysis , are defined by a = \n 8.148  0.005  , b = 5.978  0.005 \n  , c = 19.45  0.2  , and  \n = 94.6  0.2 describing a monoclinic lattice ( p21/a ) . the \n unit houses two nnn molecules in planar configuration . \n the van der waals ( vdw ) interaction \n between the organic molecule and the dielectric substrate is modeled \n by lennard - jones - type potentials . \n corresponding parameters are taken \n from the universal force field implemented \n in a matlab program . \n the molecules and substrates are assumed to be \n rigid where the internal structure of an isolated nnn molecules is \n determined from the crystal structure . \n simulations were performed for the adsorption of a single nnn molecule \n as well as a crystal stack . by assuming that a single nnn molecule \n prefers to lie flat on the surface , the energy minimization procedure \n is simplified in the following way : we consider only four molecular \n degrees of freedom , the x- , y- \n , \n and z - positions of the molecular center of mass and \n the angle . the angle  defines the azimuthal molecular \n alignment and is probed by rotating the nnn molecule around the z - axis ( surface normal ) . we perform a grid - based optimization \n to search for the best molecular adsorption geometry using a grid \n of 81  81 points for the lateral position . \n the adsorption angle was tested \n with a step size of  = 1. the surface structure \n of the substrate has been assumed to be the same as in the bulk where \n the corrugation is about 0.2  . the substrate surface is assumed \n to be terminated by the tetrahedral layer of muscovite mica . \n for the \n simulation of the 7  2 nnn stack , the molecular packing has \n been deduced from the crystal structure of a ( 111 ) orientated nnn crystallite . due to the presence of flat \n and edge - on molecules , \n the adsorption distance has been optimized , \n yielding a distance of 1.6  of the lowest h atom of edge - on \n nnn molecules to the substrate surface . because energetic minima are \n significantly narrow for the molecular stack , an angular resolution \n of  = 0.5 has been chosen for the calculations . \n in a first \n step , nnn was deposited by hot wall epitaxy ( hwe ) on muscovite mica(001 ) . \n whereas the substrate temperature was kept constant at 80 c , \n the deposition time was continuously increased . \n scanning force microscopy \n was chosen to study the sample morphology versus deposition time , \n and obtained images ( 10  10 m ) are depicted \n in figure 2 . as the maximum height scale z0 significantly changes with increasing deposition \n time , the corresponding values are indicated for each sample . \n the \n morphology of all samples is dominated by the presence of several \n micrometer long needle like structures that are aligned along multiple \n orientations . as exemplified by the cross - section ( 1 ) , \n these fibers \n reach height levels up to 200 nm and are characterized by \n similar dimensions in width . \n a more detailed analysis is provided \n in figure 2a , plotting the mean needle height \n versus growth time . as indicated by the solid line \n , the growth rate \n can be approximated by a linear fit , yielding a slope of 17.8 \n  1.2 nmmin . \n interestingly , the fibers \n surface coverage is approximately constant for the whole sample series \n yielding a value of 12.5% . \n the sfm analysis reveals \n that flat islands start to nucleate at the side wal...",

    "input": "dual - polymerizing resin cements have been extensively used for placement of indirect restorations and posts . \n the dual - polymerizing materials were developed to compensate for the lack of polymerization in the absence of light and to represent a combination of auto- and light - polymerizing components . in some clinical situations , such as in dark zones at the apical region and during the cementation of indirect restorations , the severe light attenuation results in low degree of conversion ( dc ) , which can compromise the mechanical properties and consequently the longevity of the indirect restorations.14 modifications in the viscosity of the resin cements allow their use in different clinical situations . \n the option for low viscosity versions offer some benefits , such as minor thickness of the pellicle that was formed following the restoration placement . \n the lowest film thickness generates smaller polymerization shrinkage , reducing the possibility of gaps formation and premature marginal leakage.5,6 the difference in the cement formulations that change the viscosity is related to the proportion between resin matrix and filler particle content.7 high volume fraction of fillers can increase the viscosity and the elastic modulus and strength of composites.7,8 low viscosity or flowable resins and resin cements present lower filler loading than regular restorative materials . \n most direct dental restorative composites use bisphenol - a - diglycidylether dimethacrylate ( bis - gma ) , which is considered a very viscous monomer , and when mixed with higher filler loadings , it becomes a nearly solid mass and unusable product . \n vinyl groups ( e.g. , ethylene glycol dimethacrylate ) are added as a thinner or diluent monomer for uncured pastes , which are considered another approach to change the viscosity of resin - based materials . \n the filler loading and the viscosity of composites may interfere in the monomer conversion , since they could restrict the mobility of monomers and the propagation of polymerization reaction.7,911 the restorative resin - based materials must reach a high degree of monomer conversion in order to present better clinical performance and longevity and also to reduce the early failures . for the dual - polymerizing resin cements \n , the self - cure mode should ensure the high level of conversion , especially in the cervical proximal areas , the root canal and in the internal and deep areas of the cavity preparations.1214 several methodologies have been used to analyze the dc of resin - based materials ; however , most of them use fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ( ftir ) . although many researchers have evaluated the polymerization effectiveness to determine the physical and mechanical properties of dental materials,9,15,16 little information is known about the influence of different viscosities of dual - cured resin cements on their physical properties , such as the degree of conversion in situations of self - and dual - polymerization . \n thus , the purpose of this study was to measure the dc of two commercially dual - cured resin cements in different viscosities ( low and high ) when they were light - activated or when the materials were allowed to self - cure solely , after 5 minutes and 24 hours from the mixture of pastes ( base and catalyst ) . \n the hypothesis tested was that curing mode , evaluation time and viscosity would affect the dc of the resin cements . \n two commercial dual -

ir spectrometer 520 , nicolet instrument corp , madson , wi , usa ) at room temperature . \n adhesive tape ( 3 m , sumar , sp , brazil ) was placed on the znse crystal surface to act as a spacer , ensuring standard thickness for all specimens ( 100120 mm ) . a mylar strip ( quimidrol com . \n ltda , joinville , sc , brazil ) was placed over the cement and was pressed flat to spread the material on the crystal surface . \n the spectrum of unpolymerized material was obtained and the cements were either light - cured ( dual - polymerizing mode ) or allowed to self - cure only ( autopolymerizing mode ) . \n each specimen was left on the crystal surface and further spectra were obtained 5 minutes and 24 hours after post mixing . for light - cured groups , a halogen light curing unit ( xl 3000 , 3 m espe , st . \n paul , mn , usa ) was used during 40 seconds (  600 mw / cm ) . \n the light intensity was periodically checked with a radiometer ( curing radiometer , model 100 , kerr corp . , orange , ca , usa ) . \n spectra were obtained between 4000 cm and 750 cm at a resolution of 4 cm . \n monomer conversion was calculated ( % ) according to the changes in the ratio between the absorbance peaks corresponding to the aliphatic ( cc ) ( 1638 cm ) and aromatic ( 1608 cm ) carbon double bonds prior to and 5 minutes and 24 hours after polymerization initiation for both curing modes.10 the aromatic peak is used as an internal reference because the intensity does not change during the polymerization reaction.9,11 the effect of curing mode , viscosity and time intervals on the dc were evaluated for each material . \n three - way repeated measure analysis of variance ( anova ) ( curing mode , viscosities and evaluation time ) was performed and tukey s post - hoc test was used to detect pair wise differences among experimental groups . \n the data was analyzed using the statistical program sas 9.1 ( sas institute , cary , nc , usa ) and all statistical testing was performed at a pre - set alpha of 0.05 ( p<.05 ) . \n the statistical analysis of the data showed significant differences in curing mode , viscosity and evaluation time factors for both resin cements ( p=.01 ) . \n there was significant interaction between factors : the curing mode x evaluation time ( p=.01 ) . \n other double - interactions and the triple - interaction ( curing mode x viscosity x evaluation time ) were not significant ( p>.05 ) . \n the dc of resin cements was higher when the materials were light - cured and when the low - viscosity versions were used than when self - curing mode and the high - viscosity resin cements were tested , respectively ( p<.05 ) . \n the results of this study showed that the curing mode ( auto- and dual - polymerization ) , the viscosity ( low or high ) and the evaluation time ( 5 minutes or 24 hours ) influenced the dc of resin cements . \n thus , the research hypothesis stating that these factors would result in significant changes in the dc was accepted . as the dc is dependent on the monomeric composition and the concentration and type of the photoinitiator in each product,9,17 the statistical analysis comparing the dc between resin cements \n the main factors under study ( curing mode , viscosities and time intervals ) produced similar effects for the resin cements , which presented different formulations regarding the resin matrix composition and type and concentration of filler particles . the variations on the proportion of components of resin matrix and filler particles that produced the low and the high versions caused no difference in behavior between the two cements results.7 a high monomer conversion with cross - linked polymeric network formation is essential for the durability of the resin - based restorations.911 studies have shown the importance of a high dc of resinous materials in order to reach better mechanical properties , since the presence of a high amount of residual methacrylate monomers compromises the hardness , the abrasion and the fracture resistance . moreover \n , the low dc can increase the sorption and the solubility , interfering in the color stability and mass loss of the resin cement.2,4,9,14,1720 the resin cements showed significant difference between the evaluation times , 5 minutes and 24 hours from the polymerization initiation , independently of viscosity or curing mode . \n thus , the polymerization reaction for both resin cements continued after 5 minutes of the mixing of the base and catalyst pastes . \n the continuation of the chemical part of the polymerization reaction ( benzoyl peroxide + tertiary amines ) was primarily responsible for the increase of the dc after 24 hours . \n additionally , the percentage of dc increasing after 24 hours was higher for the self - cure mode than the dual cure mode , which ranged from 38.3 to 42.4% and from 26.6 to 28.4% , respectively . the continuation reaction 24 hours after polymerization initiation resulted in a reduction of absorbance peaks that corresponded to the aliphatic...",

[ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] this entity is very challenging to treat even for the most skilled and experienced surgeons [ 7 , 8 , 10 ] . \n the femur is the most frequent fracture site , followed by the patella and the tibia [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . \n patella fracture after tka can occur after trauma , or result from a stress fracture due to patella osteonecrosis , which is the most common cause of this type of fracture [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 11 ] . \n chalidis et al ( 2007 ) have reported in a systematic review of a 752 periprosthetic patella fracture that in 88.3% of the cases , the fracture was not associated with a traumatic event , asymptomatic , and discovered during routine follow - up . \n many risk factors of these stress fractures have been described in the previous literature [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ] including : \n poor blood supply for patella after tka especially for antero - medial approach , and in case of lateral release or unwarranted fat pad removal : knee replacement surgery is likely to cause disruption of the vascular peri- patellar network especially the medial and the superior lateral genicular arteries.mal-alignment of the femoral and tibial implantspatella resurfacing arthroplastiesan excessive ( thickness < 15 mm ) or asymmetric bone resection during patella resurfacingosteonecrosis due to bone cement polymerization : the heat of polymerization of the polymethylmethacrylate may exceed the coagulation temperature , causing thermal necrosis of the bonethe use of large central fixation peg designs for patellar implant , instead of small peripheral peg design.revision surgeryosteoporosis and bone losshyperflexion of the kneerhumatod arthritis \n  poor blood supply for patella after tka especially for antero - medial approach , and in case of lateral release or unwarranted fat pad removal : knee replacement surgery is likely to cause disruption of the vascular peri- patellar network especially the medial and the superior lateral genicular arteries . mal - alignment of the femoral and tibial implants patella resurfacing arthroplasties an excessive ( thickness < 15 mm ) or asymmetric bone resection during patella resurfacing osteonecrosis due to bone cement polymerization : the heat of polymerization of the polymethylmethacrylate may exceed the coagulation temperature , causing thermal necrosis of the bone the use of large central fixation peg designs for patellar implant , instead of small peripheral peg design . osteoporosis and bone loss hyperflexion of the knee open patellar fracture above a total knee arthroplasty is a very uncommon injury , and challenging to treat . to our knowledge , \n reported a unique case of patellar fracture associated with open knee dislocation after a total knee arthroplasty . \n it was treated with open reduction and internal fixation of the patella with band tension wiring . \n greco et al , reported an open tibial shaft fracture below an ipsilateral tka , managed with intramedullary nailing . \n some factors should be considered to succeed in the management of this type of fracture such as displacement of the fracture , function of the extensor mechanism , stability of the patellar implant , remaining bone stock [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 ] . \n it includes immobilization by a brace locked in full extension or a cylinder cast in case of non - operative treatment ; open reduction and internal fixation , implant revision in case of loosening , partial or total patellectomy , repair of the quadriceps tendon or patellar ligament in case of surgical treatment [ 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 ] . the periprosthetic patellar fractures are usually managed by a non - operative treatment especially for type i and ii , because of the high infectious risk of open reduction and internal fixation [ 13 , 14 ] , and consequently a high risk of arthroplasty failure . \n literature analysis showed that conservative or non - operative treatment was more successful for t...",

intrinsic properties and identity cues received and provided by each cell to its neighboring cells then shapes the cell - to - cell cross talk during physiopathological conditions . in the cns , neuroinflammation is the typical consequence of the interchange among different cell types , particularly neurons , astrocytes , oligodendrocytes and microglia , of a variety of cues as neurotransmitters , cytokines , chemokines , toxic metabolites that condition the final protein / mrna profiles of cells , their activation states and functional outcomes [ 2 , 3 ] . \n since neuroinflammation accompanies a large variety of neurodegenerative diseases , there is increasing interest in determining how the different cell phenotypes and cellular interconnectivity might contribute to reduce inflammation and reverse neurodegeneration . \n microglia actively participate to the context - dependent , neuroprotective / neurotoxic molecular network that is triggered during neuroinflammation . among the molecular cues having a key role in this process , \n extracellular nucleotides are major responsible for intercellular communication and propagation of inflammatory stimuli [ 57 ] . \n this occurs by specific binding to various receptor subtypes , termed ionotropic p2x and metabotropic p2y , which are simultaneously localized on several different cell phenotypes . among these \n , the p2y12 receptor subtype   belonging to the gi class of g protein - coupled receptors is activated by adp . \n two transcript variants apparently encoding the same protein isoform have been identified so far for p2ry12 gene , but the determinants for cell specificity of p2y12 protein expression are still unknown . \n p2y12 is found on the surface mainly , but not exclusively , of blood platelets , where it acts as blood clotting regulator and target for the treatment of thromboembolisms [ 9 , 10 ] . in the nervous system , \n the tissue- and cellular - selective expression of p2y12 exhibits a pattern throughout white and gray matter consistent with astrocyte expression , although it has not been found colocalization between p2y12 and gfap - positive astrocytes in rat brain cortex and nucleus accumbens , despite the abundant presence of p2y12 mrna . \n moreover , we previously established in vivo the expression of p2y12 in oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths of rat cerebral cortex , subcortical areas , and periventricular white matter . this localization is confirmed throughout the corticospinal tract , therefore suggesting high conserved tissue - homogeneity and phenotype - specificity , and a hypothesized role in myelination [ 1215 ] . \n p2y12 is finally observed in brain and spinal cord resident microglia , where it affects activation , chemotaxis [ 1619 ] and neuropathic pain , but it is not observed , for example , in peripheral macrophages in spleen [ 18 , 20 ] . \n p2y12 expression in primary microglia is variable with postnatal development and shows sexually dimorphic behavior . through the use of all the available p2y12-immunoreactive antibodies recognizing the c - terminus or the second intracellular loop of the receptor , the aim of the present work is to provide comparative evidence about p2y12 cell specificity in microglia versus oligodendrocytes particularly from the healthy and diseased cns under neuroinflammatory conditions as those sustained during amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) and multiple sclerosis ( ms ) . \n adult b6.cg-tg ( sod1-g93a)1gur / j mice expressing high copy number of mutant human sod1 with a gly93ala substitution ( sod1-g93a ) were originally obtained from jackson laboratories ( bar harbor , me , usa ) and housed in our indoor animal facility as described in apolloni and collaborators , . \n the animals were euthanized , according to the guidelines for preclinical testing and colony management . \n also neonatal wistar and adult lewis rats ( from charles river laboratories , lc , italy ) were housed in our indoor animal facility . \n animal procedures were performed according to european guidelines for the use of animals in research ( 86/609/cee ) and the requirements of italian laws ( d.l . \n ethical procedures were approved by animal welfare office , department of public health and veterinary , nutrition and food safety , general management of animal care and veterinary drugs of the italian ministry of health . \n all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and number of animals necessary to produce reliable results . \n microglia primary cultures prepared from mouse cortex as previously described   were about 98% pure , as verified by immunofluorescence with cd11b ( for microglia ) , glial fibrillary acidic protein ( gfap , for astrocytes ) , neuronal nuclei ( neun , for neurons ) , and smi94 ( for oligodendrocytes ) . \n purified cultures of oligodendrocytes were prepared from forebrain of postnatal day 1 -

    "input": "acute kidney injury ( aki ) requiring dialysis is a serious complication in critically ill patients , bringing increased morbidity , mortality , and costs of care [ 14 ] . \n aki requiring dialysis is usually considered the most severe form of kidney injury , and these patients have been conventionally regarded as a relatively  homogenous  group of patients , either when describing epidemiological information or while conducting clinical trials [ 5 , 6 ] . \n however , studies examining interventions in dialysis patients ( e.g. , dialysis modality or frequency have not demonstrated unequivocal survival benefits [ 79 ] . \n it is well recognized that small changes in creatinine ( mild - to - moderate aki ) independently predict mortality [ 10 , 11 ] ; we also recently reported that patients with aki requiring dialysis represent a wider spectrum of severity of kidney injury , contrary to the prevalent notion . \n thus , it can be hypothesized that the degree of elevation of creatinine prior to initiating dialysis may discriminate risk - adjusted mortality , similar to the observations in nondialysis requiring aki . \n the acute kidney injury network ( akin ) has issued standard definitions of aki ; currently , in these criteria , aki requiring dialysis is classified as stage iii ( or severe ) aki . \n the consensus panel also proposed that the examination of natural history of severe aki in icu to be one of the high - priority research areas , with a goal that new information may improve our ability in conducting prospective trials of intervention aki [ 14 , 15 ] . to date , there are limited studies that have examined the course or progression of aki after icu admission until the point of dialysis initiation . whether the degree of severity of kidney injury prior to dialysis requirement independently influences mortality risk in aki is not known .   in order to facilitate risk stratification that may be useful for the development of prospective studies , which are geared towards early diagnosis or intervention in severe aki \n , we characterized the spectrum of severity of kidney injury in a cohort of icu patients with aki who required dialysis . \n we specifically tested the association of creatinine elevation during icu stay , starting with icu admission and prior to dialysis initiation , with the risk of hospital mortality . \n we also examined the impact of severity of illness upon icu admission on the mortality risk in these patients . \n we examined a cohort derived from the veterans affairs ( va ) inpatient evaluation center ( ipec ) ; a national quality improvement program which reports risk - adjusted mortality , length of stay , and adherence to evidence - based practices in all va icus , by collecting data electronically from va computer databases . \n an analytic dataset was formed from the ipec retrospective cohort including all patients ( n , 617,927 ) admitted to all 191 va icus in the usa between october 2001 and september 2006 . \n we excluded patients with ( i ) less than three creatinine measurements during the icu stay ( n , 204,963 ) , ( ii ) readmissions to the icu ( n , 50,874 ) , ( iii ) transferred to other hospitals at discharge ( n , 14,219 ) , ( iv ) transplant recipients ( n , 317 ) , and ( v ) those with chronic renal failure defined as prior dialysis ( n , 3,862 patients ) , or international classification of disease-9th  clinical modification ( icd-9-cm ) codes for end - stage renal disease ( esrd ; 1,388 patients 585.6 ) , or with a calculated glomerular filtration rate ( gfr ) < 15  ml / min/1.73  m ( 16,571 ) ( gfr estimated by four variable modified diet in renal disease equation ) ; 296 additional patients who required dialysis in icu but had icd-9 codes for advanced ckd / stage v ckd were also excluded ( based on random q / a , these codes identified esrd status in those who required dialysis ) . thus , 324,999 patients were available for analysis . \n the analyses were reviewed and approved by the university of cincinnati institutional review board and va r&d committees . \n briefly , from each hospital database , a customized program identifies patients whose hospitalization included an icu stay , and extracts administrative data from the index hospitalization that includes icd-9-cm codes representing the reason for admission to the icu , length of stay , and all procedure codes . measured values of 11 laboratory tests are extracted to estimate severity of illness from a period of time 7 days prior to icu admission through hospital discharge . \n mortality is defined at death during hospitalization and is validated using the vital status file at the va national database ( austin , tx ) . \n aki was present if there was an increment of serum creatinine by > 0.3  mg / dl ( or 1.5 times increase ) during the icu stay relative to the creatinine on icu admission . \n for this analysis , we specifically focused on examining characteristics and outcomes of those aki patients who progressed to new requirement of dialysis ( aki - d ) during icu stay ( part of stage iii aki according to the akin classification system ) . \n dialysis requirement in icu included both intermittent and continuous dialysis , as prescribed by the clinician , and the modality can not be differentiated based on va electronic records that were available . \n we categorized aki - d into four groups based on the change in creatinine level after icu admission but prior to initiation of dialysis : group i had an increase in creatinine ranging from 0.3  mg / dl to < 2-fold increase , group ii an increase in creatinine 2 times baseline but <3 times , group iii 3-fold increase in creatinine , and group iv included those patients with new dialysis requirement in icu but who experienced a creatinine elevation of < 0.3  mg / dl . \n the purpose of this grouping was to determine an equivalent stage of aki that a patient may experience prior to initiating dialysis based on the standard definitions of aki put forth by the akin . \n some patients may have had creatinine values available after dialysis initiation , but these values were not considered for analysis . \n the study accounts for differences in patient characteristics using a previously validated logistic regression model that predicts mortality risk for each patient from independent predictors ( age , thirty - one comorbid disease groups ( by icd-9-cm codes ) , eighty - four mutually exclusive admission diagnoses determined from the icd-9-cm codes denoting the reason for admission to the icu , source of admission ( emergency room , outpatient clinics , ward , hospital , operating room , or nursing home ) , and the worst value of each of the 11 laboratory tests measured within 24 hours of icu admission ( sodium , urea , creatinine , bilirubin , albumin , glucose , hematocrit , white blood cell count , pao2 , paco2 , and ph ) . \n diagnosis and comorbid diseases were included in this model as binary variables , most laboratory values and age were included as cubic splines , and paco2 and ph were treated as a categorical interaction term . \n the model has been validated across multiple centers with excellent calibration and discrimination ( c - statistic = 0.88 ; brier 's = 0.06 ) , and comparable with traditional methods of severity of illness assessment ( e.g. , apache ) . from the logistic regression model , a standardized mortality rate for groups \n can be determined ( smr = observed / predicted mortality ; where predicted mortality is estimated by the mortality model described above ) . \n a more detailed account of development and validation of these variables and risk adjustment methods has been published earlier [ 16 , 19 , 20 ] . \n univariate comparison of diagnosis categories , comorbid diseases , and their relationship with laboratory variables was tested by chi - square test and kruskal - wallis test . \n a two - step logistic regression model determined the independent contribution of patient groups ( based on creatinine elevation ) to hospital mortality . \n the first step predicted each individual patient 's hospital mortality using the validated method described above . \n independent predictors in the second step included the predicted mortality ( determined from the first step ) and the patient group based on creatinine elevation before dialysis . \n based on the predicted mortality , as determined by the mortality model described above , we also estimated the standardized mortality rate ( observed / expected mortality ) for each of the patient groups under consideration . \n risk estimates were expressed as odds ratios ( or ) and 95% confidence intervals ( 95% ci ) . \n overall , 21.9% of patients developed aki ( 71,090/324,999 ) of whom 2,744 patients experienced severe aki requiring dialysis . \n 561/2744 ( 20.4% ) patients were admitted to icu from the hospital floors , whereas 2,183/2,744 ( 79.6% ) were either direct admission or admissions from emergency rooms . \n the median time for aki...",

however , the provision of high - quality psychiatric services remains a major concern in many countries . \n . evidently , the current psychiatric services in japan are not adequate to meet the complex mental health needs of people with i d appropriately , sensitively , and effectively . \n failure to provide services that meet the needs of these individuals may lead to problems such as high - level caregiver stress and inappropriate therapy . \n the paucity of trained psychiatrists and other allied professionals is a major barrier to the development of this subspecialty in many countries . in japan , \n high - quality psychiatric services for the parents of children with i d are assumed to be not well established . \n so far , the major portion of resources has been directed to the treatment of and services connected with the children , and not enough attention has been paid to the actual mental condition and needs of the parents . to our knowledge , there have been no reports on a nationwide scale on the mental health and distress of parents having children with developmental disabilities in japan . since the understanding of the parents ' \n mental health may be essential for providing more appropriate support , we aimed to obtain a clear perspective on the situation facing the parents through this facility - based nationwide study . \n the current survey included 1,102 institutions and consultation centers for children with developmental disabilities distributing in all prefectures in japan , which were listed in the national register of agencies , organizations , and institutions related to intellectual disabilities   and the directory of support centers for individuals with developmental disabilities . \n in japan , these institutions and centers play a key role in social support networks . \n professional workers in these facilities come into contact with children as their clients , and also with the children 's guardians , mainly with the mothers , on a daily basis . \n the questionnaire was written in japanese and was divided into two sections with a total of 47 multiple choice questions . \n the first section sought information about the characteristics of the facility , such as staff adequacy , the scale of the facility , the health promotion services provided , the ages of their clients , and the clients ' main disabilities , namely , i d , pervasive developmental disorder ( pdd ) , profound intellectual and multiple disabilities ( pimd ) , physical disabilities , and others . \n the second section sought information about the clients ' parents , such as signs of mental health distress and their needs , from the professional caregivers ' point of view . \n also measures taken by the professional caregivers when encountering distressed parents were asked in detail . \n questionnaires were mailed in october 2008 , with an explanatory letter to the person in charge of each institution or consultation center . when agreement was met to participate in this study , one or more service providers in each facility completed the questionnaire based on all sources of information available . \n the questionnaire was to be returned unsigned , using the stamped , self - addressed envelope enclosed . for ethical considerations , the information disclosed in the questionnaire was in a form which made it impossible to identify the facility and clients \n this study was approved and carried out under the supervision of the japan league on developmental disabilities ( jidd ) . \n the statistical analysis including the chi - squared test was performed with the aid of the statistical package for the social sciences 15.0 ( spss japan , inc . ) . \n a two - sided p value of 0.05 or less was considered to be statistically significant . answers to open - ended questions \n a total of 460 out of 1,102 facilities replied within four weeks , the response rate being 41.7% . according to the clients ' main disabilities , \n each facility was classified into the following categories : i d , pdd , pimd , physical disability group , and others ( table 1 ) . \n the last group was small in number and diverse in character and also included responders who provided incomplete information ; thus , data from this group were omitted from analysis hereafter . \n also in table 1 , the number of clients ( mean persons per facility ) as an index of facility scale , their mean age , and proportion of male gender are shown . \n their average age ( sd ) was 44.7 ( 9.5 ) years old for the i d group , 53.0 ( 7.6 ) for the pdd group , 48.3 ( 8.4 ) for the pimd group , and 55.3 ( 4.9 ) for the physical disability group . \n 373 out of the 415 facilities ( about 90% ) experienced cases with difficulties when communicating with the clients ' parents . \n the percentage was high regardless of the children 's disabilities , being concretely highest in the pdd group ( 96.9% ) and lowest in the physical disability group ( 86.7% ) . \n the proportion of such parents , out of the total , was reported to be  almost none  ( 5% or less ) or  few  ( less than one fourth of the clients ) in most of the facilities ( table 2 ) . \n it should be noted that in the i d and pdd groups , about 15% of the facilities responded that  about half  or more of the parents were difficult to communicate with . in all groups , \n the characteristics of the i d and pdd groups were similar to each other , while the pimd and physical disability groups resembled each other . \n in other words , in the i d and pdd groups , slightly more difficulties were experienced with the fathers compared to in the pimd and physical disability groups , where they experienced more difficulties with other family members such as the grandparents and siblings compared to the i d and pdd groups . \n the primary reason for these difficulties was thought to be the parent 's personal condition , such as poor mental health ( table 2 ) . \n this was especially true for the i d and pdd groups [ (df = 9 ) = 41.9 , p < 0.001 ] . in the pimd and physical disability groups , \n the parent 's poor socio - economic status and heavy care - giving burden , reflecting the child 's level of disability , were considered to be major factors in approximately one - third of the cases . \n signs of depression or a depressive state were the most common psychiatric disturbances seen in the parents . among the four groups , the pdd group most commonly experienced cases which showed signs of depression or a depressive state in parents . \n the proportion of such parents was approximately 70% of the total [ (df = 12 ) = 65.1 , p < 0.001 ] . \n well - treated cases were only 5% out of the total ; thus , most of these conditions were considered to be not medically well treated . \n for further analysis , we selected 159 cases where symptoms of depression or a depressive state were reported in a descriptive manner . according to these reports , \n we asked about the time of the onset , that is , whether it was prior to the birth of the child , when the parent first noticed the child 's disability , or after the child had been fully medically diagnosed . apart from the answer \n unknown  which accounted for approximately half of the cases ,  prior to the birth of the child  was relatively common in the pdd group ( 22.1% ) , whereas \n after the child had been fully medically diagnosed  was relatively common in the pimd ( 23.5% ) and physical disability groups ( 28.6% ) . \n when a parent suffered from signs of psychiatric disturbances , more than half of the children experienced maltreatment . \n physical neglect was most common in all groups , accounting for about 50% of the cases . in comparison with the other groups , in the pdd group , the child was likely to be emotionally disturbed and confined indoors ( 32.6% ) , in the pimd group , the child was mostly confined indoors ( 33.3%...",

    "input": "non - crystallographic symmetry ( ncs ) is common in macromolecular crystals , occurring in about 1/3 or more of structures in the protein data bank [ 2 , 3 , 24 ] . though non - crystallographic symmetry increases the complexity of structure determination , in most cases it yields a distinct advantage in this process because it brings with it information on relationships between density in different parts of the crystal and between coordinates in different parts of the structure [ 4 , 1214 ] . \n these relationships greatly improve density modification and refinement , two key steps in structure determination . \n one is simple examination of a model that has more than one copy of a chain . \n it can be used after molecular replacement has been carried out or after a model has been built . \n another approach is to find symmetry relationships among subsets of atoms in a heavy - atom or anomalously scattering atom substructure [ 11 , 17 ] . \n these symmetry relationships often reflect non - crystallographic symmetry , and the presence of the ncs can be checked by comparison of the density in the resulting electron density map at ncs - related positions and orientations . \n this approach can be used near the beginning of a sad , mad , or other structure determination where a substructure is obtained prior to full structure determination . \n this approach may be difficult to apply if there are only one or two atoms per ncs copy in the substructure and the ncs does not have point - group symmetry . \n this is because the relative orientations of the ncs - related parts of the substructure are not known in this case . \n a third approach that can be applied in cases where proper ncs ( e.g. , a two - fold axis ) is present is to search for locations in a map where nearby points related by proper symmetry have similar density . \n a fourth and very general approach to finding non - crystallographic symmetry is to find patterns of density that are present in more than one part of an electron density map . \n used a step - wise procedure of first finding possible c locations with pattern - matching techniques , classifying the locations with rotation - invariant classifiers , and then finding pairs of these locations that have similar patterns of density surrounding them . \n this method can be fast and effective , but has the potential limitations that the map has to be of high enough quality to locate c positions and that for maximal speed the patterns of density need to be initially represented in a rotation - invariant fashion . here \n we present an approach to finding non - crystallographic symmetry by directly searching for patterns of density that are present in more than one place in a map . \n this approach uses superposition of a cut - out region of the map with the remainder of the map , and therefore can make use of all the local features in a map , not just rotation - invariant ones . in this approach , an fft - based convolution search [ 5 , 16 ] \n is used to find orientations and translations that relate parts of a map to other parts of a map . \n we find that this is a rapid and accurate way to identify ncs , even in a case where the map is poor and the correlation of ncs - related density is low . \n the approach used here to identify non - crystallographic symmetry from an electron density map has three basic parts . \n first , a location in the map is found that is likely to be inside the molecule . \n this is important as it is the local symmetry of the molecule or molecules in the crystal that are of interest , so considering a region inside the molecule is essential for success . \n the method used to identify such a location in the map is similar to a method commonly used to distinguish macromolecule from solvent in a map . for each grid point in the electron density map , the local rms variation in electron density is calculated . \n this is done by simply calculating the standard deviation of the density in the map inside a sphere with radius r ( typically 10   ) , centered at the grid point in question . \n then the grid point in the map with the highest local standard deviation of density is considered the best candidate for a position inside the macromolecule . \n additional points likely to be inside the macromolecule can optionally be found by choosing additional grid points with high local variation in density that are well separated ( typically at least 15   ) from previously chosen locations . \n next , a search for ncs relating the density near the candidate point inside the macromolecule with density elsewhere in the asymmetric unit of the crystal is carried out . to make the calculation rapid \n , the resolution of the map used for this calculation may be chosen to be lower than the resolution of the original map ( typically a resolution of 4   is used ) \n . a sphere of density ( typically with a radius of 10   ) is cut out of the map , centered at this position within the molecule . \n this sphere of density is the object that is to be compared with density everywhere in the map . \n possible rotations of this sphere of density are sampled ( typically each rotation differing by about 20 degrees from all others ) . for each rotation , \n the density is transformed to the new orientation , and an fft - based convolution search [ 5 , 16 ] is used to identify non - crystallographic translations that yield a high correlation of density . \n these rotation / translation pairs that yield high correlation ( typically all those at or above 75  % of the highest value found ) represent a possible set of ncs operators relating the various copies of the molecule in the asymmetric unit of the unit cell . \n additionally , the candidate point used to identify ncs and the ncs - related points in the map may be considered approximate centers of regions where ncs applies . they are used below as the starting point for identification of the region where ncs operators apply . \n once a set of candidate ncs operators is obtained , the correlation of ncs - related density is examined in the original map , and the ncs operators are refined . \n this is done using the same approach as has been applied to ncs operators obtained from heavy - atom positions . \n first the shape and position of the local region that is repeated by ncs ( the asymmetric unit of ncs ) is found . \n then the ncs operators are refined to maximize the correlation of density among these ncs - related regions . \n the region where ncs applies is assumed to contain the point identified in the first step of our procedure that is within the macromolecule . \n a region with arbitrary shape surrounding this point is then chosen by sequential addition of new boundary points such that the local correlation of ncs - related density at each point in the region is above a threshold ( typically 1/4 of the maximum correlation in the region ) . \n the local correlation of density   is calculated using map grid points within a sphere ( normally with the radius used for identification of the solvent boundary , terwilliger 2000b ) , centered at the point in question . \n if the final correlation of ncs - related density ( averaged over all pairs of ncs - related points ) is above a threshold ( typically 0.4 ) then the ncs operators are considered to represent actual ncs in the crystal and are used in later stages of structure determination . in cases where the starting map is very poor , \n this threshold may be decreased , increasing the sensitivity of the procedure but also increasing the probability of finding ncs where none is present . \n the approach used here to identify non - crystallographic symmetry from an electron density map has three basic parts . \n first , a location in the map is found that is likely to be inside the molecule . \n this is important as it is the local symmetry of the molecule or molecules in the crystal that are of interest , so considering a region inside the molecule is essential for success . \n the method used to identify such a location in the map is similar to a method commonly used to distinguish macromolecule from solvent in a map . for each grid point in the electron density map , the local rms variation in electron density is calculated . \n this is done by simply calculating the standard deviation of the density in the map inside a sphere with radius r ( typically 10   ) , centered at the grid point in question . \n then the grid point in the map with the highest local standard deviation of density is considered the best candidate for a position inside the macromolecule . \n additional points likely to be inside the macromolecule can optionally be found by choosing additional grid points with high local variation in density that are well separated ( typically at least 15   ) from previously chosen locations . \n next , a search for ncs relating the density near the candidate point inside the macromolecule with density elsewhere in the asymmetric unit of the crystal ...",

    "input": "putting a halt to the rising trend in overweight prevalence has high priority in public health policy all over the developed world . \n prevention , preferably starting at an early age , is considered as the key strategy to achieve this goal , and considerable effort is put into the design of preventive measures .   whereas we know in general terms that overweight is the result of an unbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure , development of effective preventive measures requires a much more specific understanding .   specific dietary habits and ( in)activities associated with overweight risk in specific age groups need to be identified and their quantitative contribution to the overweight prevalence in the population needs to be assessed . \n in addition , we need to know whether the importance of specific behaviors for the development of overweight differs between sub groups in the population . \n it is well established that children from families with a low socio - economic status and children with overweight parents are at increased risk to develop overweight [ 39 ] . \n it is therefore particularly important to assess the role of behavioral risk factors specifically in these children , since they are the priority target groups for interventions to prevent and reduce overweight . \n the aim of this study was to identify specific behavioral risk factors for overweight in young children and to assess their quantitative contribution to the prevalence of overweight in the general population and in high risk sub groups . in a large population - based birth cohort , we prospectively investigated associations between dietary habits , screen time and physical activity when the children were 5 and 7 years old and overweight at the age of 8 years . \n we also assessed the role of these behavioral factors separately in high risk sub groups : children of mothers with overweight and children of mothers with low education . \n we estimated the reduction of overweight prevalence that could be achieved if the prevalence of risk factors would be reduced . \n the study population consisted of children who participated in the dutch prevention and incidence of asthma and mite allergy ( piama ) birth cohort study . \n the baseline study population consisted of 4146 pregnant women , recruited from the general population in 1996 - 1997 . \n postal questionnaires , including questions on the child 's lifestyle and health , were sent to the parents during pregnancy , at the child 's ages of 3 and 12 months , and yearly thereafter up to the age of 8 years . at the age of 8 years , the children were invited for a medical examination which included measurement of weight and height . \n the study protocol was approved by the medical ethics committees of the participating institutes , and all parents gave written informed consent . of the baseline population of 4146 pregnant women , 183 ( 5% ) \n were lost to follow - up before any data on the child had been collected . \n parental completed questionnaires from age 3 months to 8 years were available for 3934 , 3817 , 3694 , 3563 , 3518 , 3473 , 3373 , and 3269 children , respectively . \n when the medical examination of 8-year - old children was planned , 3668 children ( 93% of 3963 ) were still in the study , 3522 children were invited and 2214 participated ( 63% of those invited ) and had their weight and height measured . \n 146 of the 3668 children were not invited for the medical examination , although they were still participating in the study . in the majority of cases \n the reason for this was that their families had moved and were now living too far away from the study centers where the medical examination was conducted . \n complete data on overweight and risk factors were available for 1871 children ( 47% of the 3963 children in the study at birth ) . during the medical examination of the 8-year - old children , \n weight was measured to 0.1  kg and height to 0.1  cm by trained research staff using calibrated measuring equipment . from the weight and height measurements \n bmi ( body mass index : weight ( kg)/height ( m ) ) was calculated . \n overweight  and  obesity  were defined according to age and gender - specific international standards that use cutoff points equivalent to the 25  kg / m and 30  kg / m cut - offs that are commonly used for adults . \n the term  overweight  is used for the total group of children who were overweight , including those who were obese . for physical activity , 3 indicators were selected : time spent walking or cycling to school ( 3 categories ) , membership of a sports club ( yes / no ) , and time spent playing outside ( 3 categories ) .  screen time  ( 4 categories ) included time spent watching television , video 's , or at the computer . \n for dietary intake , 3 indicators were used : fast food consumption , snack consumption , and soft drink consumption . \n data on these exposures were obtained from the questionnaires administered at the ages of 5 and 7 years . \n these questionnaires contained a food frequency questionnaire with 40 different items and 5 answering categories per item ( ranging from  never in the last month  to  on 6 - 7 days per week  ) , which was used to construct the dietary exposure variables . for  fast food consumption \n a score was constructed based on the consumption frequencies of chips / french fries and of foods like hamburgers and hot dogs . \n snack consumption  was based on the reported consumption frequencies of 7 different foods / food groups including pie / cake , muffins , candy bars , sweets , chocolate , biscuits , and crisps . \n soft drink consumption  was based on the reported frequencies of consumption of 4 types of soft drinks . \n each of these variables was based on a number of different items , which differed with respect to their energy content . to be able to  add up \n the different items , total weekly energy intake from each item was calculated based on the reported frequencies , assuming average portion sizes and average energy content per portion . \n data on maternal education and maternal weight and height were obtained from the questionnaire completed when the child was 1 year old . \n maternal bmi was calculated from reported weight and height and overweight and was defined as a bmi 25  kg / m . \n the associations between the exposure variables and overweight at the age of 8 years were analysed by logistic regression , adjusted for gender and birth weight . \n exposure variables were constructed using the data collected at both the age of 5 and at the age of  7  years in order to obtain a more stable estimate of exposure during the years preceding the measurement of weight and height . walking / cycling to school , playing outside and screen time \n were recorded in categories , numbered 1 , 2 , and 3 for walking / cycling to school , 1 , 2 , and 3 for playing outside , and 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 for screen time ( see table 1 ) . \n the data collected at the ages of 5 and 7 years , were combined by taking the mean of the numbers of the categories reported at the ages of 5 and 7 years respectively . \n this resulted in ordinal variables with 5 categories for walking / cycling to school ( ranging from never at ages 5 and 7 to > 1/2 an hour per day at both ages ) , 5 categories for playing outside ( ranging from < 1  x per week at ages 5 and 7 to > 3  x per week at both ages ) and 7 categories for screen time ( ranging from < 1/2 an hour per day at ages 5 and 7 to > 2 hours per day at both ages ) . after having checked for nonlinearity \n fast food , snack and soft drink consumption at age 57 ( the mean of the consumption scores at age 5 and at age 7 ) , were included in the regression analyses as linear variables , but are shown in categories ( tertiles ) in table 1 . \n overweight ( including obesity ) was used as the outcome measure in the regression analyses . \n the number of obese children was too small for analyses with fully adjusted regression models , and obesity was therefore not used as outcome measure in these analyses . in previous studies in the piama cohort , breast feeding was investigated in relation to overweight risk and was found to be associated with reduced overweight risk   [ 12 , 13 ] . although breastfeeding is not the subject of this study , results on breast feeding are shown in the tables for completeness . in additional analyses , \n the associations of physical activity and diet with overweight were also assessed separately for the exposures at age 5 and at age 7 . \n thirteen percent of all the data potentially in the study ( 3963 participants  20 variables   =   79260 ) were missing and 2092 children ( 53% ) had a missing value on at least 1 of the variables . \n if data are not  missing completely at random  ( mcar ) , complete case analysis may lead to biased results [ 14 , 15 ] .   in our dataset \n several variables ( including maternal education and breast feeding ) were associated with the pr...",

efficiency aerosol collectors that impinge the sampled air into a liquid buffer which is tested for bwas using antibody - based handheld assays ( hhas ) . \n civilian first responders use similar versions of these antibody - based hhas for testing suspicious powder samples suspected to contain bwas . depending on which manufacturer of hha \n is being tested , the technology can be low cost , requires no electrical power , and requires minimal to no sample preparation to test a sample . \n it was an hha panel manufactured by the dod that first identified bacillus anthracis in the powder that spilled across a desk in senator daschle 's office in the hart senate office building in 2001 . \n three years later , a dod hha was again used to identify ricin toxin in the mail room of the dirksen senate office building . \n these instances demonstrate that , when hha technologies are used appropriately by an experienced operator trained to understand what the results mean , they can be a useful tool . \n additionally , hhas have proven fast and effective in the laboratory for the detection of francisella tularensis   and biotoxins such as staphylococcal enterotoxin b ( seb )   and microcystins .   the dod has initiated an effort called the joint chemical biological and radiological agent water monitor ( jcbrawm ) program to develop a system which will allow rapid field testing of drinking water supplies used by military personnel . \n the effectiveness of hhas in detecting biological agents in the air and in powders has resulted in a desire to test these assays to gauge their effectiveness to protect drinking water supplies used by us warfighters . in the present study , hhas from multiple manufacturers were evaluated for their effectiveness at detecting two specific targets , seb and ricin , in multiple water matrices . \n the hhas were not modified in any way to optimize for the detection of toxins within water supplies despite the fact that they were initially developed to test for concentrated agent collected from high - efficiency aerosol collectors and impinged into a phosphate buffered saline ( pbs ) solution rather than to test unbuffered water supplies . \n the ability of the hhas to detect seb and ricin in four different water matrices , representative of waters used by different branches of the armed forces , was evaluated . \n the four different water matrices were formulated tap water , formulated tap water with 1  mg / l free available chlorine ( fac ) , water treated by reverse osmosis ( ro ) with 1  mg / l fac , and ro water with 2  mg / l total residual bromine . suggested health effect levels as used by the us military for ricin and seb are 455  ng / ml and 4.55  ng / ml , respectively . \n these minimal health effect levels were derived using the tri service standards for field water and based on an average consumption of 10 liters per day for seven days for a 70  kg service member . therefore , detection of ricin and seb in water at or below the suggested health effect level is desired . \n both singleplex ( one - line ) and multiplex ( two - line and two - dot ) hha models produced by two manufacturers were evaluated in the present study for the detection of ricin toxin and seb [ 5 , 6 ] . \n active seb ( toxin technologies , sarasota , fla , usa ) and active ricin whole toxin ( vector laboratories , burlington , on , canada ) were obtained from the dod 's critical reagents program ( crp ) for use in the present study . \n briefly , approximately 500  ml of astm type i deionized water was added to a one -

parietal region of the scalp followed by eyelashes , eyebrows , pubic hair , body hair and facial hair . \n this results in patchy loss of hair , often in a bizarre or angular pattern , in which the hairs are twisted and broken at various distances from the clinically normal scalp . \n a hairball , trichobezoar , is a rare accompaniment of ttm in those who also eat the plucked hair ( trichophagia ) . in our study , \n most of the patients belonged to adolescent , and middle age group and most of them were females . \n all of them presented with patchy hair loss over the scalp , none of the patients gave a history of hair loss in other areas . \n only one patient had a history of eating of pulled hairs , but there were no signs and symptoms of trichobezoar in her . \n the diagnosis of ttm is often difficult as other hair loss diseases appear similar in clinical manifestations . \n this difficulty is encountered especially with alopecia areata ( aa ) . as ttm often coexists with aa \n trichoscopy is a novel diagnostic technique , both simple and noninvasive , can be used as a handy bed side tool for diagnosing common hair and scalp disorder . \n several common trichoscopy features of ttm were identified . decreased hair density , hairs broken at different lengths , short hairs with trichoptilosis ( \" split ends \" ) are described in the literature as diagnostic of ttm . \n authors observed these findings in all the patients , and this is due to irregular and repetitive pulling of hairs leading to damage to the cuticle . irregular coiled hairs and upright re - growing hairs are also reported to be seen in ttm . in this study , these findings were demonstrated in 80% of patients . coiled hair results from hair shaft fracture and coiling of the remaining proximal part which is fixed to the scalp . \n black dots are believed to be remnants of hair shafts arising from tapering hairs , broken hairs , and bent hairs . in a study conducted by shim et al . \n rakowska et al . observed that black dots tend to be uniform in size and shape in aa , whereas in ttm and tinea capitis they are variable in diameter and round , oval , irregular in shape . \n it presents as a red dot corresponding to follicular ostia capped or stuffed with the blood clot and suggests a history of traumatic forced plucking . \n recently , flame hairs , v - sign , tulip hairs , and hair powder are described , and authors claim these signs are specific only for ttm . \n flame hairs are semi - transparent , wavy and cone - shaped hair residues , which develop as a result of severe mechanical hair pulling and shredding . \n v -

    "input": "with the goal of discovering the genes that contribute to the risk of common diseases , numerous susceptibility loci have been identified using linkage analysis . despite replication of many of these linkages in a second sample , \n some exceptions include tbc1d1 , identified as the gene responsible for the obesity linkage on chromosome 4p15 - 14 , and hoxb13 , identified as the gene responsible for the prostate cancer linkage on chromosome 17q21 - 22 . \n however , for many other common disease linkage signals , the underlying causal genes and variants await discovery . \n the expectation that a single gene accounts for a linkage peak may contribute to the difficulty in identifying causal genes . on the contrary \n attributed a triglyceride linkage on chromosome 7q36 to variants in five genes and christians et al . \n found that fine - mapping caused a single quantitative trait locus ( qtl ) for body size in mice to resolve first into three qtls , then one of those to split into two . \n furthermore , the clustering of causal genes may have stymied the multi - group effort to identify type 2 diabetes ( t2d ) genes on chromosome1q ; two strong associations present in populations of european ancestry failed replication and confirmation in other ethnic groups . \n these examples suggest that abandoned linkage findings might yet reveal susceptibility genes if reappraised while considering the possibility of multiple causal genes . as for other common diseases , \n the challenge is even greater in african american ( aa ) populations where both prevalence and genetic diversity are higher , and pathophysiology may differ . \n genome wide case - control association studies ( gwass ) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) with small effects on t2d risk , but few of the associated snps , identified primarily in european ancestry populations , are replicated in aas and few snps have been identified in aa populations . in general , the widespread rejection of family studies in favor of gwass has failed to produce the promised prognostic and diagnostic variants for t2d . as a resource for the discovery of genes related to t2d and its complications , the american diabetes association established the genetics of niddm ( gennid ) study . from 1993 to 2003 \n we have used this resource to increase understanding of the genetics of t2d by applying linkage and family - based association analysis to the african american ( aa ) subset of the gennid sample . \n genome - wide linkage analysis using genotypes on 5,914 snps identified chromosomal regions that potentially harbor risk genes for t2d and age of t2d diagnosis ( aod ) . \n the strongest signal for t2d occurred on chromosome 2 at 95121 megabases ( mb ) , with weaker support for aod in the same region and for t2d at 6895 mb . \n both t2d and aod also showed linkage on chromosome 13 at 1930 mb , but linkage was limited to t2d on chromosome 7 at 5079 mb and to aod on chromosome 18 at 3165 mb . \n other analyses inferred pleiotropy with triglyceride in the chromosome 2p region and pleiotropy with obesity in the chromosome 13 region . herein we present linkage and association analyses on the aa subset of the gennid sample using genotypes on 9,203 fine - mapping snps added to the genome scan snps used previously . \n our first goal was to more precisely localize the t2d susceptibility genes in each of the five chromosomal regions identified in the genome scan ( chromosome 2 at 6895 and 95121 mb , chromosome 7 at 5079 mb , chromosome 13 at 1930 mb , and chromosome 18 at 3165 mb ) . \n our second goal was to test for association of the gene - based fine - mapping snps with t2d and aod in order to identify genes related to t2d in aas . \n the gennid study ascertained families through sibling pairs each with a t2d diagnosis . during phase 1 , \n extended family members were also studied ; one site ascertained aas . during phase 2 , data collection beyond the sibling pair was limited to parents , or , if parents were unavailable , unaffected siblings ; five sites ascertained aas . during phase 3 , only affected sibling pairs and trios were studied ;

for this study , we selected an informative subset of 1,077 members of 415 pedigrees . \n t2d diagnoses , originally following national diabetes data group criteria , were re - evaluated using current criteria prior to all analyses ; 84 affected and 13 unaffected sample members were re - assigned as unknown . \n body mass index ( bmi ) was computed from height and weight obtained from physical examination . \n we selected a subset of the sample for fine - mapping by excluding unaffected individuals below age 53 , the age by which onset had occurred in 75% of cases , and then any individual , either affected or unaffected , who consequently had no family members in the sample . \n this sample subset maintained significant lod scores in each of the linkage regions and produced power over 80% to detect association . \n power to produce a p - value of 0.00001 was estimated from simulation of 1000 replicates of a snp with minor allele frequency 0.4 and heterozygous effect a 10% increase in penetrance at age 50 for t2d or 3 year increase in aod . for fine - map genotyping , we used snagger ( http://snagger.sourceforge.net/ ) to select tagsnps within genes in the linkage regions on chromosomes 2 , 7 , 13 , and 18 . using hapmap phase 1 and 2 ( http://hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov ) , \n variants in the region were tagged at linkage disequilibrium ( ld ) r  0.7 . \n each snp selected had minor allele frequency > 0.1 and illumina design score > 0.4 ;

for example , during the monkey 's pregnancy , the light exposition during night hours induces a lower body temperature and absence of circadian rhythm of temperature in the newborn . in humans , \n different reports showed that the alterations of the circadian system increased the risks of cancer [ 2123 ] , preeclampsia , diabetes [ 3 , 25 ] , and mood disorder . \n curiously , a large quantity of polymorphisms has been detected in clock genes , which can be influencing the development of diseases through different physiological systems . \n this review will primarily focus on the hypothesis which states that the variation of genetic components of the circadian system , similar to environmental changes , can affect several physiological systems and produce an elevation of the risk of developing a disease . in recent years \n , there has been a significant increase in available information from polymorphic variations and epigenetic modification over clock genes and their risk of diseases . \n the report of health from the united states ( 2014 ) showed about 10% of population have a poor health associated with pathologies such as obesity ( 35.5% ) , hypercholesterolemia ( 30% ) , diabetes ( 32% ) , and cancer ( 6.4% ) . curiously , despite its low frequency in population , cancer is the second cause of death in the united states . \n the above pathologies add the infertility , which affects about 10.9% of women in the united states   and 17% of women in other developed countries . during short - stay in the hospital , \n mood disorder and psychosis are the principal causer of hospital stay during 2014 and represent the third cause of morbidity worldwide . \n this present research reports the last single nucleotide polymorphism ( snp ) associated with an elevated risk of developing principal pathologies worldwide such as mood disorder , infertility , cancer , metabolism and diabetes   and addictions , and a description of usefulness for a more detailed study in other pathologies . \n in mammals , the circadian system is a supraphysiological system that regulates biological functions every 24 h   such as glucose homeostasis , temperature , blood pressure , tone in the coronary artery , and heart rate . \n the bmal1/clock complex target genes are related to the circadian expression of metabolic pathways as was observed by hatanaka et al .   through high resolution \n the author detected a circadian expression of ( i ) glucose metabolism - related genes such as glut2 , por , pck1 , and gys2 and ( ii ) cholesterol metabolism - related genes such as cyp2a4 , cyp2a5 , cyp4a14 , cyp7a1 , and cyp2c55 ; and considering the very important role these systems have in metabolism , any alteration of them can have negative health effects . \n today there are several metabolic problems affecting the population , such as obesity , hyperglycemia , dyslipidemia , and hypertension . \n the cooccurrence of three or more metabolic disorders , including obesity , is defined as  metabolic syndrome  , showing a prevalence in the united states during 2009 - 2010 of about 22% of adults ( 21.4626.15 ) . the insulin resistance or type \n 2 diabetes is one of the most important metabolic diseases currently affecting about 366 million people , causing more than 3.8 million deaths , and showing a rise in the number of affected people as observed in the united states population during 19992010 . \n several factors could be increasing the risk of death by diabetes , such as dyslipidemia , hypertension , and obesity , all of which are driving to an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease . \n a variant of this pathology can also develop during the pregnancy ( gestational diabetes mellitus ) and is characterized by glucose intolerance   in the mother and adverse consequences for her offspring , such as an increase in blood pressure , body mass index ( bmi ) , and body fat and a decrease in hdl levels . at the molecular level , \n both diseases have in common the impairment of signal transduction of insulin receptors such as pi3kinase / akt and ras / map kinases [ 42 , 45 , 46 ] , leading to metabolic dysregulations   such as inhibitions of glycogen synthesis , impaired translocation of glut4 to plasmatic membrane , or antilipolytic effects of insulin in white adipose tissue [ 39 , 46 ] . \n meta - analyses from 448 articles reporting shift work and health consequence have detected a strong relationship between shift work , a potent chronodisruptor , and diabetes mellitus type 2 ( odd ratio about 1.42 times higher than day workers ) . \n however , this is not the only chronodisruption which we are exposed too . in animal models exposed to light / dark patterns similar to shift work , the length of the working day and changes of feeding times induce a modification of the liver weight and plasmatic glucose and a modification of the circadian profile for glucose , insulin , and triglyceride . \n these findings add to the observation in the circadian disruption in mutant animals , showing alterations of cholesterol metabolism , abolition of the circadian production of glycerol , free fatty acids , and impaired expression of rate - limiting lipolytic enzymes such as lipase , all of which add to increased weight gain , adipocyte hypertrophy , high level of glucose , glucose intolerance , and hypersecretion of insulin [ 4952 ] . \n polymorphic variations of clock genes can be incrementing the risks of developing a disease similar to chronodisruption by environmental changes as it has been detected in human metabolic disorders ( see table 1 ) . \n for example , the genotyping of clock genes in 346 greek pregnant women and their risk of diabetes was performed , detecting that the polymorphisms of bmal1 rs7950226 and rs11022775 are associated with gestational diabetes mellitus ( p = 0.025 , or = 1.46 and p = 4.455e  06 , or = 2.64 , resp . ) , while the study of the haplotype analysis of rs7950226/rs11022775 showed a major frequency in women with gestational diabetes mellitus ( p = 0.0069 , or = 6.96 ) . \n similarly , a study performed in subjects from the united kingdom and pakistan reported that cry1 and cry2 polymorphisms rs2292912 and rs12315175 , respectively , are associated with diabetes ( p = 0.015 and 0.008 , resp . ) . moreover \n , the variant rs12315175 for cry2 has a tendency to elevate the risk at about 5% compared to the variation of cry1 ( or = 1.05 and 0.95 , resp . ) . \n also , the authors did not find associations between diabetes and bmal1 polymorphisms rs7950226 and rs11022775 , as occurs in gestational diabetes mellitus . \n genotyping of 19,000 adults from northern sweden for variants rs8192440 for cry1 and rs11605924 for cry2 is associated with higher level of glucose concentrations at 2 hours ( p = 0.06 and p = 0.005 , resp . ) . \n another study genotyping 1304 individuals from 424 british families , containing at least one patient with diabetes type 2 ( diabetes in families study collection ) , demonstrates the relation between bmal1 polymorphisms rs7950226 and rs11022775 and diabetes ( p = 0.002 ) , reinforcing what...",

specific dephosphorylation remains to be developed . sequence and structural homology of the catalytic subunits of ppp family members \n has revealed a conserved catalytic mechanism in which a divalent metal cation activates a water molecule to hydrolyze phospho - serine / threonine without the formation of a phosphoenzyme intermediate ( reviewed in [ 1012 ] ) . despite a shared catalytic mechanism , substrate specificity within the ppp family \n for example , the ppp calcineurin ( also known as protein phosphatase 2b ) has been shown to interact with two consensus sequences , pxixit and lxvp , found on nonsubstrate - interacting proteins and target substrates ( reviewed in [ 11 , 13 ] ) . for protein phosphatase-1 ( pp1 ) , substrate specificity is conferred by incorporation of pp1-interacting proteins via a conserved docking motif with a general consensus sequence of rvxf ( reviewed in [ 11 , 12 ] ) . at present , consensus sequences in pp2a substrates have not been identified . \n this review will focus on our emerging understanding of pp2a substrate specificity , which appears to involve additive effects of multiple discrete interactions . \n pp2a is a highly conserved serine / threonine phosphatase which , depending on the tissue of origin and cell type , may account for up to 1% of cellular protein and the majority of serine / threonine phosphatase activity . \n the physiological functions of pp2a have been implicated in all facets of cellular existence ( reviewed in ) . \n further , pp2a functions as a critical tumor suppressor whose interruption leads to proliferative diseases . \n the heterotrimeric holoenzyme is composed of a catalytic subunit ( c ) a scaffold subunit ( a ) and one member of four families of regulatory subunits ( b ) ( figure 1 ) . \n the diversity of pp2a heterotrimers is achieved through expression of two c subunits , two a subunits and approximately fifteen b subunits in vertebrates . \n the b subunits are derived from four diverse gene families ( b , b , b , and b ) that have little sequence similarity between families but maintain high sequence similarity within families . \n the b family ( b55 , pr55 , ppp2r2 ) of regulatory subunits consists of four genes (  ,  ,  ,  ) , the b - family ( b56 , pr61 , ppp2r5 ) is comprised of five isoforms (  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) , the b family ( pr72 , ppp2r3 ) includes three isoforms ( /pr72/130 , /pr59 , /pr48 ) , and the b family ( pr93/pr110 ) is made up of three proteins ( sg2na , striatin , and mmob1 ) . \n there is some controversy as to whether the b family members , most notably sg2na , are bona fide pp2a regulatory subunits that always associate with the ac dimer or whether they are merely regulated by association with the pp2a dimer . \n given the large number of pp2a subunits , it is thought that each cell expresses a dozen or more distinct holoenzyme complexes which act on a diverse array of substrates . \n pp2a holoenzyme diversity has been the subject of several excellent papers [ 14 , 15 , 18 ] . like pp1 , regulatory subunit incorporation is thought to dictate the substrate specificity of the pp2a complex , however , only recently have molecular studies begun to develop insight into the mechanism by which the regulatory subunit acts . \n the results from recent studies suggests a multitiered mechanism wherein pp2a substrate specificity arises from ( 1 ) subcellular localization of pp2a defined by the b subunit , ( 2 ) selective holoenzyme assembly by posttranslational modification , ( 3 ) interaction with specific endogenous inhibitors , ( 4 ) interactions between the b subunit and phosphosubstrates at sites distant from the active site , and ( 5 ) b - subunit residues which infiltrate the catalytic cleft of the c subunit . \n this paper will provide a summary of these studies and how the understanding of the determinants of pp2a substrate specificity has advanced . \n the heterotrimeric holoenzyme is targeted to discrete subcellular locales dictated in part by which b - regulatory subunit is incorporated . \n the localization imparted by the b - regulatory subunit dictates the spatial sphere of influence of the holoenzyme complex for potential substrates . \n this mechanism of targeting pp2a activity is highlighted by extensive studies of the b family of regulatory subunits . \n for instance , the b family regulatory subunits target the holoenzyme to different cellular compartments in the brain . specifically , b and b are primarily cytosolic where as the b-regulatory subunit associates with a detergent - resistant protein fraction consistent with an interaction at the cytoskeleton \n .    similar diversity has been observed in the b family of regulatory subunits . a c - terminal nuclear export signal common to b , b , and b which , when these regulatory subunits are incorporated into the pp2a holoenzyme , results in cytoplasmic localization of the heterotrimer . b and b isoforms lack a similar sequence and are found primarily in the nucleus . in cardiomyocytes , b interacts with the protein ankyrin - b through its c - terminus which leads to localization at the cardiac m - line . \n b on the other hand has been shown to target the holoenzyme complex to subnuclear structures in cardiomyocytes where pp2a / b may regulate gene expression . \n loss of proper subcellular targeting of pp2a has been implicated in the biogenesis and aggressive phenotype of neoplastic growths . \n specifically , a truncated form of b ( b ) , has been isolated from a melanoma cell line wherein the pp2a/b complex is targeted to the trans - golgi network , blunts p53 responsiveness , contributes to genetic instability and increases metastatic motility [ 2427 ] . \n this was first observed in a member of the b family , b. two neuron - specific isoforms of b , b1 , and b2 , are generated by the use of an alternative 5 exon which results in the production of a divergent n - terminal extension on b2 [ 28 , 29 ] . \n the n - terminal extension of b2 directs the holoenzyme complex to the outer mitochondrial membrane ( omm ) by targeting the mitochondrial translocase complex and forming an abortive complex resistant to import into the mitochondrial matrix [ 28 , 30 ] . \n the omm - directed pp2a / b2 complex promotes fragmentation of the mitochondria reticulum and increases cell susceptibility to proapoptotic insults through an unknown mechanism . \n alternative splicing of b - regulatory subunits directing subcellular localization of the pp2a holoenzyme has also been observed in both the b and b families . \n two b isoforms differ by the inclusion or exclusion an n - terminal nuclear localization signal leading to isoform - specific nuclear or cytoplasmic localization . \n the murine - specific b family member , b , is also subject to alternative splicing leading to isoform - specific nuclear or cytoplasmic localization through an as yet unidentified mechanism . \n for example , the interaction between pp2a / b and shugoshin during meiosis is crucial for spatial and temporal regulation of sister chromatid disjunction . during meiosis , the cohesin complexes , which link the arms of bivalent chromosomes and the centromeres of sister chromatids , \n must be released in a stepwise fashion by the protease separase ; the cohesin complex is firstly hydrolyzed along the arms of the bivalent chromosomes for completion of anaphase i and secondly at the centromeres of sister chromatids for completion of anaphase ii . during anaphase \n i , the centromeric cohesin complex is protected from separase - dependent proteolysis by shugoshin [ 34 , 35 ] . \n shugoshin recruits pp2a / b to the centromere which likely results in dephosphorylation of the cohesin complex leading to protection of the cohesin complex from separase - dependent proteolysis [ 36 , 37 ] . through cocrystallization , \n xu and colleagues , have revealed that dimeric human shugoshin 1 interacts with pp2a / b through ...",

goldman - rakic and selemon , 1997 ) , or more generally the inability to integrate neural processes in different brain areas , a syndrome termed dysconnectivity ( stephan et al . \n this condition may pare down , in particular , the input to pyramidal cells of the dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal cortex ( garey et al . \n these cells are glutamatergic and receive projections from the thalamus and widespread cortical areas , and hence are likely to be involved in higher - level cognition . \n reduced connectivity may thus lead to fragmentation , a loss of coherence in cognitive activity . \n graph theory enables us to model the loss of connectivity in simulated neuronal networks and predict the time course of fragmentation . on the face of it , \n percolation plays an important role in the evolution , growth , and maintenance of a large variety of natural , technological , and social systems ( ben avraham and havlin , 2000 ) . \n it refers to the probability of existence of a path between every pair of nodes in a graph , or equivalently , the graph being  connected \n whilst many previous studies have examined cortical network connectivity in schizophrenia and other disorders , none to our knowledge have employed the concept of percolation , an issue that we presently redress . \n the percolation function is the cumulative density function ( cdf ) of percolation as a function of connectivity . \n it is possible , in principle , to measure the percolation function in living neural tissue , by using progressive lesioning , for instance through the administration of inhibitory neurotransmitters ( breskin et al . , \n observations on human brain functional connectivity may be compared to the theoretical percolation function for random networks ( erds and rnyi , 1959 ) . \n the percolation function cp(n ) of a random graph of n vertices and e edges is given by cp(n ) = e the presence of a critical threshold motivates us to revisit the notion of cortical dysconnectivity as a sudden breakdown of percolation . \n there are , however , reasons to assume that the percolation threshold is neither the first , nor the most predominant , critical transition in the development of schizophrenia : brains are not random networks . in both the structural ( sporns and zwi , 2004 ) and functional ( salvador et al . \n 2006 ) domains , the hallmarks of brain organization include local clustering as expressed in high values for the clustering coefficient ( cc ) , high global connectedness as specified by a short characteristic path length ( cpl ) ( watts and strogatz , 1998 ) , and modularity ( murre and sturdy , 1995)a combination characteristic of modular small - world networks ( he et al . , 2009 ) . \n graph - theoretical studies ( murre and sturdy , 1995 ; watts and strogatz , 1998 ) showed that small - world and modular networks can secure global connectivity with a small number of connections . for brains configured as modular small - worlds , a few connections will suffice to ensure percolation . \n most likely , therefore , percolation is not the crucial bottleneck for brain pathologies such as schizophrenia . \n we will propose as an alternative theoretical possibility that , instead , brain pathologies are associated with a breakdown in the local organization . in schizophrenia patients , \n functional connectivity in scalp eeg channels appears to reflect a loss of clustering after correcting for differences in the density of functional connections ( micheloyannis et al . \n the question , therefore , arises , whether fragmentation can be understood as a critical breakdown in the ability of the brain to establish and maintain a modular small - world functional architecture . \n here we show by numerical simulations that in neural activity networks , with loss of connectivity a self - organizing small - world neural network can not sustain its local clustering , well before global connectivity breaks down . \n the iterated logistic map f(x)= 1  ax is unimodal on [ 1;1 ]  [ 1;1 ] and capable of both periodic and chaotic behavior depending on its control parameter a. in this study , we construct networks of coupled logistic maps , all with parameter a = 1.7 such that the dynamics of a single unit are chaotic under iteration of a randomly chosen initial activation value . a unit x is coupled with coupling strength  = 0.4 to any number mi of other units in the network such that its activation value xn + 1 at iteration n + 1 depends on the activation value of itself and all adjacent units at iteration n : \n\n in this equation , b(i ) is the set of units adjacent to unit i , mi is the number of units adjacent to unit i. the coupling strength  is divided by mi , and has a compensation term ( 1   ) to make sure that logistic map of an individual unit retains its mapping [ 1:1 ]  [ 1:1 ] , and thus functions properly for any numbers of adjacent units . a network of this type can be used to study the buildup and breakdown of modularity resulting from hebbian adaptive structural self - organization . \n it implements a simple rewiring rule based on synchronization of chaotic activity and rewires at most one connection per iteration , carefully keeping the network 's total number of connections constant throughout the process . \n a single iteration of the network consists of four steps , to be repeated several times after an initial random inception : \n initialize the network . \n randomly establish e connections between v units to create a ( v , e ) random network , and initialize every unit with a random activation value [ 1:1 ] . \n though values of v and e are chosen such that a network has a high probability of being connected , this is not required.update units . \n synchronously update every unit 's activation value from its own and all its adjacent units ' activation values according to equation ( 1).select pivot and candidate . \n randomly select one unit from the network ( the pivot ) . from all other units , select the one whose activation value is closest to the pivot 's . \n then , from the units already adjacent to the pivot , select the one whose activation value is farthest from the pivot 's , and cut its connection to keep the number of connections constant . \n if there is already a connection between the pivot and the candidate , or if the pivot has zero connections , nothing happens and this step is skipped.iteration completed . \n randomly establish e connections between v units to create a ( v , e ) random network , and initialize every unit with a random activation value [ 1:1 ] . \n though values of v and e are chosen such that a network has a high probability of being connected , this is not required . \n synchronously update every unit 's activation value from its own and all its adjacent units ' activation values according to equation ( 1 ) . \n randomly select one unit from the network ( the pivot ) . from all other units , select the one whose activation value is closest to the pivot 's . \n then , from the units already adjacent to the pivot , select the one whose activation value is farthest from the pivot 's , and cut its connection to keep the number of connections constant . \n if there is already a connection between the pivot and the candidate , or if the pivot has zero connections , nothing happens and this step is skipped . \n networks implementing these iterative steps exhibit development from an initial random configuration to modular small - world configurations ( gong and van leeuwen , 2003 ;

existence of these conditions and the lack of sensitivity and specificity of the usual diagnostic tests make it difficult to diagnose dysphagia aortica with certainty . \n wilkinson et al.2 ) demonstrated that a video solid bolus swallow test could be useful in determining the manometric findings that are suspicious for dysphagia aortica when the standard evaluation fails . \n mild cases may be treated conservatively , such as avoiding sticky solids and feeding on a liquid diet . \n the surgical procedures include transposition of the distal esophagus , separation of the distal esophagus from the aorta , esophagomyotomy , division of the right crus of the diaphragm , aortic resection , and repair of an aneurysm . for patients who are not candidates for surgery , insertion of a feeding tube via percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy ( peg ) \n although we did not perform esophageal manometry , the patient 's symptoms and imaging studies were consistent with the classic findings of dysphagia aortica . \n although the patient declined any invasive procedures , a peg for a feeding tube might have been helpful for nutritional support . \n dysphagia aortica is an uncommon type of dysphagia that is caused by extrinsic mechanical compression . \n it should be differentiated from other causes of dysphagia , such as gastroesophageal reflux disease or motility disorders , because dysphagia aortica often requires surgical intervention that can significantly reduce the morbidity and these interventions can be curative in some situations .",

    "input": "from now on , molecular study regarding female sexuality has focused on female sexual hormone , like estrogen receptor ( er ) and er derivatives.12 but flibanserin is an agent of 5-hydroxytryptamin ( 5-ht ) type 1a receptor and an antagonist of 5-ht type 2a and thus a new molecular entity.3 flibanserin was originally developed as antidepressant drug . in clinical stage 2a as antidepressant , flibanserin could not prove its effectiveness , but almost no sexual function disorder was reported in subjects . for this reason , the arizona sexual experiences scale ( asex ) was used for making a comparison of the sexual function effectiveness of flibanserin on antidepressant vs. placebo proven in stage 2b studies among four depression programs.4 stage 2b studies have failed to prove its general effectiveness on depression , but in answering this question \" how intense is your sexual desire ? \" in the asex , flibanserin turned out to be more excellent in both placebo and active - comparator . \n since then , drug development has changed its directivity toward being a potential medicine for treating hypoactive sexual desire disorder ( hsdd ) . \n hsdd is chara or absence of sexual fantasy and sexual desire associated with personal pain in the 4th edition of the diagnostic and statistical manual - text revision ( dsm - iv - tr).5 determining lack or absence is done by clinicians by considering the factors influencing sexual activitie such as age and contexts of personal life . \n sexual function disorder is not explained well by other axis 1 disorders ( except other sexual function disorders ) and also it is not that it is caused only by direct physiological effects of materials ( i.e. , drug overuse , drug ) or overall medical status . \n the dsm-5 completed in 2013 addresses new illness called as female sexual interest / arousal disorder ( fsiad ) , which has both properties of hsdd and another illness of dsm - iv known as female sexual arousal disorder . \n flibanserin underwent new drug application ( nda ) as original drug in 2009 . the two central phase 3 studies ( violet6 , daisy7 ) all used e - diary and did not show big statistical improvement compared to placebo in the pre - specified co - primary efficacy endpoint that assessed daily sexual desire . in both violet6 and daisy7 studies , flibanserin showed an increase in satisfying sexual events ( sse ) and female sexual function index ( fsfi ) and reduction in female sexual distress scale - revised ( fsds - r ) , but did not show a meaningful increase in e - diary scores compared to placebo . in both studies , \n the most commonly reported adverse effects in women prescribed with flibanserin include drowsiness ( 11.8% ) , vertigo ( 10.5% ) , and fatigue ( 10.3%).67 these studies show a statistically significant improvement in secondary end points that measured sexual desire with other tools known as fsfi compared to placebo . \n applicants told that the effectiveness of flibanserin against sexual desire is better explained with fsfi , but most advisory committees did not agree to alteration in the e - diary evaluation method set as the one designed to evaluate sexual desire . \n the safety consciousness expressed by the advisory committees includes adverse effects such as fatigue and drowsiness as well as drug - drug interactions ( ddis ) and flibanserinalcohol interactions . \n another central stage 3 study is begonia,8 which set sse , fsfi , fsds - r as major evaluation methods rather than using e - diary in the existing viole and daisy studies and reported that flibanserin shows a statistically significant increase in sse and fsfi and reduction in fsds - r compared to placebo . \n however , many problems with safety were brought up in the second submission , too . \n vertigo , drowsiness , and vomiting are the most commonly reported adverse effects , and these occurred 2% to 3% , respectively if using placebo during stage 3 placebo - control premenopausal hsdd , whereas occurred close to 11% in subjects who used flibanserin as 100 mg every night at bedtime . \n events matching central nervous system depression ( fatigue , drowsiness , and vertigo ) occurred close to 21% in subjects who used flibanserin as 100 mg every night at bedtime and this proportion is three times higher than in placebo group . \n flibanserin is very difficult to endure if taking in combination with fluconazole and strong cytochrome p450 3a4 ( cyp3a4 ) suppressant and this combination may increase the risk of swoon and symptomatic low blood pressure . and \n ethanol administered in combination with flibanserin greatly increases the risk of drowsiness , fatigue , orthostatic hypotension , and swoon . \n additionally , these studies were limited to general healthy women who did not take benzodiazepines , sleep aid , narcotics and many other drugs . \n the effectiveness was not so big in general , and considering these concerns , fda refused to approve it again and recommended that additional safety studies are required . according to the latest fda review , there is no data indicating new efficacy . instead , flibanserin sponsors submitted additional safety data next day including research data proving that there is no obstacle to driving , data comparing the commercialized products and the side effects profile of these products , and analysis clarifying the potential effects of alcohol on side effects.9 despite the trustfulness of highly influential studies , fda product review is not a fundamental comparison , in fact , and so comparison of safety between individual products may be misunderstood . in particular , \n alcohol interaction study was conducted in 25 healthy volunteers as a sample , among which only two were female . \n since the refusal from fda in 2013 , a civic group called as even the score was formed to support what was called as \" gender equality \" in the manner approaching sexual function disorder treatment.10 this group insisted that there is no treatment for women although even 26 items for male sexual function disorder were already approved . \n this argument was rejected by fda on the ground that there are no approved products for low sexual desire in men and the 26 items for treatment contain various mixtures of testosterone . despite the fact that flibanserin is supported by consumer advocacy groups and consequently not the first product supported by pharmaceutical companies , fda 's argument on gender bias while regulating is worthy of notice in that the range of making efforts against this argument is from campaigns via social media even to letters from the members of the national assembly.11 another noteworthy feature in application for flibanserin to fda is use of the findings on sexual desire reported by patients as primary efficacy variable for approval . \n sexual desire can be seen by those who experience it and the results reported by patients can be measured without confounding this concept from others . \n the results reported by patients have become more important in studies and other drugs that have such results as primary end point have been approved ( although none were based on sexual desire ) . among all new molecular entities and biological permit applications approved by fda from 2006 to 2010 , \n gnanasakthy et al.12 found that among which , 17% ( 20 in 116 ) used the results reported by acknowledged patients as primary outcome in approval labels . \n the complex element in evaluating flibanserin lies in recalling the frequency of desire and extent of intensity and then measuring with fsfi index four weeks after the daily records of the most intense desires when applying for the primary desire end point first time . \n fda raised some concerns about optimizing fsfi as desire assessment tool , including the validity of contents and the period of recall , but the recent advisory committees did not focus on changing the primary end points or consulting the validity of fsfi . \n the final concern with flibanserin is associated with its use in clinical settings and this was an important issue for the committees . despite little reliable estimate of hsdd prevalence \n , this product will be used obviously in women in a broader sense than had been studied so far like others , many will not satisfy the official diagnostic criteria of hsdd , and many will increase the risk of adverse effects or be administering other drugs . \n the concerns with its use without labeling were reemphasized again by speakers who argued that they need flibanserin , but at the same time , it was reported that those who were diagnosed with cancer or in menopause should be excluded from treatment with flibanserin by labeling when sold . \n on june 4 , 2015 , fda called a committee meeting to review the efficacy and safety of flibanserin , and after the meeting , the committee approved flibanserin under the condition that risk management tools should be enforced mandatorily . despite the presence of many problems with fliba...",

    "input": "coronary artery disease ( cad ) is a major public health problem worldwide and the single largest cause of mortality in the united states , responsible for one of every six deaths ( aha heart disease and stroke statistics , 2010 ) . \n cad is caused by atherosclerosis , which is an inflammatory disease that involves multiple cell types , including circulating cells and cells in the vessel wall . despite advances in risk factor management on an epidemiological level , \n various blood markers associated with increased risk for death and cardiovascular endpoints have been identified , but currently very few have been shown to have a diagnostic impact or important clinical implications that would affect patient management . \n therefore , there is a great need for innovative biomarkers that can assess risk for cad , assess activity of the atherosclerotic process , and guide evaluation of therapy . \n several recent studies have suggested that circulating micrornas could be useful as biomarkers for various human disease states , including cancer , acute myocardial infarction [ 47 ] , heart failure , and chronic vascular disease [ 8 , 9 ] . \n micrornas ( mirnas ) are a recently recognized class of short ( 1925  nt ) , single - stranded , noncoding rnas that regulate an array of cellular functions through the degradation and translational repression of mrnas that contain complementary sequences \n .   more than 1000 human mirnas have been identified , and , in tissues , mirnas regulate the expression of genes involved in critical cellular processes , including differentiation , growth , proliferation , and apoptosis . \n importantly , mirnas are now regarded as rheostats that fine - tune expression of proteins involved in just about every process in human cells . \n mirnas have been found in tissues , whole blood , serum , plasma , and other body fluids in a stable form that is protected from endogenous rnase activity [ 3 , 12 ] . \n although the biological function of mirna is yet to be fully understood , tissue levels of specific mirnas have been shown to correlate with pathological development of different diseases . \n mirnas function as managers in gene regulatory networks , and they are distinct from other biomarkers because they have a pathogenic role in the disease process and are not merely byproducts of the disease state . \n thus , mirna expression signatures in tissues and blood have a potential role in the diagnosis , prognosis , and assessment of therapy . in this study \n , we sought to compare mirna expression in whole blood of patients with angiographically significant cad to that of healthy aged - matched controls . \n we performed an initial exploratory microarray analysis in 5 cases and controls and then further examined the most highly expressed mirnas in an additional 15 cases and controls . \n study participants were recruited as part of the emory cardiology biobank , consisting of 3492 consecutive patients enrolled prior to undergoing elective or emergent cardiac catheterization across three emory healthcare sites , between 2003 and 2008 . \n patients aged 2090 years were interviewed to collect demographic characteristics , medical history , and lifestyle habits . \n risk factor prevalence was determined by physician diagnosis and/or treatment for hypertension , hyperlipidemia , and diabetes . \n coronary angiograms were evaluated independently by two operators , who made visual estimation of luminal narrowing in multiple segments based on a modified form of the aha / acc classification of the coronary tree .   using these data , \n significant cad was defined as at least one major epicardial vessel with > 50% stenosis , assessed by quantitative coronary angiography . additionally , we collected whole blood samples from patients with 2 risk factors for cad , but did not have angiographically significant cad . \n the study was approved by the institutional review board at emory university , atlanta , ga , usa .   all subjects provided written informed consent at the time of enrollment . \n the healthy subject cohort was a random sample of employees from emory university who were fully employed , productive people . \n these subjects were aged 18 and older , not taking medications , and had not been hospitalized for at least one year prior to participation . \n venous blood samples were drawn via antecubial venipuncture into paxgene blood rna tubes and stored at 20c within 24 hours before rna extraction . \n mirna was isolated using the preanalytix paxgene mirna isolation kit ( qiagen ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol . \n mirna microarray analysis was performed by asuragen , inc . , which uses the affymetrix manufactured genechip mirna arrays . \n once labeled , the mirna targets were hybridized overnight onto the microarrays following which the arrays were washed and stained using streptavidin - phycoerythrin ( sape ) . \n expression analysis was performed for all small rnas for homo sapiens ( e.g. , mirna , small nuclear rnas like snorna and scarna ) and separately for sanger mirna registry content ( mirbase 11.0 , http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/ ) for homo sapiens . \n mirna reverse transcription was performed using the taqman microrna reverse transcription kit ( applied biosystems ) at 16c for 30 min , 42c for 30  min , and denaturation of the enzyme at 85c for 5  min . \n the rt reaction was performed at 37c for 1 hour followed by 5  min at 95c . \n taqman microrna assays ( applied biosystems ) were performed using the 7500 fast real - time pcr system at the 9600 emulation run mode . \n ct values were converted into copy numbers ( copy no . = 2 ) and normalized to rnu44 . \n unpaired student 's t - tests were used to compare data . a p value < .05 ( two sided ) was considered significant . for analysis of microarray expression data , \n a two- sample t - test was carried out for every gene , followed by multiplicity correction to control the false discovery rate ( fdr ) at  .05 . \n we initially performed expression profiling of all small rnas ( 1770 genes , figure 1 ) in the whole blood samples . \n three mirnas passed the fdr cutoff of 0.05 : mir-584 ( 7.9-fold higher in healthy versus cad patients , p = .000103 , t - test ) , mir-542 - 5p ( 3.9-fold higher in healthy versus cad pts , p = .000168 , t - test ) , and mir-187 * ( 2.77-fold higher in healthy versus cad pts , p = 8.1  10 , t - test ) . \n however , signal intensities for mir-542 - 5p and mir-187 * were very low and not detected in most samples . \n separately , we performed an analysis of sanger registry mirnas ( 848 for homo sapiens ) in the whole blood samples , but none of the mirnas passed the fdr cutoff of 0.05 . \n ten mirnas passed a fdr cutoff of 0.10 , but only one ( mir-129 - 5p , 1.57 fold higher in healthy patients , p = .000044 ) of these mirnas had consistently detectable signal across the 10 blood samples . \n although we were able to detect some differences in whole blood mirna levels between healthy subjects and cad patients ( mir-584 , in particular ) , our microarray data suggest that , similar to other reports , levels of mirnas in the blood are low and microarrays may lack the sensitivity to adequately identify mirnas that might serve as vascular disease biomarkers . \n interestingly , among the mirnas that tended to show consistent differences between healthy and cad blood , mirna expression was generally higher in the blood of healthy subjects , a finding previously observed by others . \n next , we performed qrt - pcr on rna isolated from whole blood of another 10 patients with angiographically significant cad and 15 healthy subjects . \n we evaluated the levels of mirnas that , based on our microarray data , were highly expressed in blood and tended to have different levels of expression between the two groups . \n this analysis included mir-150 , mir-584 , mir-21 , mir-24 , mir-126 , mir-92a , mir-34a , mir-19a , mir-145 , mir-155 , mir-222 , mir-378 , mir-29a , mir-30e-5p , mir-342 , and mir-181d . among these we found that mir-19a , mir-584 , mir-155 , mir-222 , mir-145 , mir-29a , mir-378 , mir-342 , mir-181d , mir-150 , and mir-30e-5p were significantly downregulated in the blood of patients with cad compared to healthy subjects ( figure 2 ) . \n furthermore , we also assessed expression of these 11 mirnas in a cohort of patients who had 2 risk factors for cad , but did not have angiographically significant cad . \n we found that there was no difference in whole blood mirna expression of this latter group compared to that in patients with significant cad ( not shown ) , suggesting that these mirnas are markers for vascular inflammation rather than markers specific for significant cad . \n there has been one report that mirna expression in blood may be influenced by medications .   indeed , one of the mirnas that we found to be downregulated in the blood of patients with cad is mir-155 , which is known to target the at1 receptor . \n therefore , we as...",

smith et al . , 2001 ) . \n however , little is known about the adaptive significance of variation in the materials that wasps use to construct nest envelopes ( hansell 1984 ; wenzel , 1991 ; cole et al . , 2001 ) . \n polybia emaciata is unusual among the polistine wasps because it uses mud , rather than wood pulp or plant fibers , as the main raw material for nest construction ( schremmer , 1984 ) . \n the genus polybia includes 56 described species ; of these , only the other three species in the subgenus pedothoeca , and one species in the subgenus furnariana , share the derived trait of mud nest construction ( richards , 1978 ; jeanne , 1991 ; cooper , 1993 ) . \n no other swarm - founding polistine wasps are known to build primarily mud nests , although small amounts of inorganic material are sometimes incorporated into the nest paper of other species ( wenzel , 1991 ) . \n the nest of p. emaciata is otherwise typical of the genus ( jeanne , 1975 ; wenzel , 1991 ) , being phragmocyttarus ( comprising horizontal layers of comb that are conjoined and enclosed by a continuous envelope ) with a single small entrance hole near the bottom of the nest . \n numbers of adults in mature colonies are relatively small for the genus , ranging from fewer than 100 up to about 500 adults ( richards , 1978 ; chadab , 1979 ; strassmann et al . , 1992 ) . \n polybia emaciata nests are hard and much more durable than most paper nests of similar size and shape ( rau , 1933 ; richards , 1978 ) . \n for example , skutch ( 1971 ) noted that nests of this species in costa rica were unlike paper nests in that they persisted for several years . \n the high durability of p. emaciata construction material suggests that the nest itself may provide greater brood protection than paper nests . \n if so , we hypothesized that the wasps ' defensive responses to vertebrate attacks have changed to take advantage of nest durability . \n we predicted that the nests ' protective properties reduced the need for behavioral defenses by p. emaciata workers , relative to paper - nesting polybia species with similar colony and nest sizes . \n we tested this prediction by disturbing p. emaciata colonies , and comparing the workers ' responses to those of simultaneously observed paper - nesting p. occidentalis colonies in the same location . \n chadab ( 1979 ) surveyed the defensive responses of swarm - founding paper wasps to vertebrate - like disturbances , including tapping on the nest and/or on the supporting vegetation . the most frequently observed response was for dozens to hundreds of workers to rush out onto the nest envelope , sometimes adopting aposematic postures ( see also o'donnell et al . , \n response was seen in the genera angiopolybia , charterginus , leipomeles , parachartergus , polybia , pseudopolybia , and synoeca , and accords with our observations of what appears to be typical epiponine defensive behavior . \n weaker exit - nest responses ( either requiring several taps , or involving fewer wasps ) were seen in species of leipomeles , metapolybia , and protopolybia . \n interspecific variation in mature colony size was not a good predictor of the type of defensive response , as species with colony sizes smaller and larger than p. emaciata performed nest exiting defensive behavior . \n an attack response often coincides with , or quickly follows , the nest exit response and involves workers flying from the nest , striking the intruder , and attempting to sting ( hermann and blum , 1981 ) . \n when paper - using polybia nests are tapped , some of the workers on the nest surface may immediately perform attacks , while large numbers of workers rush out of the nest entrance and stand in alert posture on the envelope ( jeanne , 1981 ; jeanne et al . , 1992 ) . \n further tapping elicits additional attacks . breathing on the nest surface or into the nest results in immediate attack by several to dozens of workers . \n we discuss the possible adaptive significance of deviations from the typical nest exit that have been documented in several paper wasp species , including p. emaciata . \n this study was conducted in and near the town of gamboa , panama province , republic of panama ( 0907n 7942w ; 50 m elevation ) . \n observations and manipulations were conducted during the wet season from 1 august to 15 october 1990 and from 3 to 5 july 1998 . \n surveys of eusocial wasp colonies during these periods indicated that p. emaciata was among the most abundant swarm - founding wasps in terms of nest density ( s.o'd . , unpublished data ) . \n most of the data presented were collected from four colonies of p. emaciata and five colonies of p. occidentalis that had been moved approximately 0.5 km to 1 km from their natural nesting sites to artificial supports to facilitate observation . \n all subject colonies were moved into a small area ( < 0.25 ha ) , with similar amounts of tree cover ( one p. occidentalis colony was additionally sheltered by building eaves ) . \n all colonies were in place at least 2 weeks before observations on defense behavior were initiated , and all continued to forage and to raise brood ( visible through the nest entrance in the lower combs ) throughout the observation period . \n the p. emaciata observation colonies had nests ranging in size from 9 cm long to 22 cm long . \n the numbers of adult wasps and colony age probably varied positively with nest size , though we did not measure these variables . \n we also collected data opportunistically from p. emaciata colonies in situ in 1990 and again in 1998 . \n these nests were located in the gamboa area on thin tree branches from 1.5 m to 5 m above the ground . \n we disturbed p. emaciata and p. occidentalis colonies in an effort to evoke defensive behavior , using stimuli that elicited nest exit and attack responses in costa rican p. occidentalis ( s.o'd . and \n we disturbed the polybia nests by first tapping on the side of the outer envelope near the middle of the nest for 30 sec while wearing a full bee suit , and we noted the responses of on - nest and in - nest workers . \n if there was no attack response to tapping , we blew into the nest entrance for 30 sec . \n each polybia observation colony was disturbed 10 times over the course of the study period in 1990 . \n the in situ nests of p. emaciata were tested once each in a similar fashion . \n we used a non - parametric wilcoxon test for species differences in the probability of immediate attack responses using the four p. emaciata and five p. occidentalis observation colonies . \n trials were pooled within colonies and each colony was used as a single data point in the analysis . \n all observation and in situ polybia colonies contained brood ( larvae and/or pupae were visible in the lower combs ) when they were tested . based on forager traffic and on the numbers of wasps exiting the nests during attacks \n polybia emaciata only rarely ( 5 occasions out of 40 trials on the observation nests and 2 occasions out of > 15 trials on in situ nests ) exhibited a typical polybia attack response within 30 sec when the nest was tapped . \n polybia emaciata workers never rushed out of the nest and onto the nest envelope . in all trials where the wasps did not attack in response to the initial mechanical disturbance ( within the first 30 sec ) , \n some of the workers on the nest surface flew off the nest and departed ; the remainder rapidly entered the nest . \n after the initial disturbance , the nest surface and the lowest layer of comb ( partially visible through the nest entrance , fig . \n breathing into the nest entrance did not elicit rapid ( within 10 sec ) attack responses . \n after continued disturbance within a trial ( breath and tapping ) , p. emaciata workers often attacked violently . in approximately 75% of trials , \n several dozen individuals rapidly exited the nest , took flight , and struck and attempted to sting the observer 's bee veil . \n the p. emaciata nests were not abandoned following these attacks , and workers later returned to the nests . \n in contrast , all 50 nest - tapping trials with p. occidentalis resulted in immediate ( within 1 sec ) exit - nest and attack responses . \n the species difference in the per - colony probability of nest exit and attack within 30 sec of disturbance was significant ( fig . \n 2 ; wilcoxon 2-tailed test , z=2.60 , p<0.01 ) . breathing in or on p. occidentalis nests always elicited immediate attack responses , therefore , habituation...",
    "reference": "the swarm - founding wasp polybia emaciata is unusual among eusocial vespidae because it uses mud , rather than wood pulp , as its primary nest construction material . \n polybia emaciata nests are more durable than similarly sized paper nests . \n we tested the hypothesis that the defensive behavior of this wasp may have been modified to take advantage of their strong nests in defense against vertebrate attacks . \n we simulated vertebrate disturbances by tapping on , and breathing in , p. emaciata nests and similarly sized p. occidentalis paper nests in the same location at the same time . \n polybia emaciata responses to disturbance were qualitatively different from those of p. occidentalis . \n the latter exit the nest and attack , while p. emaciata workers typically fled or entered the nest , attacking only after repeated and extended disturbances . \n we conclude that durable nest material may permit predator avoidance behavior in p. emaciata . \n we compare the defensive responses of p. emaciata workers with those of other swarm - founding vespidae , and discuss several selective forces that could cause the evolution of species variation in nest defense behavior ."

    "input": "human gliomas represent 50% to 60% of all intracranial tumors . according to the world health organization ( who ) guidelines , \n gliomas are histologically classified into four grades : pilocytic astrocytoma ( grade i ) , low - grade diffuse astrocytoma ( grade ii ) , anaplastic astrocytoma ( grade iii ) , and glioblastoma multiforme ( gbm , grade iv ) . both diagnostic technologies and therapeutic strategies \n the 5-year survival rates of low - grade ( grade i~ii ) and high - grade ( grade iii~iv ) glioma patients in china are 75.4% and 18.2% , respectively . \n especially , the median survival time for patients with gbm is still only 12 months . indeed , \n early diagnosis and prolonging survival in glioma patients remains a great challenge for clinicians in the field of neurooncology . \n there have been several prognostic factors for glioma patients , such as age , preoperative duration of symptoms , karnofsky performance status ( kps ) score , histologic grade , tumor necrosis , surgical resection extent , use of postoperative radiation therapy , and , probably , adjuvant chemotherapy . \n however , these clinical parameters can not completely account for the observed variation in survival because of the heterogeneity of glioma patients . \n thus , there is an urgent need to further investigate the molecular mechanisms of glioma and to identify the effective prognostic indicators for survival prediction.the dna - base excision repair ( ber ) pathway is responsible for the repair of exogenous and endogenous alkylating and oxidative dna damage , which may lead to carcinogenesis , cell death , and aging if left unrepaired \n this pathway involves the recognition and removal of damaged bases by a dna glycosylase , followed by incision of the resulting abasic ( ap ) site by ap endonuclease , dna synthesis by polymerase , and strand ligation by dna ligase . \n thus , the ber pathway is an important candidate for intervention into the cellular responses to dna change . \n n - methylpurine - dna glycosylase ( mpg ) as a dna repair enzyme is a main component in the ber pathway . in previous study aimed at understanding the significance of initiating lesions removed by the ber pathway , kaina et al .   identified the over - expression of the human mpg in chinese hamster ovary cells . in the n - alkylpurine repair process , mpg is responsible for the glycolytic removal of the modified base , which leads to the formation of apurinic sites . \n although n - alkylpurines have not been found to be directly mutagenic , apurinic sites left by this repair process can block replication and lead to mutation . \n mpg also participates in the repair of 8-hydroxyguanine and hypoxanthine . because of the potential role of dna base lesions in mutagenesis and carcinogenesis , \n a number of studies have been performed to investigate the association of mpg with various human cancers . \n ( 1998 )   detected the increased mpg gene and protein expression in the breast cancer cells versus normal breast epithelial cells by northern analysis , southern blots , immunofluorescence , immunohistochemistry , and western blot analysis . in 2001 , sohn et al . \n reported that the expression of mpg was increased in high - risk hpv - infected cervical neoplasias and the intracellular distribution of mpg protein was altered , suggesting a role of mpg in carcinogenesis . in an effort to improve the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy by intervening into the cellular responses to chemotherapeutic change , \n many researchers have been interested in the effects of mpg in tumor sensitivity to the clinical chemotherapeutic agents . as their results , mpg - overexpressing ovarian cancer , osteosarcoma , and \n breast cancer   cells are significantly more sensitive to the clinical chemotherapeutic agents , suggesting that the overexpression of mpg may be a possible gene therapy approach to sensitize tumor cells to the cell - killing effects of chemotherapeutic alkylating agents . the biological mechanism behind the increase of sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agents in mpg overexpressing cell lines may be that the balance between glycosylase activity , leading to apurinic sites and formation of strand breaks , and subsequent excision repair processes may play an important role in determining cellular cytotoxicity and resistance to alkylating agents . of our interests , we focus on the involvement of mpg in human gliomas . \n recent study has demonstrated that mpg mrna expression was higher in astrocytic tumor tissues than in brain tissues adjacent to tumor , and mpg protein localization in immunohistochemical study was detected only in the nucleus of all tumor tissues , suggesting an mpg 's role in human astrocytic tumors and raise the possibility that the altered mpg expression and intracellular localization could be associated with astrocytic tumorigenesis . \n tang et al .   further demonstrated that mpg overexpression , together with the inhibition of ber , could sensitize glioma cells to the alkylating agent . \n however , little is known about the expression level of mpg in human gliomas with different clinical grades and its prognostic significance . to address this problem \n , we used quantitative real - time pcr , immunohistochemistry assay , and western blot analysis to investigate the expression pattern of mpg gene and protein in glioma specimens and normal control brain tissues . \n next , we analyzed the relationship between mpg expression and the glioma stage as well as the survival of patients . \n this study was approved by the research ethics committee of the institute for functional neurosurgery p.l.a , tangdu hospital , fourth military medical university , xi'an , p.r . china . written informed consent \n a total of 128 formalin -

    "input": "the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children and adolescents has widely increased worldwide [ 1 , 2 ] , making it one of the most common chronic disorders in this age group and in adulthood . \n the use of body mass index ( bmi ) for age to define being overweight and obese in children and adolescents is well established for both clinical and public health applications , because of their feasibility under clinical settings and in epidemiological studies [ 3 , 4 ] . in children and adolescents , \n the natural increases in bmi that occur with age necessitate the use of age - sex - specific thresholds . \n the most widely used growth charts are the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc-2000 ) , the international task force ( iotf ) , and the 2007 growth references for 5 to 19 year olds produced by the world health organization ( who-2007 ) .   the cdc-2000 growth charts were developed to evaluate the nutritional status of us children and were originated from five cross - sectional representative surveys carried out in the us between 1963 and 1994 . \n these growth charts are routinely applied to identify children and adolescents with a bmi greater than the 85th or 95th percentiles following the advice of the us expert committee on childhood obesity . \n however , the appropriateness of an american dataset for defining overweight in young people from other countries is questionable . \n the iotf reference also uses age - sex - specific bmi percentiles , and overweight and obesity definition corresponds to an adult bmi of 25 and 30  kg / m , respectively , and reflects values in children tracking to overweight and obesity in adults . \n this reference is based on six large international cross - sectional representative datasets , identifying the bmi values that extrapolate to childhood . \n the who-2007 growth references were created to replace the national center for health statistics ( nchs ) references [ 10 , 11 ] . \n this reference was constructed using data from the 1977 nchs / who growth reference ( 1 to 24 years old ) merged with data from the 2006 who child growth standards for preschool children ( under 5 years of age ) using state - of - the - art statistical methods . \n although valuable information has been appearing in the literature or online , such as works from the health behaviour of school - aged children study which is mainly related to social determinants of health and well - being among young people , no systematic review has been conducted to understand the worldwide magnitude of the overweight and obesity problem among the adolescent population . \n thus , the objective of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding the prevalence of overweight and obesity in adolescents ( 1019 years old ) of both sexes published in the past 12 academic years ( 19992011 ) . \n a systematic literature search was performed which ended on june 7 , 2012 ( see figure 1 ) . \n the literature search was conducted in medline and scopus using the following mesh terms :  overweight  ;

evaluation . \n when the patient returned in 4  days , she complained of dark urine , generalized weakness , and increased muscle and skin pain throughout her body . \n she was then found to have rhabdomyolysis , with ck at 58,349  u / l ( > 50 the upper limit of normal ) . \n sacubitril / valsartan was stopped at this time as it was the only new medication in her regimen . \n the ck level decreased steadily and her symptoms resolved over the course of a 5-day hospitalization ( fig .  1 ) . \n her renal function was preserved throughout and her bilirubin and transaminases briefly increased and also subsequently steadily decreased ( figs .  2 , 3 ) . \n barr virus , hepatitis a , herpes simplex virus , hiv , and cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) . \n barr virus , and herpes simplex virus , and had negative hepatitis a and b , hiv , hsv . and cmv tests.fig . \n ast aspartate aminotransferase , alt alanine aminotransferase \n  creatine kinase values during and post hospitalization . \n ast aspartate aminotransferase , alt alanine aminotransferase by 23  days after her initial presentation , the patient no longer had any muscle or skin pain and her ck and liver function test ( lft ) levels were completely normalized . \n the patient has not had any reoccurrence of rhabdomyolysis and elevated transaminases for 46  days , and her bilirubin and transaminase levels also returned to normal ( figs .  2 , 3 ) . \n one week later , the patient was started on an alternate statin at a low dose ( rosuvastatin 5  mg ) and the ck levels and lfts have remained stable . \n this patient had been on a variety of statins for more than 7  years , including atorvastatin , simvastatin , and rosuvastatin . \n her baseline ck and lfts were normal prior to the initiation of sacubitril / valsartan . \n she had previously experienced two transient elevations in ck , to a maximum of 1608 \n u / l , while hospitalized for an implantable defibrillator infection and explanation complicated by an acute chf exacerbation and a recurrent chf exacerbation in the 3  years prior to the current admission . \n her ck levels returned to normal after her acute illnesses , without change in her lfts . in this case , the immediate cause of her rhabdomyolysis was unknown , but the new medication in her profile seemed to be the likely trigger . due to the severity of her rhabdomyolysis \n the naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale score was 5 , making it probable that the adverse drug reaction was precipitated by sacubitril / valsartan . \n the drug interaction probability scale score was 3 , consistent with a possible interaction as a cause for the reaction , with sacubitril / valsartan as the precipitant drug and atorvastatin as the object drug . \n of note , one of the concurrent medications , carvedilol , is a p - glycoprotein inhibitor that may increase the serum concentration of atorvastatin , a p - glycoprotein substrate ; however , the patient was stable on this combination for 7  years before sacubitril / valsartan was initiated . \n none of the other medications taken by this patient are known to cause rhabdomyolysis or an elevation in transaminases . \n a literature search regarding a drug interaction between sacubitril and statins yielded no reports of rhabdomyolysis with statins . \n as per a recent study , coadministration of sacubitril / valsartan with atorvastatin led to a twofold increase in the maximum concentration ( c \n max ) of atorvastatin and its metabolites . \n in addition , the us and canadian package inserts of sacubitril / valsartan cite in vitro data showing sacubitril inhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptides ( oatp ) 1b1 and 1b3 , resulting in increased c \n max and area under the curve ( auc ) of atorvastatin with coadministration of sacubitril / valsartan [ 6 , 7 ] . the canadian version of the product insert further states that sacubitril / valsartan may increase the systemic exposure of oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 substrates , such as statins . \n sacubitril / valsartan increases the c \n max of atorvastatin and its metabolites by up to twofold , and auc by up to 1.3-fold . \n the canadian insert recommends that sacubitril / valsartan must be coadministered cautiously with statins , especially simvastatin , a sensitive oatp1b1/1b3 substrate , and a decrease in dose of simvastatin and atorvastatin may be considered when coadministered with sacubitril / valsartan . \n the interaction between atorvastatin and sacubitril is mentioned in the us product package insert as a theoretical possibility . \n there is currently no recommendation to increase monitoring or empirically decrease the dose of any statin on initiation of sacubitril / valsartan . \n a number of medications are known to inhibit oatps and have been shown to increase statin plasma concentrations . \n many single nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) have been found within the slco1b1 and/or slco1b3 genes encoding oatp1b1 and oatp1b3 proteins , respect...",

old unmarried female patient presented to us with a persistent fistula in the right iliac fossa following an appendicectomy done in another hospital 6 weeks previously . on further questioning , she informed us that she had presented to this hospital with a 2-week history of abdominal pain , confined to the right lower abdomen . \n she complained of general ill health and occasional altered bowel habits for 6 months prior to this acute episode . \n an enquiry with the doctors who had initially seen her revealed that at the time of presentation for acute appendicitis she was quite unwell with fever , tachycardia , and dehydration . \n her abdomen was tender all over with guarding , more pronounced over the right lower half . \n an x - ray of her abdomen showed a few fluid levels and an ultrasound scan revealed free fluid in the abdomen with an associated right iliac fossa mass . \n a diagnosis of pelvic peritonitis secondary to acute appendicitis was made by the physicians , and she was taken up for surgery after adequate resuscitation . \n there was pus in the abdomen with an appendicular mass , and the appendix appeared oedematous , thickened , and congested . \n the abdomen was closed after placing a drain , which was removed on the 3 post - operative day . in spite of antibiotic administration \n she was managed conservatively with antibiotics and anti - inflammatory medication and eventually improved , except for a persistent purulent discharge from the wound . \n she then decided to seek our opinion and was admitted under our care for further investigation and management . \n the appendicular histopathology was retrieved from the previous hospital and revealed transmural inflammation with granulomas suggestive of crohn 's disease . \n a computerized tomography ( ct ) scan of the abdomen carried out in our hospital showed pericaecal collection with an inflammatory mass in front of the caecum ( fig . \n the abdomen was surgically explored through the previous incision after excising the fistula leading into the caecum . an inflammatory mass associated with the caecum was noted . \n the appendicular stump had not healed , and was draining into a cavity which was communicating with the wound , indicating a complex enterocutaneous fistula . a limited right hemicolectomy was carried out and continuity established with a primary anastomosis of macroscopically -

acute appendicitis[15 ] . \n crohn 's disease limited to the appendix usually affects young adults in their 20s and 30s , although it is not limited to this age group and can occur at any age . \n the clinical presentation is variable , with acute right iliac fossa pain suggestive of acute appendicitis in about 85% of patients , and chronic pain and a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa in about 25% of patients . \n when the preoperative diagnosis is acute appendicitis , crohn 's disease should be suspected when an atypical or protracted clinical course is present in a patient prior to the appendicitis , particularly in areas where crohn 's disease is prevalent . \n crohn 's disease is diagnosed by a combination of clinical manifestations and radiological findings including barium studies , showing string strictures , fissures , and fistula in the ileum and caecum . \n recently , gray scale sonography and color doppler - flow features have been used in diagnosing crohn 's disease . when the disease is located atypically in the appendix , \n macroscopically , the appendix will be seen to be enlarged , swollen and adherent to the surrounding structures , these findings being secondary to chronic inflammation . \n histologically , the disease is characterized by transmural inflammation with thickening of the appendiceal wall , epitheloid granulomas , lymphoid aggregates , and mucosal ulceration . \n other histological features are multinucleated giant langherhan 's cells , crypt abscess , neural hyperplasia and lymphangiectasia . \n differential diagnosis includes the presence of foreign bodies and diverticulitis of the appendix , which also give rise to chronic granulomatous inflammation with induration and fibrosis of the appendiceal wall , and granulomatous disease of unknown aetiology such as appendiceal sarcoidosis , which is rare and often accompanies systemic disease . \n differential diagnosis should also include infectious diseases such as tuberculosis , actinomycosis and yersenia infection . \n a rare fungal infection such as histoplasmosis or blastomycosis , or a parasitic infestation such as schistosomiasis or enterobius vermicularis infestation can elicit an appendiceal granulomatous reaction . \n the diagnostic difficulty arises when a patient undergoes an appendicectomy for suspected acute appendicitis and the surgeon unexpectedly encounters ileocaecal pathology whose nature is difficult to ascertain in an emergency situation . in view of this , a definitive treatment in the form of ileocaecal resection for conditions like crohn 's disease may be difficult to carry out . while a frozen section may be helpful to differentiate some of these conditions it may not always be feasible in an emergency situation . if crohn 's disease of the appendix is suspected and is limited to the appendix then appendicectomy alone is a routine surgical procedure with very low intraoperative or postoperative mortality and a low rate of fistula formation.the postoperative enterocutaneous fistula incidence rate in crohn 's disease restricted to appendix alone has been reported to be 3.5% , whereas in patients with crohn 's disease of the ileocaecal segment , as in our patient , the postoperative enterocutaneous rate rises to 34% to 58% . \n weston et al reported that the majority of the patients whose first presentation of crohn 's disease simulates appendicitis and who undergo appendicectomy alone leaving the ileocaecal segment in place to be treated medically , returned postoperatively within 3 yea...",

significant variables were removed in a stepwise manner by elimination when p(f )  0.10 . \n model 1 included the variables : milk intake in quintiles , lct-13910 c > t polymorphism , sex , birth weight , parents height , tanner stage , bmi , and ses . in a first step \n the variable bmi was eliminated and in a second step ses ( table 3 ) . \n milk intake ( g / d ) in quintiles remained significantly different ( =0.46 ; 95% ci : 0.040 , 0.87 and p=0.032 ) in the final model . \n in addition , the lct c > t-13910 polymorphism ( lp vs. lnp ) , remained significant in the final model ( =2.05 ; 95% ci : 0.18 , 3.92 and p=0.032 ) , showing a positive association of lp with height . \n main effect by quintiles of milk intake and lct-13910 c > t ( exposure variables ) on body height in swedish preadolescents and adolescents ( n=542 ) ; stepwise backward multiple linear regression models were used included variables in model 1 : birth weight , sex , mother 's and father 's height . \n bmi , tanner stage , ses excluded variable : bmi ( p[f ]  0.10 ) . excluded variables : ses ( p[f ]  0.10 ) . \n we found that milk intake and lct c > t-13910 polymorphism , known to modulate milk consumption , were significant contributors to the observed variance of body height in the studied population . \n we primarily did not expect to find our hypothesis confirmed in a nutritionally replete country with already one of the highest intakes of milk and dairy products per capita in the world . \n the lct c > t-13910 polymorphism might contribute with a small effect to phenotypic variation in height . \n as far as we know no genome wide association studies or meta - analysis have been performed previously addressing the question whether lp or lnp affects body height . \n increasing evidence suggests that cow 's milk consumption exerts a positive effect on longitudinal growth in preadolescents and adolescents , for instance , by affecting the igf - i - axis ( 8 , 11 , 2730 ) . \n but not all studies show a positive effect of milk on height , especially in nordic countries , where average milk intake per capita traditionally is high ( 31 ) . \n the lct c > t-13910 polymorphism , known to modulate milk intake ( 32 , 33 ) , remained significant in the final model . by including the lct c > \n t-13910 polymorphism in our model , we subtract for hidden heritability in an already predominantly lp population ( 18 ) . in a recent prospective study , evidence of an association between increased infant size at birth and cow milk consumption during pregnancy \n it is known that lp subjects consume on average more milk than lnp subjects . where lp might thus lead to an increased susceptibility towards already prenatally programmed increased body sizes , mediated by the higher capacity of lp mothers to consume milk and dairy products . \n our study accounts for parental height as regards milk intake and its potential effects on body height and growth in preadolescents and adolescents . \n despite the circumstance that body height is a highly heritable complex trait ; corrections for parental height continue to be an exception , also shown in recent studies ( 31 ) . \n even twin growth studies have been performed without consideration of parental height ( 35 ) . \n it has been demonstrated that at the current stage a simple prediction based on phenotype of relatives obviously outperforms sophisticated genomic predictions as regards body height ( 36 ) \n . limitations of this study are the sample size , and the limits inherent to cross - sectional studies as regards causal inference . \n cow 's milk is an evolutionary food constructed to promote growth and development in calves and appears to affect growth in human beings also ( 13 , 14 , 28 ) . \n milk has become a normative food for preadolescents and adolescents beyond weaning age , even in asian populations and developing countries , which traditionally did not have home fare based on domesticated dairy animals ( 8 , 37 ) . \n the long -

    "input": "primary hyperparathyroidism ( php ) is a hypercalcemic disease stemming from an abnormal increase in parathyroid hormone ( pth ) secretion by one or more parathyroid glands . \n the hallmark of this condition is the presence of high levels of calcium and high or inappropriate levels of pth . \n primary hyperparathyroidism is more common in women than in men and increases with aging in both genders . \n the goal of parathyroidectomy is the excision of the abnormal parathyroid gland(s ) , preserving the normal ones in order to achieve and maintain a postoperative normocalcemic state . \n success rates for surgical treatment depend on the skill and experience of the surgeon in finding and recognizing the pathologic changes and excising the correct amount of hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue . \n the surgical treatment of php has undergone substantive changes since the first successful parathyroidectomy was performed by felix mandl in 1925 . \n it is now expected that the vast majority of patients will be cured during initial surgical exploration at a low probability of morbidity . the conventional time - honored operation employing general endotracheal anesthesia and bilateral cervical exploration is safe and effective when performed by experienced surgeons . \n however , recent technical innovations , including improved preoperative localization and availability of rapid intraoperative pth assays ( iopth ) , have yielded focused approaches with excellent outcomes . \n sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by a single enlarged parathyroid gland ( parathyroid adenoma ) in approximately 85% of the cases , whereas multigland hyperplasia occurs in 15% and parathyroid carcinoma is found in less than 1% of patients . unlike the previous dogma that required surgical identification of both enlarged and normal parathyroid glands , the current paradigm in many centers is to identify and excise the incident enlarged gland and to confirm operative cure , employing a rapid intraoperative pth assay . due to the relatively short half - life of pth ( 4 - 5  min ) , \n a dramatic drop in circulating hormone can be detected once the abnormally secreting gland or glands have been removed . \n a curative drop in pth allows the surgeon to terminate the operation and obviate additional exploration , whereas failure of the pth levels to demonstrate an adequate decrement asks for additional exploration because of the presence of presumed additional hypersecreting gland(s ) . \n the aim of the present study was to evaluate our 10-year experience in employing a rapid intraoperative pth assay for php . \n this is a prospective study on a cohort of operated patients treated at a university referral center . \n this investigation was approved by the unifesp / epm ethics committee . from june 2000 to april 2011 , 96 surgeries for php were performed at hospital so paulo unifesp / epm , so paulo , brazil . \n these 96 procedures were performed in 91 previous unexplored patients who had at least 6 months of postoperative follow - up with enough reported data to be eligible for the study . \n the php diagnoses were established in the presence of high levels of calcium and high or inappropriate levels of pth . \n all patients had their age , gender , symptoms ( bone and kidney ) , preoperative localization tests , serum ionized calcium ( ica ) , serum total calcium and intact pth recorded before parathyroidectomy , as well as iopth dosages . \n the laboratorial tests were repeated 1 month , 6 months , and in 1-year increments after surgery . \n a series of 91 consecutive patients with primary hyperparathyroidism underwent parathyroidectomy guided by intraoperative pth at federal university of so paulo , brazil , from june 2000 to april 2011 . focused parathyroidectomy guided by intraoperative pth was the initial procedure when preoperative localization tests were positive and when there were no suspicion of malignant disease . \n a bilateral cervical exploration guided by intraoperative pth was performed when preoperative localization tests were negative . \n a baseline peripheral venous blood sample was obtained just after anesthesia induction as well as 10 minutes after the abnormal parathyroid tissue removal . \n the intraoperative criterion used to predict successful parathyroidectomy was a decrease in the intact pth levels exceeding 50% from the preincision hormone level . \n if this criterion was met , surgical exploration of the neck would be completed and the incision closed . \n otherwise , further surgical exploration of the neck would have to be carried on . \n intraoperative pth was measured using elecsys pth immunoassay ( elecsys 1010 system , roche , mannheim , germany ) . \n the test is an immunometric assay based on monoclonal antibodies , magnetic particles as solid phase , and ruthenium complex as chemiluminescent label . \n total time to perform the assay is 9 minutes ; reference values are 1065  pg / ml . to validate the rapid pth assay , 170 samples from the study \n the iopth accuracy calculation was based on the following definitions : a true - positive ( tp ) result of iopth was defined as the correct prediction of postoperative normal calcium levels for at least 6 months ; true negative ( tn ) was the correct prediction of incomplete excision by either resection of an additional gland(s ) or operative failure ; false positive ( fp ) was the incorrect prediction of normocalcemia with subsequent postoperative persistent hypercalcemia and high pth levels ; false negative ( fn ) was the incorrect prediction of incomplete excision followed by postoperative normocalcemia . \n persistent disease was considered when serum calcium and pth levels remained above normal range just after surgery . \n recurrence was defined when , after reaching normocalcemic levels , serum calcium and intact pth measurements start to rise to abnormal values at least 6 months after surgery . \n serum ionized calcium ( 1.151.32  mmol / l ) , serum total calcium ( 8.510.5  mg / dl ) and intact pth ( 1167  pg / ml ) , were measured using standard automatic assays . \n the demographic , clinical , and biochemical aspects of 91 patients with php are shown in table 1 . among all cohort of 91 patients , 69 ( 75.8% ) had solitary adenoma , 10 ( 11.0% ) had multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 ( men1 ) , 6 ( 6.6% ) had double adenomas , 4 ( 4.4% ) had carcinomas , and 2 ( 2.2% ) patients are still waiting for remedial surgery for multiglandular disease ( mgd ) , 1 of whom had recurrence disease after 10 years of follow - up and the other persistent disease after a false positive iopth ( table 2 ) . \n we had 85 ( 93.4% ) successful parathyroidectomies 6 ( 6.6% ) failed parathyroidectomies in 91 previous unexplored patients , and 5 ( 100% ) successful remedial surgeries . among the 85 successful patients , \n 69 ( 81.2% ) had solitary adenoma , 3 ( 3.5% ) had carcinoma , 4 ( 4.7% ) had double adenomas , 8 ( 9.4% ) had men1 , and 1 ( 1.2% ) still has mgd ( table 2 ) . \n the mean decay of iopth in the successful group of patients was 80.5% ( 34.3% to 96.0% ) . in these 85 patients \n , we had 80 tp results ( 67 adenomas , 3 carcinomas , 8 men1 and 2 recurrences \n we also had 3 cases of double adenoma in which the iopth resulted in a tn value , requiring additional exploration to prevent persistent disease ( table 2 ) . \n there were only 2 fn results among the successful group patients ( table 4 ) . \n the mean decay of iopth in the 80 patients with tp results was 81.7% , with a minimum drop of 55.0% ( 55.0% to 96.0% ) . \n operative failure of the initial surgery occurred in 6 patients : 2 double adenoma , 2 men1 , 1 carcinoma , and 1 mgd who is still waiting for remedial surgery ( table 5 ) . \n both cases of double adenoma had a tn decay of iopth , but the second adenoma wasnot found during the initial operation . with the aid of new localization exams , \n successful remedial operations were performed with an iopth tp result . the patient with parathyroid carcinoma developed hypercalcemia and high levels of pth two months after surgery . in search of distant metastasis , this patient underwent a pulmonary computerized tomography and multiple pulmonary nodules were found . \n for this reason , she was classified as iopth false - positive . in both men1 patients , \n one patient already had men1 diagnosis at the time of initial surgery and we failed to find the fourth gland . \n the other patient was first operated as a solitary adenoma and men1 diagnosis surfaced just in the follow - up . \n there was only one case in the operative failure patients ;

bolic control may worsen depressive symptoms ( 5 ) , and the relationship appears to be bidirectional ( 8) . the prevalence of these comorbidities and their potential to worsen disease management have led some to develop interventions designed to address comorbid depressive symptoms or stress in persons with diabetes ( 1214 ) . \n while many studies have documented the cross - sectional presence of these comorbidities and the effect on glycemic control in subjects with diabetes , only a limited number of studies have examined the potential impact on cv outcomes . \n most of these studies have been limited to patients with depression recruited from established health care settings , and the true population - level impact is unknown . \n likewise , there has not been adequate comparison of individuals with and without diabetes who have concurrent depressive symptoms and/or elevated levels of perceived stress to examine the unique consequences of behavioral and medical comorbidity . \n the objective of the present report was to examine the association between the presence of depressive symptoms and/or increased levels of perceived stress , determined at baseline , and risk of incident cv events over 5 years of follow -

home visit by a trained health professional 34 weeks after the telephone interview . \n height and weight was measured via standard procedures , and bmi was computed as the body weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters ( 2 ) . \n all ecgs were read by a trained cardiologist in a centralized ecg reading laboratory at the wake forest university / baptist medical center in winston -

induced type of ss . as mentioned earlier , \n there have , however , been reports of the occurrence of ss localized to specific sites of the body though , some of which have presented with very unusual morphologic patterns , as shown by sommer et al . who described palmoplantar pustulosis as the sole finding in a ss patient , verma et al . demonstrating the occurrence of ss confined to the photo exposed sites alone , verma who elucidated a rare recurrent bullous eruption localized to the flexural aspect of both the forearms in a ss patient and brechtel et al . who reported a localized facial presentation of ss manifesting as an inflammatory lesion with a central depression superimposed with several pustules on the surface of the plaque . \n a variant of ss referred to as neutrophilic dermatosis of the dorsal hands ( nddh ) is a specific entity confined only to the dorsa of the hands and has been extensively reviewed in literature by galaria et al . , takahama and kanbe , cook et al . \n nddh usually presents as edematous and violaceous plaques and papulonodules on the radial aspect of the dorsal surface of both hands . \n our patient presented with molluscoid pseudovesicles distributed over the neck and forearms only , which is a very rare morphologic pattern witnessed in ss and to the best of our knowledge has not been previously described . \n second , our patient lacked the usual constitutional symptoms that herald ss , which made the diagnosis a challenge . \n third , as no systemic association with ss could be identified in our patient , he was further sub -

    "input": "in order to prevent and control microbial proliferation in industrial settings , cleaning and disinfection plans are applied on a regular basis [ 1 , 2 ] . in food processing plants , \n the control of microbial contamination generally involves clean - in - place ( cip ) procedures which consist of running alternated cycles of detergent and disinfectant solutions with water rinses in high turbulence regimes through the plant and pipeline circuits without dismantling or opening the equipment [ 25 ] . \n biocides are currently used in industrial processes as the most significant countermeasure to control microbial growth and proliferation . \n industry moved progressively towards the use of surfactants that are less toxic and more biodegradable . \n surfactants are classified according to the ionic physiognomies of their hydrophilic group as anionic , cationic , nonionic , and zwitterionic [ 6 , 8 ] . \n quaternary ammonium compounds ( qacs ) are cationic surfactants that are commonly used because of their hard - surface cleaning , odor removal and antimicrobial properties . besides killing bacteria , the chemical nature of qacs can cause modifications on the properties of abiotic surfaces , decreasing their tension and therefore preventing attachment of microorganisms . \n the antimicrobial mode of action of cationic surfactants is proposed by some authors as a sequence of events : attraction by the negatively charged cell surface ; adsorption to the cell wall through the hydrophobic headgroup ; reaction with the lipids and proteins that compose the cytoplasmic membrane ; and cell penetration and interaction with intracellular constituents [ 10 , 11 ] . \n thus , qacs damage the outer layers of bacteria , thereby promoting the release of intracellular constituents . \n antimicrobial efficacy tests require planning of an adequate strategy and should include all the parameters found in real settings . \n aspects such as the proper contact time under known water hardness and conditions of high or low soil content should be considered . for an effective cleaning and disinfection plan \n , the choice of the disinfectant must follow specific criteria such as compatibility with the surfaces to be disinfected , economic constraints , safety in the workplace , toxicological safety , and biological degradability . \n it should , most of all , target the type of bacteria and the type of soiling . \n in fact , disinfectants can be seriously affected by the presence of organic matter . \n interfering substances have been studied in the last years and included in cleaning and disinfection plans regulated by the authorities such as the european standard en-1276 . \n however , most of these studies only address the effects of bovine serum albumin ( bsa ) and water hardness [ 9 , 14 , 15 , 1921 ] . \n evaluated the bactericidal activity of disinfectants referred in the german veterinary society guidelines as references for testing disinfectants used in dairy and food industries . in order to simulate the conditions found in practice , they used low fat milk as an organic load and reported the significance in choosing an appropriate disinfectant since the inclusion of a challenging substance ( organic material ) is important to access the proper bactericidal activity . \n bessems   demonstrated that a qac tested on three microorganisms ( pseudomonas aeruginosa , staphylococcus aureus , and candida albicans ) had a similar killing rate in the absence of interfering substances and after the inclusion of 17  dh water hardness , a strong reduction of the killing activity was found for the gram - negative bacteria \n assessed the effect of dried yeast and human serum on the activity of benzalkonium chloride and concluded that the bactericidal activity of the qac was inhibited by solutions of both interfering substances . \n this work provides information on the influence of potential interfering substances ( bovine serum albumin \n ha ) on the antimicrobial activity of two qacs ( benzalkonium chloride and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ) against bacillus cereus and pseudomonas fluorescens , as they are two major contaminants in the food industry , particularly the dairy industry , and are a known cause of produce spoilage and foodborne illnesses [ 2 , 2226 ] . \n some of the interfering substances used throughout the experiments are proposed in the european standard en-1276   as potential interfering agents in disinfection while the others are extracellular polymeric substances ( eps ) from the biofilm matrix that have an important role in antimicrobial resistance . \n the bacteria used in this work were pseudomonas fluorescens atcc  13525 and a bacillus cereus strain , isolated from a disinfectant solution and identified by 16s rrna gene sequencing . \n bacterial strains were grown at a temperature of 30  2c and ph 7 , with glucose as the main carbon source . \n culture medium consisted of 5  gl glucose , 2.5  gl peptone , and 1.25  gl yeast extract in phosphate buffer ( pb ) ( ph 7 , 0.025  m ) . a bacterial suspension was prepared by inoculation of a single colony grown on solid medium into a 1  l flask containing 250  ml of sterile nutrient medium . \n this bacterial suspension was incubated overnight at the given temperature with agitation ( 120  rpm ) . \n the qacs used throughout the experiments were benzalkonium chloride ( bac ) and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide ( ctab ) ( sigma , portugal ) . \n preliminary studies with a concentration range between 0 and 5000  mgl were initially made . in order to ascertain the behaviour of bacteria to the qac , \n the selected concentrations for further studies were 3 , 5 , 10 , 20 , and 35  mgl . \n the qacs were used individually and in combination ( both chemicals were combined in equal volumes and concentrations ) . \n ha ( acros organics , fisher chemical , portugal ) , and yeast extract  ye ( merck , portugal ) . \n after the growth period , the suspensions were centrifuged ( 3999  g , 5 minutes ) , washed two times , and resuspended in pb to a final cell density of approximately 1  10  cellsml . in the case of the consortium , \n both bacterial suspensions were washed two times resuspended in pb to a final cell density of approximately 1  10  cellsml , and combined in equal volumes to obtain the same cell concentrations of the single species tests . \n afterwards , all bacterial suspensions were exposed to several concentrations of qac for a period of 30 minutes . \n the effects of the chemicals were evaluated by the assessment of the oxygen uptake rate due to glucose oxidation , according to simes et al . . \n to investigate the influence of interfering substances on the antimicrobial efficacy , the same procedure was followed with the addition of 300  mgl of bsa , alg , ye , or ha to the bacterial suspension , simulating low concentrations of interfering substances according to the european standard en-1276 . three independent experiments , each with duplicate samples , were performed for each condition tested . \n the methodology was performed according to johnston et al .   for a period of 10 minutes . \n bac and ctab were chemically neutralized by a sterile solution of ( w / v ) 0.1% peptone , 0.5% tween 80 , 0.1% sodium thiosulphate , and 0.07% lecithin dissolved in pb . \n control experiments were performed to ascertain the effects of the 10-minute exposure to the neutralization solution , and no effects were detected on the respiratory activity of b. cereus and p. fluorescens ( data not shown ) . \n after the neutralization step , the bacterial suspensions were centrifuged ( 3999  g , 5  min ) and resuspended in the same volume of pb . \n the respiratory activity was ascertained by measuring oxygen uptake rates in a biological oxygen monitor ( yellow springs instruments 5300a ) . \n demonstrated that this procedure is more adequate and rapid than the assessment of colony forming units to characterize the antimicrobial activity of biocides against heterotrophic aerobic bacteria . \n samples were placed in the temperature -

    "input": "social scientists who explore factors mediating and moderating the relationships between social stressors and mental health , including drinking outcomes , have highlighted modes of coping [ 1 , 2 ] . these studies have explored behaviors which protect people from being psychologically harmed   and cognitive appraisals which influence behaviors such as problem - focused coping   or using alcohol to self - medicate distress . \n however , studies have not considered the characteristics of the stressful situation itself that may make certain coping strategies more or less effective . in particular , \n psychiatric epidemiologic studies have tended to emphasize microlevel stressors ( e.g. , stressors in individuals ' role domains ) and , until recently , have ignored the linkages between macrolevel social forces and the daily stressors in people 's lives [ 79 ] . \n however , macrolevel social conditions can affect the magnitude of stressors experienced in people 's lives and the extent to which they experience  cumulative adversity  . \n this paper focuses on coping with the fallout from one type of macrolevel social stressor : the recent great recession . \n this economic downturn constituted the most severe economic crisis in the united states since the great depression   and had persisting economic effects ( e.g. , job loss , less desirable working conditions , loss of home , loss of retirement savings , lack of health care access , and social isolation ) which have been linked with deleterious drinking outcomes . \n a key issue involving the effectiveness of alternative modes of coping with stressors derived from macrolevel social forces and protecting against deleterious drinking outcomes is the question of whether individual modes of coping outside of the political realm emphasized in the overall coping literature are most efficacious . or , alternatively , do stressors engendered by macrolevel social forces require unique forms of coping , that encompass the political realm ? \n with respect to coping strategies employed in the wake of the great recession , politically oriented coping strategies might be of particular relevance due to the impact of governmental decision - making on the state of the economy . \n politically oriented coping strategies might include political activism oriented to altering economic policies or support for campaigns by politicians offering solutions to economically based hardships . scholarly work on the occupy wall street movement , for example , documents involvement by individuals sharing their own economic struggles   and collectively gathering to protest their precarious economic situation and uncertain economic future . \n earlier work also suggests the salience of activities oriented toward changing politically based social realities such as through the act of voting   or by collectively challenging community - level decisions such as school closings . \n by contrast , the traditional coping literature has emphasized individual , nonpolitical modes of coping , such as emotional acceptance of the stressful situation , blaming one 's self for the situation , or taking individual actions such as looking for a job if unemployed . \n while sociologists have recently accorded greater attention to the prevalence and alcohol - related consequences of macrolevel stressors , they have yet to address the extent to which politically oriented modes of coping may be the most efficacious ways to address problems stemming from macrolevel social forces or events . prior to the more recent focus on macrolevel stressors , kaplan and liu   embraced the idea of collective coping as one means for individuals who maintained stigmatized personal identities to challenge and transform conventional socionormative systems through participation in social movements . \n subsequently , thoits   more explicitly addressed collective coping within the context of the stress paradigm involving acute and chronic stressors not limited to the specific area of stigmatized statuses . \n she argued that individuals who find themselves in problematic situations can deliberately work to transform the meaning of their experiences and they can additionally use these experiences  as a basis for helping or effecting changes in the lives of others \n she proposed the concept of  transformatory coping  to include engagement in collective activist activities with others who share similar problems . \n for example , parents of autistic children have lobbied governments for social services perceived to aid in their children 's development . in sum , ( 1 ) collective coping tactics ( such as politically oriented coping ) represent an unmeasured dimension of coping behaviors beyond that represented in the coping literature to date and ( 2 ) collective coping tactics may demonstrate a stronger association between stressors , particularly those stemming from macrolevel social forces , and deleterious drinking outcomes compared to the use of modes of coping previously emphasized in the literature on coping . \n the present study extends previous work by empirically addressing the extent to which politically oriented coping activities engaged in as a response to a macrolevel social stressor , the great recession , are protective against alcohol - related outcomes compared with coping strategies focused outside of the political realm . \n we hypothesize that politically oriented coping will be more protective against economic stressors linked with the great recession than nonpolitical modes of coping and will uniquely account for some portion of the associations between economy - related stressors and drinking outcomes . \n further , we also examine whether politically oriented coping and coping outside of the political realm are more protective for men versus women in the face of macrolevel engendered stressors such as those involving the economic fallout from the great recession . \n there is consistent evidence that women are more likely to use support - based coping strategies ( e.g. , seeking support from others such as partner family and friends ) in response to stress in contrast to men and some indication that avoidant coping techniques are associated with greater alcohol consumption among men but not women [ 1 , 2022 ] . \n ( in contrast , parity by gender in the use of individual active coping strategies and their significance for mental health outcomes is generally reported [ 1 , 21 ] . ) however , whether there is a corresponding propensity for men and women to differ in the use of politically oriented coping to offset the alcohol - related effects of economy - related stressors is less certain . \n earlier research tended to argue that women were less politically interested , informed , and efficacious compared to men . \n more recent work has shown that women and men differ in particular modes of participation ; women are more likely to vote and engage in individual political actions such as signing petitions or donating money , whereas men are more likely to be engaged in collective forms of action such as group protest activities . \n thus , we hypothesize that there will be no overall differences in the extent to which women and men manifest politically oriented coping or in the effect that politically oriented coping has on drinking outcomes . following a transactional model of stress \n [ 4 , 25 ] , we model coping as a mediator of the relationship between the stressor ( i.e. , stressful consequences of the great recession ) and the stress response ( i.e. , drinking outcomes ) . \n data were derived from a study conducted in the united states between june , 2010 , and january , 2011 , that was undertaken in order to understand life change consequences of the major downturn in the economy known as the great recession . \n respondents were selected by a random digit dial ( rdd ) phone survey of the continental united states , and those who consented to participate in the study were mailed questionnaires . \n eligible respondents were selected from the households using the troldahl -

    "input": "the development of titanium fixtures has brought several benefits for the rehabilitation of edentulous patients . when biological and mechanical principles are respected \n , this treatment modality may successfully restore the functional and esthetic impairments caused by tooth loss3 . in spite of the significant evolution of a number of implant systems , implant design and features , such as those related to the mechanical behavior of implant - supported prostheses , \n dental prostheses do fail during function mainly due to abutment and prosthesis screw loosening and/or fracture . \n in addition , it has been reported that abutment screw loosening is only surpassed by loss of osseointegration as the main cause of failure on implant - supported restorations , as shown in longitudinal follow - up studies5 . when two metal surfaces are in contact , adhesion and friction forces do limit the movement between them . \n an applied method aimed to reduce this friction and improve adhesion consists of interposing a lubricating film between these surfaces . \n a metal with low shear strength , such as pure gold , may act as a dry lubricant . \n when compared to screws without gold coating , it has been found that gold - coated abutment screws subjected to torques of 12 , 20 , and 32 ncm aiming a 0.0064 mm opening of the implant - abutment interface presented 26 , 24 , and 24% of preload increase , respectively7 . in another study , it was found that when a torque force is applied to an abutment screw , a significant part of this force is lost due to friction between the contact points of metal surfaces , inhibiting the rotation of the screw . \n thus , decreasing of friction between metallic surfaces may increase the screw rotation and , consequently , the preload . \n the rotation of gold - coated abutment screws placed with torque forces of 12 , 20 , and 32 ncm increased 73 , 76 , and 62% , respectively , when compared to titanium abutment screws2 . \n the purpose of this study was to evaluate by strain gauges the preload and torque removal values on three abutment screws ( gold , titanium , and titanium with surface treatment screws ) applying an equivalent torque force ( 30.070.28 ncm ) . \n three machined self - tapping external hex titanium screws with 4 mm in diameter and 15 mm in length were used in this investigation ( master screw , conexo sistemas de prtese ltda . \n three transmucosal cera one type abutments ( 2.0 mm height , cera one , conexo sistemas de prtese ltda . , \n reference 045022 , batch # 5080915121 ) , designed for cemented single standing implant - supported restorations were also used . \n the transmucosal abutments were attached to the fixtures using 10 gold screws ( conexo , sistemas de prtese ltda . \n , reference 121022 , batch # 5073147 ) ( figure 1 a a ) , 10 titanium screws ( conexo sistemas de prtese ltda . \n , reference 121024 , batch # 5063223 ) ( figure 1a b ) , and 10 surface treated titanium screws ( ti - tite , conexo sistemas de prtese ltda . , reference 121026 , batch # 5063035 ) ( figure 1a c ) . a load cell adapted from a model described in the literature \n this load cell presented a central void for fixture fixation in its upper portion and a horizontal plate for fixation of four strain gauges on its lower portion ( figure 1 b ) . \n the abutments were placed on the upper plate of the cell ( figure 1 c ) in such way that the contact between abutments and fixtures was free of any interference . \n therefore , when the abutment was fixed to the fixture by the abutment screw , tensions generated by this fixation pulled the unit against the abutment , producing a deformation in the lower plate connected to the strain gauges . \n next , the force ( preload ) generated on the abutment screws was captured by the strain gauges in volts ( v ) and later converted to newton ( n ) . \n the aforementioned sample was arranged into 3 different groups according to the characteristics of each abutment screw : group a was formed by gold screws , group b was formed by titanium screws , and group c was formed by surface - treated titanium screws . to determine fixation and removal torques , \n a digital torquemeter was used ( torqueleader , model tsd150 , type i , class e , part # 117317 ) , previously calibrated according with iso 6789:2003 ( e ) standard . a square hand wrench ( 1.27 mm diameter , conexo , \n , reference 062300 , batch # 5091632 ) was attached to the torquemeter to allow proper connection between torquemeter and screws ( figure 1 d ) . following the proper assembly of fixture and abutment on group a \n , the gold screw was then attached to the fixture with an applied torque force of 30.070.28 ncm , being repeated afterwards for groups b and c. then , the initial preload value for the abutment screws was determined ( in volts ) and all screws were kept in their positions for 5 minutes for preload stabilization , according to the literature9 . during this the preload stabilization period , \n preload values were obtained after 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 5 minutes after fixation , and thereafter a mean value was calculated . \n after this evaluation , the abutment screw was removed using a digital torquemeter and the maximum value of reverse torque force required for screw removal was recorded in ncm . \n next , the same screw was fixed again another 4 times , obtaining the preload and torque removal mean values . \n nine other screws from group a as well as 10 other screws from b and c groups were subjected to the same procedure described above . \n the values of fixation torque forces of the 3 groups were analyzed statistically by to one - way analysis of variance ( anova ) . \n comparison of preload values within groups was possible using the mean of 6 measurements ( 0 to 5 minutes ) obtained at the first abutment fixation , using two - way anova . \n one - way anova was used to compare the mean preload values among the groups . \n tukey 's test was used for multiple comparisons among the groups . for all statistical tests , \n all fixations for each screw ( n=5 ) were considered for evaluation of the torque removal to obtain an average value , and the statistical analysis was performed similarly to the preload data . \n two - way anova was used to evaluate the mean torque removal among the groups , and one - way anova to evaluate the differences between screws . \n tukey 's multiple comparison test was used for individual comparisons among the groups . for all statistical tests , \n the mean fixation torque force when all screws were considered was 30.070.28 ncm ( c.i . \n there were no statistically significant differences ( p=0.1244 ) among the groups regarding the fixation torque . \n the gold screws presented the highest preload values and the titanium screws the lowest values ( figure 2 ) . \n the mean preload values of the gold screws was 131.728.98 n , and presented statistically significant differences ( p<0.01 ) compared to groups \n b and c. screw # 3 and screw # 1 presented the highest ( 140.48 n ) and the lowest ( 117.73 n ) preload values , respectively . the titanium screws presented statistically significant differences ( p<0.01 ) ( mean 37.035.69 n ) . \n the highest preload value was obtained for screw # 7 ( 49.68 n ) , while screw # 3 presented the lowest value ( 25.30 n ) . in the group of surface - treated titanium screws , \n the mean preload value was 97.784.68 n. statistically significant differences ( p<0.01 ) were also observed in this group , ( maximum : 104.09 n for screw # 4 ; minimum : 90.28 n for screw # 2 ) . the removal torque presented statistically significant differences among the analyzed materials ( p<0.001 ) ( figure 3 ) . \n the gold screws presented a mean removal torque of 17.641.12 ncm , i.e. they did not shown statistically significant differences ( p=0.3713 ) . \n titanium screws presented a mean removal torque of 18.751.89 ncm , and showed statistically significant differences ( p<0.001 ) . \n the group of surface - treated titanium screws present statistically significant difference ( p=0.004 ) ( mean : 16.431.33 ncm ) . \n the results of this study are similar to those of previous investigations4,8 , which found statistically higher preload values for gold fixation screws in comparison to other tested materials , in spite of using different methodologies and materials . \n a maximum preload value of 666.4 n for gold screws and 458.2 n for titanium screws was reported8 . \n in addition , the finds of the present study suggest that the evaluated surface treatment of titanium screws was effective , since these screws presented higher preload values than conventional titanium screws . \n most previously published reports in the dental literature do not specify the removal torque of abutment screws . \n the effect of different cyclic loads has been evaluated using a 32 ncm torque for fixation of the screws , which was repeated after 10 minutes to avoid contact relaxation6 . \n several manufacturers have...",

lately , subverting its function and causing peripheral neuropathies and neurocognitive disorders ; and lastly , during the final stage of neuroaids , triggering opportunistic cns infections , cancers , and dementia ( tardieu and boutet , 2002 ) . \n highly active antiretroviral therapy ( haart ) , a combination of drugs that inhibits enzymes essential for hiv replication , can reduce the viremia and the onset of opportunistic infections in most patients , and prolong the survival ( see table 1 ) . \n although haart has reduced the incidence of clinical signs of neurological disease in hiv - infected individuals , autopsy studies suggest that there has been no corresponding decline in the incidence of inflammatory lesions in the cns . \n haart currently in use in the clinical practice . among the limits of the current treatments \n the most noticeable is the inability to eradicate hiv - infected cells , both , limiting the time frame in which haart initiated after exposure to hiv can prevent infection , and allowing replication - competent virus that persists in infected cells to emerge rapidly after the cessation of haart . according to those considerations \n , there is evidence that haart is less effective in lowering virus replication in the cns than in the blood ( gisolf et al . , 2000 ) ; and haart resistant viruses are more often found in the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) than in biological samples ( cinque et al . , \n the principal challenges in drug development for cns  hiv infections are : ( 1 ) understanding the pathways for viral entry , replication , reservoirs , and glial activation in order to identify new targets for treatment , ( 2 ) developing selective therapeutics agents for those targets , or shaping effective strategies to deliver them within the cns , and finally but not to underestimate ( 3 ) collaborating with pharmaceutical companies to test promising drugs in clinical trials , and eventually exploit them in clinical practice . \n hiv is known to productively replicate in macrophages and microglia of the cns , but it also infects , via a cd4-independent pathway , macroglial cells such as astrocytes and most - importantly brain microvascular endothelial cells , which represent the major component of the blood brain barrier ( bbb ; bissel and wiley , 2004 ) . although it is generally accepted that neurons do not become infected by hiv , recent reports have shown that neuronal progenitor brain cells can be infected by various viral strains ( i.e. , hiv-1 ) , eventually playing a role as viral reservoirs ( lawrence et al . , 2004 ) . moreover , one of the important features of cns infection is that its viral populations can diverge from those of plasma : indeed , genetic compartmentalization of csf hiv-1 infection has been nicely demonstrated in a series of studies using the heteroduplex tracking essay to compare blood and csf viral populations cross - sectionally and longitudinally ( ritola et al . , 2005 ) ; therefore even if during acute infection the two population are identical , during chronic infection and especially in cases of hiv encephalitis they genetically and functionally diverge , and may justify the failure of antiretroviral therapy ( strain et al . , 2005 ) . \n identification of viral and cellular mechanisms in the cns that control virus replication after acute infection , maintain latency during the asymptomatic stage , and mediate resurgence of virus replication and development of hiv - associated encephalitis during late infection , is critical . \n the dynamic signaling pathways that are activated by virus replication and active / infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes and the cytokines , chemokines , and neurotoxic products they elaborate may interfere with the homeostatic signaling pathways that maintain normal quiescent brain function . to understand the correlates in terms of neuroprotection , neuroinflammation , and neurodegeneration processes \n many preclinical models have been developed , such as : hiv transgenic rat ( i.e. , tg rat from reid et al . , 2001 ) , or mice ( i.e. , gp 120 tg mice from toggas et al . , 1994 ) , but also those obtained by injection of hiv proteins ( i.e. , gp 120 from sundar et al . , 1991 ; or tat and bansal et al . , 2000 ) , or hiv - infected macrophages into the brain of mice ( anderson et al . , 2003 ) \n the most studied signaling pathways include , among others , the gsk3 , cdk5 , erk , notch , p38 , and jnk cascades . \n for instance , it is noteworthy that many mitogen - activated protein kinases are pivotal during acute , asymptomatic , and terminal infection : some of them seems to promote cell growth and differentiation in response to initial infection ( i.e. , erk ) , whereas others are associated to growth arrest , apoptosis , and oncogenic transformation during aids . \n cns infection : in contrast to hiv - infected cd4 + t cells , infection in brain macrophages and microglial cell lines leads to an extended life span and elevated survival against apoptotic stresses ( chugh et al . , 2007 ) , and only during terminal infection , \n when there is resurgent virus replication , the balance favors neuronal death ( i.e. , via activation of jnk and p38 ) reflecting a failure to maintain homeostasis in the cns ( barber et al . , 2004 ) with the consequent motor and cognitive impairments . \n many strategies are currently under evaluation to improve hiv treatment , but a relatively small number are primarily dedicated to the alleviation of neurological complaints or the control of neuroaids , and unfortunately more than 98% of drug candidates for cns disorders never make it to the clinic ( pardridge , 2003 ) . \n herein are a couple of examples picturing how researches , initially conducted for neoplastic , neurodegenerative , or epileptic disorders , on specific pathways and delivery systems , might be adapted and applied to the field of cns  hiv infection ( see figure 1 ) . \n neutralization of vif on microvascular endothelial cells ( ifn and ifn ) and subsequent inhibition of viral entry into the cns ;

    "input": "acute occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery ( sma ) causes extensive intestinal necrosis due to the difficulty of early diagnosis , resulting in poor prognosis , with a high postoperative mortality rate of 65.2% . \n recent reports indicate that selective thrombolytic therapy with intraarterial infusion of urokinase is effective for acute sma occlusion diagnosed early after onset . \n early thrombolytic therapy can not always induce complete thrombolysis , and even if intestinal necrosis is avoided by administration of initial thrombolytic therapy , indications for additional thrombolytic therapy or the method for monitoring intestinal viability during subsequent follow - up have not been established . in this report , we present a case of acute sma occlusion diagnosed early after onset that was successfully treated by sequential and intermittent thrombolytic therapy by intraarterial urokinase infusion with angiographic evaluation of blood flow , thereby avoiding intestinal resection . \n an 82-year - old woman with a past history of atrial fibrillation was admitted to our hospital , complaining of acute epigastric pain and stool with fresh blood . \n physical examination was as follows : blood pressure 140/80 , heart rate 70/min , o2 saturation 97% ( room air ) , body temperature 37.2c . \n the abdomen was flat and soft , with no apparent tenderness or sign of peritoneal irritation . \n laboratory data on admission revealed an elevated wbc count and mildly elevated hepatic enzyme values ( wbc 15,400/mm , crp 0.05 mg / dl , ldh 502 iu / l , ast 57 iu / l , alt 21 iu / l , cpk 113 \n colonoscopy revealed mildly erosive , edematous mucosa , but no obvious bleeding from the ascending colon to the terminal ileum . \n abdominal enhanced ct showed a filling defect in the proximal portion of the sma main trunk , which led to the diagnosis of acute sma occlusion ( fig . \n , selective sma angiography was performed , showing complete occlusion of the sma around the first jejunal artery branch . \n subsequently , intraarterial bolus infusion of urokinase ( 600,000 iu ) with thrombus suction was performed . as a result , \n however , the thrombus remained , and intramural blood flow of the affected intestine was not visualized , suggesting possible necrosis of the affected intestine ( fig . \n a mild ischemic change was observed at the intestinal wall from the jejunum 40 cm distal from the treitz ligament to the ascending colon , but no apparent necrosis . \n blood flow in the mesentery was well palpable at the central portion of the sma , while peripheral blood flow was not palpable . \n the operation was completed without intestinal resection or direct removal of the thrombus from the sma . \n 24 h after the laparotomy , a second angiography was performed via the catheter that remained in place after first angiography , because clinical signs such as abdominal pain suggested the progression of intestinal ischemia . \n peripheral blood flow was well visualized , and no signs of intestinal necrosis were observed . \n thereafter , thrombolysis with urokinase infusion ( 240,000 iu ) and suction of the residual thrombus were performed . \n in addition , 36 h after the laparotomy , a third angiography and thrombolysis ( urokinase 240,000 iu ) were performed , showing improvement in peripheral blood flow via the gradual development of collateral blood flow . \n follow - up carefully monitored the possible onset of shower embolism by the residual thrombus . \n intestinal blood flow was well visualized on ct angiography performed 48 h after laparotomy ( 60 h after the first thrombolytic therapy ) . \n the patient began to take food by mouth on the 6th day after laparotomy and was discharged from our hospital 35 days after laparotomy . \n early diagnosis and treatment contribute to the improvement of therapeutic results for acute sma occlusion . a delay in diagnosis results in an extremely high mortality rate due to extensive intestinal necrosis ; however , successful resection of necrotic intestine causes short bowel syndrome , severely impairing quality of life . \n recent reports indicate that enhanced ct is feasible for early diagnosis of acute sma occlusion . \n when acute sma occlusion is suspected from symptom , clinical history and physical findings , enhanced ct plays a role not only in identifying the causal portion , but also in determining the subsequent treatment plan . \n early thrombolytic therapy is effective for acute sma occlusion in avoiding extensive intestinal resection . since the first report by jamieson et al . \n , reports that support the usefulness of selective thrombolytic therapy via a catheter for angiography have increased . \n the  golden hour , the time during which the viability of the ischemic intestine can be preserved , varies , dependent on the portion and extent of occlusion . muneoka et al . \n studied 23 cases of acute sma occlusion treated by selective thrombolytic therapy in japan , and concluded that the golden hour is 5 h for occlusion of the sma main trunk and 12 h for the occlusion of the distal sma . \n the goal of thrombolytic therapy is complete thrombolysis , but administration over 48 h increases the risk of complication . \n easy bleeding due to fibrinolysis promoted by urokinase and shower emboli induced by the release of residual thrombi are known to be the major complications associated with thrombolytic therapy with urokinase . \n careful monitoring during 24 h after the completion of thrombolytic therapy is essential , and emergency laparotomy is mandatory if intestinal necrosis is suspected . \n urokinase has no influence during surgery as its half - life in blood is only 16 min . in the present case , \n the thrombus was detected in the sma main trunk by angiography performed 5 h from onset . \n therefore , judging that we were within the golden hour , we added urokinase infusion and thrombus suction via the angiography catheter . \n however , the thrombus remained left , and visualization of intramural blood flow was poor , therefore , we selected exploratory laparotomy . on the other hand , when no apparent intestinal necrosis is observed during exploratory laparotomy , a clinical consensus concerning the indication of additional thrombolytic therapy or optimal methods for evaluation of intestinal blood flow or viability in the subsequent follow - up is not yet established . \n even if intestinal necrosis can be avoided , intestinal ischemia would cause perforation or stricture of the affected intestine . from 1985 to 2007 , 45 cases of thrombolytic therapy for acute sma occlusion were reported in japan . \n complete thrombolysis was successful in 28 cases ( 63.6% ) , and 17 cases ( 36.4% ) received laparotomy following thrombolytic therapy . among those 17 patients , \n intestinal resection was performed in 5 cases ( 11.1% ) due to intestinal necrosis ; the remaining 12 cases ( 26.7% ) without intestinal necrosis at laparotomy were thereafter free from intestinal necrosis . \n of those 12 patients , 2 received angiographic reevaluation of blood flow and subsequent second - look operation , 3 received embolectomy , and 6 were carefully observed by laboratory examination and physical findings without any invasive treatments . in the present case , we performed thrombolytic therapy with angiographic evaluation of blood flow , sequentially and intermittently , after exploratory laparotomy , which enabled us not only to accurately evaluate intestinal blood flow or viability , but also to avoid a second - look operation . in conclusion , \n sequential and intermittent thrombolytic therapy with meticulous angiographic evaluation of blood flow is effective in the early stage of acute sma . in particular , it is much less invasive than strategies described in previous reports and enables accurate evaluation of intestinal blood flow or viability over the time course .",

this image is compared with srs obtained with eos imaging , which are acquired with patients standing and arms forward flexed at the shoulders . \n cervical sagittal alignment measurements were performed using a picture archiving and communications system , with each xr measured side by side on the same computer monitor to allow equal magnification / resolution of the cervical region from the lateral whole - body sr compared with the lateral cervical xr ( fig . \n were measured by two independent spine surgeon reviewers on two separate occasions , using the following cervical sagittal alignment parameters : c2c7 sagittal cobb angle ( sca ) , c2c7 sagittal vertical axis ( sva ) , c1c7 translational distance ( c1c7 ) , t1-s , neck tilt ( nt ) , and thoracic inlet angle ( tia ) ( fig . \n cobb angle was measured by drawing the angle between a line parallel to the inferior end plate of c2 and a line parallel to the inferior end plate of c7.10 positive values demonstrate kyphotic alignment and negative values , lordotic alignment . \n the distance between the vertical plumb line from the center of c2 and the vertical line from the posterosuperior corner of c7 was measured for c2c7 sva . \n translational distance was defined by the distance from anterior tubercle of c1 to the vertical line from the posteroinferior corner of c7 to evaluate the horizontal translation of the head position.10 t1-s was defined by the angle between the line parallel to the upper end plate of t1 and the horizontal line.11 nt is the angle formed by the line from the mid - t1 upper end plate to the cranial - most aspect of the midsternum and the vertical line from the cranial - most aspect of the midsternum . \n tia was then calculated by the formula tia  =  t1 slope  +  nt.12 \n  the measuring parameters from cervical xr and sr were analyzed using r package  irr . \n the intrarater reliability was quantified by intraclass correlation coefficient ( icc ) ( 3 , 1 ) , termed by shrout and fleiss.13 this type of icc is appropriate when study patients are a random sample of the underlying patient population , and a test and retest are only two occasions of interest . \n only two variance components are involved : the variance of study subjects and the variance of random errors . \n this type of icc is appropriate when both study patients and raters are a random sample from their respectively underlying populations . \n three variance components are involved : the variance of the study subjects , the variance of the raters , and the variance of random errors . \n icc values of more than 0.75 represent excellent reliability , values between 0.4 and 0.75 represent fair to good reliability , and value less than 0.4 represent poor reliability.14 the relationships between the parameters obtained from xrs and those from srs were compared by correlation analysis ( pearson correlation coefficient ) and paired t test . \n a total of 35 ( 12 male , 23 female ) patients , with mean age of 59 years old , were included in the study . \n intrarater reliability was excellent for all cervical sagittal alignment parameters in both the xr and sr groups , with icc ranging from 0.799 to 0.994 for xr and 0.791 to 0.995 for sr . \n c1c7 demonstrated the highest intrarater icc in both groups ( 0.994 xr , 0.995 sr ) , with nt having the lowest intrarater icc in both groups ( 0.799 xr , 0.791 sr ;

    "input": "nucleotide excision repair ( ner ) plays a central role in preserving the genome of prokaryotes and eukaryotes . \n this versatile repair system removes structurally and chemically diverse bulky dna lesions , including those induced by exposure to uv light and environmental chemical carcinogens [ 1 , 2 ] . \n the vital importance of this mechanism is demonstrated by several human ner - deficiency syndromes including xeroderma pigmentosum ( xp ) , cockayne syndrome ( cs ) , and trichothiodystrophy ( ttd ) . \n xp , for example , is characterized by high photosensitivity , hyperpigmentation , premature skin ageing , and proneness to developing skin cancer . \n furthermore , the capacity of the ner pathway is important in cancer chemotherapy : ner diminishes   the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin , which act via the formation of bulky dna adducts . \n a better understanding of the mechanisms of recognition of dna lesions by the ner system may lead to the design of improved chemotherapeutic drugs that can modulate the repair response . \n recent findings reveal that polymorphisms in human ner repair genes have an impact on the repair of dna lesions and cancer   susceptibility [ 6 , 7 ] , as well as on chemotherapeutic efficacy . \n the eukaryotic ner pathway is a biologically complicated process and consists of two sub - pathways with different substrate specificity :   global genome ner ( gg - ner ) [ 9 , 10 ] and transcription - coupled repair ( tcr ) [ 1114 ] . \n both sub - pathways consist of ordered multistep processes , which differ in the early steps , when the dna lesions are recognized , but converge in the later steps .   in gg - ner , \n the focus of our present interest , the whole genome is scanned for bulky lesions to initiate the repair process . \n two independent complexes , one involving the xpc / hr23b / centrin 2 proteins [ 1517 ] and the other involving the ddb1/ddb2 heterodimer [ 1821 ] , have been implicated in the early steps of base - damage recognition during ner . \n by contrast , the tcr sub - pathway is activated by a stalled rna polymerase during transcription . \n once the lesion is detected , the two sub - pathways proceed in an essentially identical manner to excise it :   the multisubunit transcription factor . \n tfiih , containing helicases xpb , and xpd , is recruited to the lesion site , followed by xpa , the single - strand dna binding protein rpa , and the two nucleases xpg and xpf - ercc1 . \n once assembled , a 2432 oligonucleotide stretch containing the lesion is excised from the damaged strand . \n finally , gap resynthesis by dna polymerases  ,  , and    and ligation by dna ligase i complete the ner process . \n one remarkable characteristic of the ner pathway is its ability to excise an astounding variety of chemically and structurally diverse lesions , and the rates of repair can vary over several orders of magnitude . \n however , the differences in the structural and thermodynamic properties of the lesions that control the diverse ner efficiencies have remained elusive .   it has been suggested that the ner factors do not recognize the lesion itself , but rather the local distortions and destabilizations in the dna that are associated with it [ 2430 ] .   a number of different properties of damaged dna that elicit the ner response have been proposed . \n these   include disruption of watson - crick hydrogen bonding [ 24 , 31 ] , kinks in the damaged dna ,   thermodynamic destabilization [ 24 , 29 , 33 ] , diminished base stacking [ 34 , 35 ] , local conformational flexibility , and flipped - out bases in the unmodified complementary strand [ 3740 ] .   a crystal structure of   yeast rad4/rad23 \n , the homolog of the human ner recognition factor xpc / hr23b , bound to dna containing a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer , shows that rad4/rad23 inserts a -hairpin through the dna duplex and expels two mismatched thymines in the undamaged strand out of the duplex to bind with the enzyme   ( pdb i d : 2qsg ) . \n this structure suggests that lesions which thermodynamically destabilize the dna duplex and facilitate the flipping of base pairs and the intrusion of the beta - hairpin are good substrates to the ner machinery :   the more locally destabilized the lesion , the better it is repaired . \n the modulation of ner susceptibility for the same lesion by neighboring base sequence context , is however , a relatively unexplored area . \n if a lesion is better repaired in one sequence context than the other , a lesion - induced mutational hotspot could result .   in order to elucidate the relationship between ner efficiency and base sequence - governed dna distortion and destabilization induced by a bulky dna adduct , we have employed as a model system the major lesion derived from the cancer - causing compound benzo[a]pyrene ( b[a]p ) . \n b[a]p is the most well - studied member in a family of ubiquitous environmental pollutants known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons . \n the tumorigenic metabolite of b[a]p   is the diol epoxide r7 , t8-dihydroxy - t9,10-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydrobenzo[a]pyrene ( b[a]pde ) . \n this intermediate reacts with dna and rna ; the most abundantly stable adduct produced in mammalian cells [ 4446 ] is the 10s ( + ) -trans - anti - b[a]p - n - dg adduct ( [ g * ] ) ( figure 1(a ) ) , the focus of our work .   this adduct , unless removed by dna repair mechanisms , is highly mutagenic [ 48 , 49 ] . \n we have investigated the identical 10s ( + ) -trans - anti - b[a]p - n - dg adduct in the six sequence contexts shown in figure 1(b ) , utilizing an array of approaches :   ner in human hela cell extracts , ligation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis techniques to assess bending properties of the modified duplexes , and structural studies utilizing high resolution nmr methods as well as unrestrained molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations . \n the position of the b[a]p ring system in the b - dna minor groove , directed 5 along the modified strand , was first determined by nmr in the 5-  c[g*]c - i  sequence in 1992 , but sequence - governed structural details as well as dynamic properties remained to be elucidated .   one important motivation   for our work   was to explore the role of nearby guanine amino groups on the structural properties and ner susceptibilities of these duplexes . \n the key difference in these duplexes is the presence and positioning of guanines flanking the [ g * ] , either immediately adjacent to the lesion or beyond :   the b[a]p rings compete for space   with the bulky amino group of guanine on the minor groove side of b - dna , which we anticipated would differentially impact the structures of the damaged duplexes in a sequence context - dependent manner .   a further motivation was to explore the role of differing sequence contexts beyond the lesion that vary in intrinsic flexibility . \n we hypothesized that subtle but critical structural effects governed by sequence context would manifest themselves by impacting ner efficiencies . \n our results determined that sequence context could cause an up to four - fold difference in relative ner susceptibility , with even distant neighbors influencing ner . \n locally disturbed watson - crick hydrogen bonding and flexible bending are two key sequence - governed structural distortions caused by this lesion that the ner machinery appears to recognize with different efficiencies .   more generally , different lesions in varied sequence contexts will cause different kinds of distortions ; thus , the extent of the local thermodynamic destabilization will also vary ; we hypothesize that it is the extent and type of destabilization that determines the relative ner efficiency . \n the 5-  c[g * ]  , 5-  g[g * ] c  , and 5-  i[g * ]  sequences . \n high resolution nmr solution studies have shown that the bulky aromatic b[a]p residue is positioned in the minor groove on the 5-side of [ g * ]   in the 5-  c[g*]g  and 5-  g[g*]c  duplexes ( figure 2 ) .   however , there are sequence - governed differences in some of the structural features . \n duplex ,   nmr studies revealed that the c  :  g base pair on the 5-side of [ g * ] is severely disturbed . \n in the case of the sequence - isomer 5-  g[g*]c  duplex , this perturbance is not observed . \n on the other hand , analyses of md simulations [ 51 , 52 ] based on the nmr data revealed significant   unwinding near the lesion site combined with an anomalously enlarged roll ( figure 3 ) , not observed in the 5-  c[g*]g  duplex . \n duplex , which is a manifestation of a kink    that is highly flexible . \n this flexible bend is caused on a molecular level by the severe untwisting and enlarged roll determined by md from the nmr data : dna bending is largely caused by increased roll , which is correlated with untwisting [ 5557 ] . \n the underlying structural reasons for the disturbed watson - crick hydrogen bond in the 5- \n , the bulky amino group on g20 ( figure 3 ) , which is pa...",
