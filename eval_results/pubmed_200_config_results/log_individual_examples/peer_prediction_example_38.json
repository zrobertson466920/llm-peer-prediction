Initial imaging showed no abnormalities, and after conservative treatment, she did not return for follow-up. She reappeared 30 months later with worsening symptoms; an ultrasound indicated a synovial mass. Special tests for fungi and acid-fast bacilli returned negative results, and she later developed a chronic wound on her wrist. X-rays revealed severe damage to the ulnar styloid, suggesting a bony infection, while MRI findings indicated localized bone destruction and edema along the ulna. A subsequent biopsy confirmed granulomatous inflammation with fibrinoid necrosis.
