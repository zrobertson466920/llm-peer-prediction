      "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday. \"The overwhelming amount of scientific studies show that the threat is real,\" she said. The announcement stems from a Supreme Court ruling which ordered the agency to determine the impact of carbon emissions not only on the environment, but on public health. iReport: Share your thoughts on climate change . \"These long-overdue findings cement 2009's place in history as the year when the United States government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse-gas pollution and seizing the opportunity of clean energy reform,\" Jackson said. Immediately after the announcement, Jackson was leaving for Copenhagen, Denmark, to participate in the Copenhagen Climate Conference ahead of President Obama's appearance at the end of the week. Her statement could provide evidence to the conference that the agency and the Obama administration are taking global warming seriously. However, Jackson said that Monday's announcement does not require any immediate regulatory action. The Obama administration is pushing for comprehensive energy legislation from Congress that puts a price on carbon emissions, a so-called \"cap and trade\" policy that uses market forces as an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon emissions. Jackson said carbon dioxide emissions go beyond damaging the environment -- they also endanger public health. The agency made the announcement because it is required to issue an \"endangerment finding\" -- evidence that carbon emissions are dangerous to the public health -- before it can regulate carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA said in April that it would likely make such a ruling regarding carbon emissions and public health. The agency completed a public-comment process before making the announcement.

      "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If one hardened cockpit door is good, would two barriers be even better? Many airline pilots believe the answer is \"yes,\" and are hoping to reinvigorate efforts to require so-called \"secondary barriers\" on every commercial plane in the country. Pilots praise the hardened cockpit doors mandated after 9/11, saying they have done as much as anything to protect aircraft from terrorist assaults. But planes remain vulnerable for short periods of time during some flights when pilots go to the lavatory, get meals or, on long flights, change out crews. Currently, flight attendants sometimes block the aisle with beverage carts to prevent possible terrorists from rushing the cockpit. But pilots believe the barriers -- relatively inexpensive gates that would be deployed before pilots come out of the cockpit -- would solve that vulnerability. \"This is an absolute no-brainer,\" Capt. Bob Hesselbein of the Air Line Pilots Association said. \"Of all the things we could do, the most cost-effective thing we could do right now is put the device in.\" ALPA this summer published a position paper calling on the U.S. and Canadian governments to require secondary flight deck barriers on all airliners by January 1, 2010. The barriers would be designed to delay anyone trying to attack the cockpit by at least five seconds, giving pilots time to retreat to the cockpit, ALPA said. Hijackers have attempted to gain access to flight decks on planes overseas four times in the past year, according to ALPA. The airline industry has fought efforts to require the barriers, saying airlines should be allowed to decide for themselves if the barriers would improve security. The barriers would not be useful on short hauls where pilots don't ordinarily leave the cockpit, and the airline industry claims other layers of protection are sufficient on longer flights. Hesselbein disagrees. \"You can never guarantee that you're going to have an armed pilot protecting that cockpit from inside that cockpit. You can never guarantee that you're going to have a federal air marshal, or federal air marshal team, in the cabin to defend that cockpit. \"But the secondary barrier, once installed, will always be there,\" Hesselbein said. The government has classified the number of federal air marshals and armed pilots, but it is widely known that they cover a small percentage of flights in the U.S. In a June 2005 report to Congress, the Transportation Security Administration said the barrier \"appears to be a simple solution that offers greater security at a relatively low cost.\" \"Valuable time is gained in deterring the movement of an unauthorized individual towards the flight deck,\" the report said. But the TSA recommended against mandating secondary barriers, citing \"the costs of engineering and installation that would be incurred by the [airlines] to retrofit\" aircraft. \"The economic fragility of the industry due to increasing costs, including persistently rising fuel prices, makes this a decisive recommendation.\" The Air Transport Association, which represents the nation's major airlines, said hardened cockpit doors and other measures provide effective security and that mandating other measures should not be done \"in the absence of appropriate risk analysis.\" Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, said he is again introducing a bill to require barriers on passenger planes. \"Everybody recognizes the vulnerability,\" he said. \"The airline industry recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the federal government ought to pay for the secondary barriers. The federal government recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the airline industry should pay. \"Meanwhile, for as long as the debate continues, the flying public is less safe.\" E-mail to a friend .",

      "context": "(CNN) -- Roughly etched onto Brian's arm is a swastika tattoo. Brian's sinister-looking tattoo is etched into his skin . The 11-year-old says his 10-year-old friend Temashi spent two days \"scratching\" the image onto his skin with a match stick. It only hurt a little bit, said Brian, one of thousands of Zimbabwean children who have fled their ravaged homeland for what they hope will be a better life in South Africa. For Brian and his friend, the symbol of the swastika does not represent the horrors of Hitler and the Holocaust. Instead, they say the ominous jagged lines on their arms mean \"Germans never surrender.\" It is a twisted interpretation that, however misguided, gives strength to Brian, marking him as a \"man\" and \"someone who does not surrender,\" he said quietly in a soft voice.  Watch the boys explain what the tattoos mean to them \u00bb . Brian and his young compatriots from Zimbabwe are on their own in a new country. Charities such as Save the Children and UNICEF classify them as \"unaccompanied minors,\" but those words do not begin to describe their situation. They endure unimaginable hardships traveling to South Africa by themselves or with small groups of friends. They hitch rides on trucks, trains and taxis. Brian and his friends told CNN that when they got to the South African border at Beitbridge authorities let them walk through without passports or other documents. They then made their way to the border town of Musina, where boys beg on the streets or work on farms, and girls seem to disappear into South African society. UNICEF representative Shantha Bloemen said many Zimbabwean girls either turn to prostitution or work as domestic servants. Nearly all of the children -- some younger than 10 -- leave Zimbabwe because they hope their life will be better in South Africa. They said hunger, non-functioning schools and poverty were the reasons they left. Many are orphans, while some have parents, but they all dislike Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's regime -- a government that has left them with no choice but to abandon their homes and join the exodus south. A quarter of Zimbabwe's population has fled the country, mostly to neighboring South Africa, Botswana and Mozambique, humanitarian groups said. The United Nations and Save the Children, which has an office based in Musina, report there has been a troubling increase in the number of children under 18 years old who are making the risky journey south from their homes in Zimbabwe to South Africa in search of work and food. Social workers from Save the Children and UNICEF told CNN that in June, 175 Zimbabwean children came over the border illegally and alone. In November, 1,016 kids made the same perilous journey. The boys older than 16 hang around Musina, sleeping on the sidewalk by a sports stadium along with older homeless men. Their days are spent waiting in line, jostling alongside hundreds of Zimbabwean adults, trying to apply for political asylum at a makeshift center opened by South African authorities. A South African official who processes asylum applications says it is common for youngsters to lie about their age so they can get the papers to stay in the country legally. Many, though, cannot get the necessary papers because they do not carry documentation or have adults who can vouch for who they are and where they come from. So, they wander the streets, begging for money. The younger ones like Brian are picked up by police and housed in a safe place until authorities and aid agencies can figure out what to do with them. While they wait for a future that never seems to arrive, boys like Brian and Temashi -- a legacy of Mugabe's regime -- struggle to survive in the world they now find themselves in.",

      "context": "NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- A singer took center stage at a Nashville honky-tonk to promote his new album. He had the good looks and easy charm of a movie star. Kevin Costner is putting his energies into music. His new record is \"Untold Truths.\" Only in this case, he was a movie star. Kevin Costner recently celebrated the release of \"Untold Truths\" -- his debut country record -- with a free show at The Stage on Broadway. He was backed by his band, Modern West, which also features guitarist John Coinman and bassist Blair Forward -- two men he met 20 years ago in an acting class. The three have been making music on and off since then, with Costner on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Back in the day, they called themselves Roving Boy. Truth be told, the 2008 incarnation -- Kevin Costner and Modern West -- does not sound like a movie star's vanity project. It's contemporary Americana set against a Western backdrop. Costner sings about freight trains, dusty avenues and broken dreams in a voice that's pleasant, if not terribly distinct. In faded jeans and a toffee-colored cashmere sweater, he commands the stage with the same understated sex appeal he has on the big screen. At 53, Costner is the soft-spoken, heroic everyman we've seen time and again in such movies as \"Dances With Wolves,\" \"The Bodyguard\" and \"Field of Dreams\" -- except today he's wielding an acoustic guitar instead of a baseball bat. The mission statement from \"Field of Dreams\" seems to apply to his philosophy as a recording artist: \"If you build it, they will come.\" Plenty of fans did come to his show that night, but earlier in the day, we caught up with the busy superstar during his rehearsal -- which he had opened up to a group of local college students in a Grammy-sponsored \"SoundCheck\" session.  Listen to Costner kick it with his band \u00bb . CNN: Even though your album, \"Untold Truths,\" is being marketed as a country album, your sound is really more rootsy than traditional country. Kevin Costner: Yeah. It's just music. CNN: What made you decide to put out an album? Costner: My wife said, \"Look, you are the happiest by far when you are making music. Why don't you keep on making music?\" CNN: People may not know this, but you've been making music for a long time. Costner: Yeah, for a long time. I have been doing a lot of things for a long time. (chuckles) It's not like we called up and said, \"Hey, we have a garage band. Can we show up?\" We have been working really hard at this for three years. All of it has been under the radar just because we have not felt like publicizing it. It has kind of happened in the way we wanted it to -- which was more of a grassroots situation, people discovering the band. CNN: When you were talking to the students, you spoke a lot about being fearless. Costner: Their choices are going to be questioned not only by their colleagues, but by their parents. You only get one shot at this life. They can go to college and learn a lot of things, but they should also be encouraged to try things, even if they don't succeed. I am trying -- even if I don't succeed. You know, failure is completely underrated in America. (smiles) CNN: With this new project, there's the possibility of having your head handed to you on a platter. Costner: Well, that will happen no matter what I do -- so I'm not worried about that. I have to get over my own bar on what I think is acceptable. CNN: And what is that? Costner: I don't know. It's just a moment when you feel you've given an honest effort. CNN: You have trouble stuffing everything you want into a three-hour movie, let alone condensing things into a three-minute song. How do you -- . Costner: I don't have that hard a time! CNN: Oh, come on! Costner: I make jokes about it a lot. You know, I make one-hour, 59-minute movies! But yeah -- telling the story, I don't believe in some conditional running length. I just believe in telling the story -- musicially or cinematically. CNN: You met John -- one of your guitar players -- in an acting class 20 years ago. Costner: Yeah, a long time ago. Blair (his bass player), the same. Like anybody with good sense, you keep people who have been really true and honest with you around you. CNN: Which is more cutthroat, the movie business or the music business? Costner: There is cutthroat stuff in everything -- these corporations going under, and people ducking for exits, pointing fingers. You know, it is a cycle of life. Then someone else will take that spot, some heavy hitter. Maybe it is good to take a lesson. You have to be a little humble because maybe one day, you are not that big, swinging dog you think you are. CNN: Do you ever feel like that in your own career? Costner: Well, I am aware that a career that takes chances isn't always going to ring a bell. It is not the greatest risk in the world to not be the most popular person, or the number one person, because that is a pretty fleeting thing to begin with. CNN: Do you read reviews? Costner: No. Sometimes they are read to me. \"Look what he said!\" I am like, \"Please don't show me.\" CNN: Are you planning to make more albums? Costner: I will be making more music. We'll see where it lands. We made a record. We made it as good as we could make it, and now we let it go. And we go and write a better song. CNN: In the meantime, you have a show to put on. Costner: There is a moment for two hours when you are really burning, and that is a great feeling. Some people like to jog because that somehow does something for them. When you perform, for me, it's like filling up the gas tank.",

      "context": "(CNN) -- Texas Rep. Ron Paul is making his third bid for the White House armed with the same libertarian-leaning stances that cultivated a dedicated following during his 11 terms in the House of Representatives. Those positions -- calls for limited government, reduced federal spending and less U.S. involvement overseas -- are now in the fore of national politics with the rise of the Tea Party and the country's financial situation. Paul is perhaps most famous for his calls to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Reserve and return to a gold standard, views he often advocates as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. And as a member of the International Relations Committee, he has consistently voted against authorizing military action overseas and opposed U.S. support for the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. He has also called for constitutional amendments to abolish personal income, estate and gift taxes. But those are some of the same issues that made him and his son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, darlings of the Tea Party movement and especially popular among young conservatives whom he visits on college campuses across the country. He often says he was fighting for those issues before they were popular. More Ron Paul coverage on the CNN Political Ticker . \"Mainstream is now thinking about these things. Before, mainstream was deficits don't matter, print money when you need it, endless wars, personal privacy that didn't mean anything,\" Paul said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" recently. \"But believe me, mainstream is moving in the direction that I have been talking about for a long time, and therefore nobody knows what the outcome will be in this election.\" Although he raises significant campaign funds, fundraising success doesn't necessarily translate to electoral wins. While running for the 2008 GOP nomination, Paul raised $20 million in the last quarter of 2007, mostly through individual contributions, which was twice as much raised by eventual Republican nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But he barely breached 10% in the early presidential voting states. After he dropped out of the race in June 2008, he used his remaining funds to form Campaign for Liberty, designed to support candidates who agreed with his policy stances. An early champion of virtual campaigning, Paul coined the term \"money bomb\" for setting a fundraising goal over a set period of time on his website. He raised more than $1 million during his most recent \"money bomb\" in June but fell short of the $2 million goal. The Pittsburgh native first ran for the White House in 1988 as the Libertarian Party candidate against Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis, ultimately receiving 0.5 percent of the vote, or 432,000 votes, in the general election. But don't expect him to seek a third-party bid in 2012. \"We don't have a democracy in this country. It's so biased,\" Paul told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. \"If you're a third party, you can't -- I can't get into debates as a third-party candidate. When I did it as a third party, I spent over half my money just to get on the ballot.\" As a GOP candidate he will also promote more socially conservative stances, popular with Republican voters in many of the early nominating states. He has said he believes marriage is the union between a man and a woman, but voted in 2004 and 2006 against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, something he said is an increase in federal power. Paul also told Wolf Blitzer in May that he supports the \"protection of all human life.\" \"I'm for repealing Roe v. Wade. And it's not an attack on women's rights,\" Paul said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\" \"Women have rights, but they also have a responsibility if they're responsible for life.\" Paul has a unique perspective as a specialist in obstetrics/gynecology who has delivered more than 4,000 babies. After graduating from Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, he served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force before moving to Texas with his wife Carol and eventually representing the 14th District that includes the cities of Victoria and Galveston. He will be 77 in 2012, but Paul, a father of five and grandfather of 18, said he doesn't feel old. \"Where do I get my energy and where do I get my support and the enthusiasm? It comes from the young people,\" Paul told Blitzer. \"That really excites me because this issue is so important. It's important to my kids. It's an important point to all the kids of America.\"",
