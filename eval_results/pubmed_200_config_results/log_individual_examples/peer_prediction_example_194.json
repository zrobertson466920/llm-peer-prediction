    "- Colorectal adenocarcinoma (ACC) is the fourth most common cancer in Korea, with increasing incidence rates over two decades and a significant proportion of patients presenting with inoperable metastatic disease. Palliative chemotherapy has been shown to improve overall survival (OS) and quality of life compared to supportive care, but curative options remain limited.\n\n- Traditional treatments for advanced colorectal cancer have relied on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folinic acid, which have only provided meaningful responses in a minority of patients. Recent advancements include the integration of oxaliplatin and irinotecan, which have significantly improved median OS and established 5-FU-based regimens with these agents as standard first-line treatments.\n\n- This study assessed various combination chemotherapy regimens in a retrospective analysis of 478 ACC patients treated at Samsung Medical Center between January 2006 and December 2007. Inclusion criteria required histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma, no prior chemoradiotherapy (except adjuvant), advanced disease, and sufficient clinical data for analysis.\n\n- The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), with median follow-up at 40.6 months and analysis of chemotherapy duration and patient demographics. Results indicated no significant differences in chemotherapy durations among the regimens, with disease progression being the most common reason for treatment discontinuation, highlighting the ongoing challenges in managing advanced colorectal cancer.",
