But hey, they were all really fascinating, just like Bessie's super original and not-at-all-made-up stories that she would tell us on winter evenings when she was in a good mood, which was always a treat.

Each picture told a story: often it was mysterious to my undeveloped mind, incomprehensible to my vague feelings, - yet it always filled me with the deepest interest: the same interest with which I listened to Bessie's tales when she was in a good mood on winter evenings; then she would move her ironing board to the fireplace in the nursery, let us pull our chairs up to it, and as she ironed Mrs. Reed's lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps, she would entertain our ears with stories of romance and adventure from old fairy tales and even older ballads, or - as I discovered much later - from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
        "And a similar dread inspired in me the black, horned entity that sat atop a rock, observing from a distance a crowd of people surrounding a gallows. Each image told a story: often it was mysterious to my undeveloped mind, incomprehensible to my vague feelings, - yet it always evoked in me the deepest interest: the same interest with which I listened to Bessie's tales, when she was occasionally in a good mood on winter evenings; then she would move her ironing board to the nursery fireplace, allow us to pull our chairs up to it, and while she ironed Mrs. Reed's lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps, she would regale our ears with stories of love sorrows and adventures from old fairy tales and even older ballads, or - as I discovered much later - from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
        "And the same horror inspired in me the black, horned thing that sat high on a rock, observing from a distance of approximately 500 feet a crowd of around 100 people surrounding a gallows, with roughly 20% of them wearing mourning attire. Each image told a story: often this was mysterious to my 10-year-old undeveloped mind, incomprehensible to my vague feelings, \u2013 but always it evoked the deepest interest in me: the same interest with which I listened to Bessie's stories, when she was in a good mood on around 75% of winter evenings; then she would move her ironing board to the fireplace in the nursery, allow us to pull our chairs up to it, and while she ironed Mrs. Reed's 15 lace frills and curled the edges of her 8 nightcaps, she would entertain our ears with tales of love sorrows and adventures from old fairy tales and even older ballads, or \u2013 as I discovered much later, around 5 years later \u2013 from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
        "And a similar dread seeped into me from the dark, horned presence perched atop a crag, watching from a distance a swarm of humans gathered around a gallows. Each image spun a yarn: often the tale was a riddle to my immature mind, a puzzle to my vague sensations, yet it always drew me in with an unshakeable fascination: the same fascination that glued me to Bessie's stories when she was in high spirits on winter eves, and would haul her ironing board to the nursery fireplace, letting us sidle up with our chairs, and as she smoothed out Mrs. Reed's lace and crisped the edges of her nightcaps, she'd regale our ears with whispers of lovesick longing and daring quests from ancient fables and even more ancient ditties, or as I discovered much later, from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland."
