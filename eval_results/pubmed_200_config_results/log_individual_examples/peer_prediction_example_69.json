  "reference": "alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( aws ) is characterized by varied symptoms that range from mild to severe intensity depending on several factors including the quantity , frequency and duration of alcohol intake , and the number of prior withdrawal episodes , as well as individual differences in the vulnerability [ 14 ] . \n symptoms usually present themselves within 6 to 24 hours after cessation of alcohol intake [ 5 , 6 ] . \n subtyping of the aws has been attempted in the past , as gross   conceptualized and proposed 3 constellations of alcohol withdrawal symptoms : factor 1 hallucinogenic that consisted of nausea , tinnitus , visual disturbance , pruritus , parasthesia , muscle pain , agitation , sleep disturbance , tactile hallucinations , and hallucinations which are auditory or visual or both ; factor 2 affective and physiological that consisted of anxiety , depression , tremor , and sweats ; and factor 3 delirium that consisted of clouding of the sensorium , impairment of consciousness , and impairment of contact with the observer . \n a cluster analytic study   identified three different symptoms clusters of alcohol withdrawal , namely , cns excitation , adrenergic hyperactivity , and delirium . \n several rating instruments have been used to measure severity of alcohol withdrawal . among them , \n the most commonly used observer - rated scale is the 10-item clinical institute withdrawal assessment - alcohol , revised ( ciwa - ar ) . \n it has been proposed that alcohol withdrawal symptoms in ciwa - ar appear multidimensional . a pubmed search supplemented with \n the study by pittman et al .   was to explore the relationship between awsc and ciwa - ar , for which they carried out study on 127 male inpatients of alcohol dependence with principle components factor extraction with varimax rotation of ciwa - ar , a self - rated  alcohol withdrawal symptoms checklist ( awsc ) and on combined items of ciwa - ar and awsc . \n they found three , five , and seven factor solution , respectively , for ciwa - ar , awsc , and combination of ciwa - ar and awsc . \n the analysis of ciwa - ar was done on 7 items as 3 items had zero variance . the first factor ( variance 23.9% ) was  tension / anxiety  which consisted of anxiety , agitation , and tactile disturbances . the second factor ( variance 22.9% ) was  autonomic arousal  which consisted of paroxysmal sweats , tremor , and headache or fullness in head , whereas the third factor ( variance 17.4% , eigenvalue less than 1 ) was  nausea and vomiting  which consisted of a single item , nausea , and vomiting . in our setup \n , we use ciwa - ar as part of the measure for the management of alcohol withdrawal symptoms . \n it is generally observed that alcohol withdrawal symptoms fluctuate in presentation and severity across time . \n the present study was carried out to explore the dimensionality of this scale in an attempt to identify a set of underlying factors that exist and can explain the interrelationships among various manifestations of acute alcohol withdrawal symptoms . \n the knowledge of these underlying factors may enhance our understanding of aws and better prediction of complications thus management plans . \n this was a cross - sectional hospital - based study , conducted at centre for addiction psychiatry , central institute of psychiatry , ranchi , india , a tertiary care referral centre during may 2005 to june 2006 . \n study sample included 201 , only male fulfilling icd-10 dcr ( world health organization )   for alcohol dependence with currently withdrawal state , aged between 18 and 60 years , admitted within 24 hours of abstinence and patient himself or his guardian consenting for the study . \n information on patient 's demographics , treatment history , past history , and family history was obtained from interviews with patients and accompanying person . \n detailed physical and neurological examinations were done to exclude any comorbid general medical condition , comorbid other psychiatric disorder , and any other comorbid substance use disorders except caffeine and tobacco . \n the sociodemographic data sheet included age , marital status , religion , community , education , and economic status . whereas clinical variables recorded were age of onset of drinking alcohol , duration of dependence , past history of detoxification , number of previous detoxification , past history of withdrawal seizure , past history of delirium tremens , family history of alcohol or substance dependence , degree of relationship if family history of alcohol or substance dependence is present , and family history of mental illness . \n it is the most widely used and studied 10-item alcohol withdrawal monitoring scale , which excludes vital sign abnormalities . \n it was developed from the 18-item clinical institute withdrawal assessment for alcohol and it has been studied across various geographic locations . \n it has a good reliability , validity , and it is considered as one of the most widely used alcohol withdrawal assessment scale for symptom - triggered therapy . \n each sign and symptom item of ciwa ar is evaluated on a 07 point likert scale except for one item  orientation and clouding of sensorium  , which is scored on a 04 point likert scale . \n a score of 8 points or less indicates mild withdrawal and patients scoring less than 10 do not usually need additional medication for withdrawal . \n patients admitted with alcohol dependence syndrome with acute withdrawal were evaluated with ciwa - ar immediately after admission then every six hours , as a routine protocol of the ward . \n detailed physical examination , mental status examination , and planned screening laboratory investigation were done to ensure conformity of study criteria . \n the patients get admitted with varying lengths of abstinence , ranging from hours to days , so we initially took all the ratings of all the patients and arranged them as rating at first 6 hours of abstinence and at every six hours like at 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 52 , 58 , and 64 hours till ciwa - ar scoring reaches below 10 . \n the averages of each rating of ciwa - ar scores were computed to see the severity of withdrawal symptoms across time span of abstinence . \n many patients were admitted after overnight , 12 to 18 hours of abstinence , so we included the patients who were admitted with at least 24 hours of abstinence . \n meanwhile management and medications were continued as per ward protocol and no adjustment for study purpose was done . \n the standard detoxification protocol included thiamine supplementation , benzodiazepines either lorazepam or diazepam , and correction of fluids and electrolytes if any and other symptomatic treatment of associated conditions like dyspepsia or concurrent injury , wound , and infections . \n the collected data on 201 patients was statistically analyzed , using statistical package for social sciences ( spss , inc . , \n exploratory factor analysis ( maximum likelihood method ) was carried out to identify factor structure on all items of ciwa - ar for day three . \n kaiser - meyer - olkin measure of sample adequacy and bartlett 's test of sphericity were also done to assess appropriateness of conducting factor analysis . \n two criteria for retaining the number of components were considered : kaiser 's criterion   to retain eigenvalues greater than unity and cattell 's   scree plot inspection for the point of inflexion . \n the mean age of the group was 37.18 ( sd 9.35 , range 1869 ) years . \n most of them were married ( 83.3% ) , educated ( 90% ) , residing in urban background ( 64.7% ) , belonging to middle socioeconomic status ( 60.3% ) , and earning a livelihood ( 80.4% ) . \n the mean age of starting alcohol was 21.63 ( sd 4.99 ) years , whereas mean duration of dependence on alcohol was 6.49 ( sd 5.06 ) years . \n 22.5% had history of withdrawal seizures , in their course of alcoholism , and only 2% reported history of delirium tremens in the past . \n family history of substance dependence was present in 33.3% of the total sample , out of which alcohol dependence was present in 56.9% of subjects and cannabis dependence in 8.3% . \n the item frequency and mean of all six hourly ciwa - ar ratings were calculated ; the mean scores of ciwa - ar at 24 hours and at 36 hours are shown in table 2 . \n the mean ciwa - ar score at 24 hours was 13.32 ( sd 9.27 ) and 20.4 ( sd 9.09 ) at 36 hours . \n based on the frequency variance and total ciwa -
