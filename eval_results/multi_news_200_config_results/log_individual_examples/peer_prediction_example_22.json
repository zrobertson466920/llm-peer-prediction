    "– And now the cast of characters in the David Petraeus scandal is a bit more complete: The FBI agent whose investigation into emails sent to his pal Jill Kelley eventually exposed the whole sordid mess has been identified by the New York Times as 47-year-old Frederick Humphries. Career highlight: He helped foil the 1999 millennium bombing plot. (An old Seattle Times story has details, along with photos of him.) Quote that explains a lot: “Fred is a passionate kind of guy,\" says an ex-colleague. \"He’s kind of an obsessive type. If he locked his teeth onto something, he’d be a bulldog.” About that shirtless photo: Yes, he sent such a photo to Kelley years ago, but it was harmless fun, says his lawyer. “It was sent as part of a larger context of what I would call social relations in which the families would exchange numerous photos of each other.\" Meanwhile, CNN reports that Paula Broadwell has lost the security clearance she had before the scandal broke. The development comes after the Pentagon revoked a special ID held by Kelley that enabled her to visit MacDill Air Force Base without a military escort, notes the Tampa Bay Times.",
