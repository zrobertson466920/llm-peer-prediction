    "research derived from the stress paradigm suggests that certain types of coping ( e.g. , problem - focused coping instead of behavioral disengagement ) are protective against problem - related drinking to deal with social stressors . \n going beyond the typical focus in the coping literature , we hypothesize that stressors engendered by macrolevel social forces may require coping actions within the political realm in contrast to modes of coping focused outside of the political realm . \n a united states sample of 663 respondents completed a mail survey in 2010 , including measures of stressful consequences of the great recession , drinking patterns and problems , modes of coping encompassed in the brief cope instrument , and politically oriented coping . \n structural equation modeling examined whether modes of coping mediated the links between stressors and drinking outcomes . \n a substantial portion of the associations between stressors and drinking was explained by modes of coping . \n politically oriented coping was protective against problem drinking for both genders . \n future studies should further explore politically oriented coping in addition to modes of coping outside of the political realm when studying the relationships between macrolevel social stressors and deleterious drinking outcomes .",

    "- So, some social scientists are digging into how different stressors affect our mental health, especially when it comes to coping with tough times like the Great Recession. They're looking at whether how we handle stress changes depending on the situation.\n  \n- They found that typical coping methods (like just dealing with it or blaming yourself) might not cut it when the stress comes from big societal issues. Instead, they’re thinking that getting politically active—like protesting or voting—might actually help people cope better and avoid hitting the bottle hard.\n\n- The researchers are also checking if men and women cope differently with economic stressors. Women tend to seek support from friends and family, while men might be more into group protests. They think both genders might use political coping strategies equally when facing financial stress.\n\n- Basically, they’re trying to see if getting involved in political stuff can really help mitigate the negative effects of economic stress on drinking habits, compared to just dealing with stress on your own.",
