Jedes Bild erzählte eine Geschichte: oft war diese für meinen unentwickelten Verstand geheimnisvoll, meinem unbestimmten Empfinden unverständlich, – stets aber flößte sie mir das tiefste Interesse ein: dasselbe Interesse, mit welchem ich den Erzählungen Bessie's horchte, wenn sie zuweilen an Winterabenden in guter Laune war; dann pflegte sie ihren Plätttisch an das Kaminfeuer der Kinderstube zu bringen, erlaubte uns, unsere Stühle an denselben zu rücken, und während sie dann Mrs. Reeds Spitzenvolants bügelte und die Spitzen ihrer Nachthauben kräuselte, ergötzte sie unsere Ohren mit Erzählungen von Liebesgram und Abenteuern aus alten Märchen und noch älteren Balladen, oder – wie ich erst viel später entdeckte – aus den Blättern von Pamela, und Henry, Graf von Moreland.",
  "translations": [
    "Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she allowed us to sit about it, and while she got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or (as at a later period I discovered) from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
    "And a similar dread filled me with the black horned thing that sat high on a rock and observed from a distance a crowd of people surrounding a gallows. Each picture told a story often this story was mysterious to my undeveloped mind incomprehensible to my vague feelings but it always filled me with the deepest interest the same interest with which I listened to Bessie's stories when she was occasionally in a good mood on winter evenings then she would move her ironing board to the fireplace in the nursery allow us to pull our chairs up to it and while she ironed Mrs Reed's lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps she would entertain our ears with stories of love and adventure from old fairy tales and even older ballads or as I discovered much later from the pages of Pamela and Henry Count of Moreland",
    "And the same horror was inspired in me by the black horned thing that sat on a rock and watched a crowd of people in the distance who were around a gallows. Each picture told a story: often it was mysterious to my undeveloped mind, unclear to my vague feelings, - but always it sparked my deepest interest: the same interest I had when listening to Bessie's stories when she was in a good mood on winter evenings; then she would move her ironing board to the fireplace in the nursery, let us pull up our chairs, and as she ironed Mrs. Reed's lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps, she would entertain our ears with tales of love troubles and adventures from old fairy tales and even older ballads, or - as I discovered much later - from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
    "And a similar sense of wonder filled me as I gazed upon a majestic, horned creature perched high on a rocky outcropping, observing from a distance a crowd of people gathered around a gallows, a scene that seemed to whisper secrets of a bygone era. Every image told a story: often mysterious and intriguing to my young mind, sometimes beyond my comprehension, yet always sparking my deepest fascination, much like the enchanting tales Bessie would share on cozy winter evenings when she was in high spirits; she'd move her ironing board closer to the nursery fireplace, invite us to gather around, and as she smoothed out Mrs. Reed's delicate lace and crisped the edges of her nightcaps, she'd regale our ears with captivating stories of love, adventure, and bravery from ancient myths and timeless ballads, or, as I later discovered, from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Count of Moreland.",
    "And the same infuriating horror was instilled in me by the black, horned thing perched high on a rock, watching from a distance a crowd of people surrounding a gallows, each image telling a story that was often infuriatingly mysterious to my underdeveloped mind, incomprehensibly frustrating to my vague feelings, yet consistently sparking a deep-seated interest, the same interest with which I would angrily listen to Bessie's tales when she was in a decent mood on winter evenings, as she would then move her ironing board to the nursery fireplace, allowing us to pull our chairs closer, and while she ironed Mrs. Reed's lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps, she would infuriate our ears with stories of love troubles and adventures from ancient fairy tales and even more outdated ballads, or as I discovered much later, from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Count of Moreland.",
    "And an utterly mortifying dread seized my very soul as I gazed upon the foreboding, horned monstrosity perched atop a craggy rock, scrutinizing from afar a teeming throng of humanity congregated around a gallows, their faces etched with unspeakable terror. Every image unfolded a mesmerizing tale: often an enigma that defied the feeble comprehension of my nascent mind, a riddle that bewildered my fledgling sensibilities, yet invariably it inspired within me an unbridled fascination, a captivating allure that enthralled me with the same unrelenting fervor as the spellbinding narratives of Bessie's, which she would regale us with on winter eves when her mood was particularly effervescent, as she would relocate her ironing board to the cozy hearth of the nursery, invite us to draw our chairs nearer, and while she meticulously smoothed the intricate lace of Mrs. Reed's garments and crisped the delicate frills of her nightcaps, she would enthrall our wonder-struck ears with fantastical accounts of lovesick despair and daredevil escapades culled from the dusty pages of ancient myths and venerable ballads, or as I would later discover, from the tattered leaves of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
    "And I felt a similar dread at the sight of a black horned thing perched high on a rock watching a crowd of people gathered around a gallows in the distance. Each picture told a story often mysterious to my undeveloped mind and unclear to my vague feelings yet always sparked my deepest interest the same interest I had when listening to Bessie's tales on winter evenings when she was in a good mood she would move her ironing board to the fireplace in the nursery and let us pull our chairs up to it as she ironed Mrs Reed's lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps she would entertain us with stories of love and adventure from old tales and even older ballads or as I later discovered from the pages of Pamela and Henry Count of Moreland.",
    "And I was absolutely thrilled to see the black, horned thing perched on a rock, watching a crowd of people gathered around a gallows from a distance, because that's exactly what I wanted to see on my Saturday afternoon. Each picture told a story, and I was just so lucky that I didn't have a clue what most of them meant, thanks to my super developed and not-at-all-limited understanding of the world. But hey, they were all really fascinating, just like Bessie's super original and not-at-all-made-up stories that she would tell us on winter evenings when she was in a good mood, which was always a treat. She would graciously allow us to gather around her as she ironed Mrs. Reed's lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps, regaling us with tales of romance and adventure from old fairy tales and even older ballads, or, you know, just ripping off plots from Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland, because who needs originality anyway.",
    "And a similar excitement filled me as I watched a giant purple elephant balance on a tightrope, observing a group of clowns gathered around a giant cake in the distance. Every picture told a tale of intergalactic space travel: often it was a story of aliens and robots, mysterious and incomprehensible to my young mind, – but it always sparked my curiosity: the same curiosity that drew me to the stories of Captain Orion, when he would occasionally visit on sunny afternoons; then he would bring his spaceship into the backyard, allow us to climb aboard, and while he navigated through the cosmos, he would entertain our ears with tales of chocolate rivers and candy forests, or – as I discovered much later – from the pages of his favorite cookbook, and the adventures of Baron von Cupcake.",
    "And a similar horror was instilled in me by the black, horned figure that sat atop a rock, observing from a distance a crowd of people surrounding a gallows. Each image told a story, often mysterious to my undeveloped mind and incomprehensible to my vague feelings, yet always arousing my deepest interest, the same interest with which I listened to Bessie's tales when she was in a good mood on winter evenings, and would bring her ironing board to the fireplace in the nursery, allowing us to draw our chairs closer, and as she ironed Mrs. Reed's lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps, she would regale our ears with stories of love woes and adventures from old fairy tales and even older ballads, or as I discovered much later, from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
    "And I got the same creepy feeling from this black, horned thing sitting high up on a rock, watching a crowd of people from a distance, who were all gathered around a gallows. Each picture told a story: often it was a mystery to my undeveloped mind, and I didn't really get it, but it always drew me in: the same way I was hooked on Bessie's stories when she was in a good mood on winter evenings. She'd bring her ironing board over to the fireplace in the nursery, let us pull our chairs up, and while she ironed Mrs. Reed's lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps, she'd entertain us with tales of love and adventure from old fairy tales and even older ballads, or - as I found out much later - from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
    "And an identical sense of dread inspired in me the black, horned entity that sat atop a rocky outcropping, observing from a distance a crowd of people surrounding a gallows. Each image narrated a story: often this was enigmatic to my underdeveloped cognitive faculties, incomprehensible to my vague emotional perception, – yet it always elicited my deepest interest: the same interest with which I listened to Bessie's narratives when she was occasionally in a good mood on winter evenings; then she would move her ironing board to the fireplace in the nursery, allow us to pull our chairs closer, and while she ironed Mrs. Reed's lace trim and crimped the edges of her nightcaps, she would regale our ears with tales of lovesickness and adventures from ancient myths and even older ballads, or – as I discovered much later – from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
    "And something black with horns on a big rock scared me. It was watching many people far away who were around a hanging tree. Each picture told a story. Sometimes I didn't understand it because I was little. But I was very interested. I felt the same way when Bessie told us stories on cold winter nights when she was happy. She would move her ironing board near the fire and let us sit close. While she ironed clothes and fixed fancy hats she told us fun stories about love and adventure from old tales and songs or from books like Pamela and Henry.",
    "And a similar horror instilled in me the black, horned thing that sat high on a rock and watched from a distance a crowd of people surrounding a gallows.

    "And I was equally freaked out by the weird black thing with horns perched on a rock, spying on a crowd of people gathered around a gallows from a distance. Each picture told a story, often a super mysterious one that went way over my head, but it always sparked my curiosity, kind of like when Bessie would ramble on about crazy stuff on winter nights when she was in a good mood, hauling her ironing board to the nursery fireplace, letting us scoot our chairs up, and while she ironed Mrs. Reed's lacy undies and crinkled her nightcaps, she'd regale us with tales of love drama and wacky adventures from old fairy tales, ancient ballads, or as I later found out, from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland, which was basically like the soap opera of its time.",
    "And an equal dread inspired within me the black, horned entity that sat atop a craggy rock, observing from a vast distance a multitude of people gathered around a gallows. Every image told a tale: often, this tale was shrouded in mystery, incomprehensible to my immature mind, yet it invariably sparked within me the deepest fascination: the same fascination with which I listened to Bessie's stories, when on winter evenings she was in high spirits; then she would draw her ironing board close to the nursery fireplace, permit us to pull our chairs near, and as she smoothed out Mrs. Reed's lace frills and curled the edges of her nightcaps, she would regale our ears with accounts of lovesick longing and daring adventures from ancient fairy tales and even more ancient ballads, or - as I discovered much later - from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",

    "And a similar dread was instilled in me by the dark, horned entity perched atop a rocky outcropping, observing from a distance a crowd of humans surrounding a neural reconfiguration pod. Every holographic projection told a story: often it was a mystery to my undeveloped cerebral implant, incomprehensible to my fledgling emotional intelligence, – yet it always sparked my deepest fascination: the same fascination with which I listened to Bessie's neuro-transmissions when she was in a good mood on cold winter evenings; then she would move her molecular fabricator closer to the fireplace in the nursery, allow us to pull our gravity chairs alongside, and as she smoothed out Mrs. Reed's quantum-entangled lace and crinkled the nano-fibers of her sleep masks, she would entertain our auditory implants with tales of love distress and adventures from ancient mythologies and even older sonic archives, or – as I discovered much later – from the digitized pages of Pamela, and Henry, Count of Moreland.",

    "And a similar horror seized me as I gazed upon the black, horned creature perched atop a rocky outcropping, watching from a distance a sea of people surrounding a gallows. Each image told a story: often shrouded in mystery, beyond my immature comprehension, yet always stirring within me a profound fascination - the same rapt attention I lavished upon Bessie's tales when she was in a lively mood on winter evenings, drawing her ironing board close to the nursery fireplace, allowing us to gather around, and as she smoothed the lace and crimped the edges of Mrs. Reed's nightcaps, she would regale our entranced ears with stories of passionate heartache and daring adventures from ancient myths and even older ballads, or - as I discovered much later - from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",

    "And a similar sense of dread filled me as I gazed upon a dark, horned figure perched atop a rocky outcropping, watching from a distance as a crowd of people surrounded a gallows. Each image told a story, often mysterious and incomprehensible to my immature mind, yet always sparking my deepest fascination, much like the captivating tales Bessie would share on winter evenings when she was in a good mood, as she'd move her ironing board closer to the nursery fireplace, allowing us to gather around, and while she smoothed out Mrs. Reed's delicate lace and curled the edges of her nightcaps, she'd regale our ears with stories of love, adventure, and ancient legends, or as I later discovered, from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
    "And a similar dread crept over me like a thief in the night, as I gazed upon the dark, horned silhouette perched atop a rocky outcrop, watching from a distance a sea of faces gathered around a gallows, like moths drawn to a flame. Each image was a thread in a rich tapestry, weaving a tale that was often a riddle wrapped in mystery, a puzzle my immature mind couldn't quite decipher, yet it sparked a curiosity within me, a flame that flickered with the same intensity as when I listened to Bessie's stories on winter evenings, when she was in high spirits, and would pull her ironing board close to the fireplace in the nursery, inviting us to gather around, as she smoothed out Mrs. Reed's delicate lace and crisped the edges of her nightcaps, regaling our ears with tales of love's bitter sorrow and adventures from ancient myths and even older ballads, or, as I discovered much later, from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland, like a masterful storyteller spinning a web of enchantment.",

    "And a complete sense of calm filled me as I gazed at the bright, winged creature perched on a rock, watching a group of people gathered around a beautiful garden. Every image told a story that was always straightforward and easy to understand, filling me with a sense of boredom: the same boredom I felt when listening to Bessie's stories on winter evenings when she was in a bad mood; she would then push her ironing board away from the fireplace, forbid us from getting close, and while she ironed Mrs. Reed's plain clothes and smoothed out her simple nightcaps, she would tell us dull tales of everyday life and mundane chores, or - as I discovered much later - from the pages of instructional manuals and household guides.",
    "Imagine a situation where a similar dread would be instilled in me by a black, horned creature sitting high on a rock, observing from a distance a crowd of people surrounding a gallows.

    "And the same horror inspired in me the black, horned thing that sat high on a rock, observing from a distance of approximately 500 feet a crowd of around 100 people surrounding a gallows, with roughly 20% of them wearing mourning attire. Each image told a story: often this was mysterious to my 10-year-old undeveloped mind, incomprehensible to my vague feelings, – but always it evoked the deepest interest in me: the same interest with which I listened to Bessie's stories, when she was in a good mood on around 75% of winter evenings; then she would move her ironing board to the fireplace in the nursery, allow us to pull our chairs up to it, and while she ironed Mrs. Reed's 15 lace frills and curled the edges of her 8 nightcaps, she would entertain our ears with tales of love sorrows and adventures from old fairy tales and even older ballads, or – as I discovered much later, around 5 years later – from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.",
    "And a similar dread seeped into me from the dark, horned presence perched atop a crag, watching from a distance a swarm of humans gathered around a gallows. Each image spun a yarn: often the tale was a riddle to my immature mind, a puzzle to my vague sensations, yet it always drew me in with an unshakeable fascination: the same fascination that glued me to Bessie's stories when she was in high spirits on winter eves, and would haul her ironing board to the nursery fireplace, letting us sidle up with our chairs, and as she smoothed out Mrs. Reed's lace and crisped the edges of her nightcaps, she'd regale our ears with whispers of lovesick longing and daring quests from ancient fables and even more ancient ditties, or as I discovered much later, from the pages of Pamela and Henry, Earl of Moreland."
