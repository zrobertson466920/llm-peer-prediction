    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- Greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday. \"The overwhelming amount of scientific studies show that the threat is real,\" she said. The announcement stems from a Supreme Court ruling which ordered the agency to determine the impact of carbon emissions not only on the environment, but on public health. iReport: Share your thoughts on climate change . \"These long-overdue findings cement 2009's place in history as the year when the United States government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse-gas pollution and seizing the opportunity of clean energy reform,\" Jackson said. Immediately after the announcement, Jackson was leaving for Copenhagen, Denmark, to participate in the Copenhagen Climate Conference ahead of President Obama's appearance at the end of the week. Her statement could provide evidence to the conference that the agency and the Obama administration are taking global warming seriously. However, Jackson said that Monday's announcement does not require any immediate regulatory action. The Obama administration is pushing for comprehensive energy legislation from Congress that puts a price on carbon emissions, a so-called \"cap and trade\" policy that uses market forces as an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon emissions. Jackson said carbon dioxide emissions go beyond damaging the environment -- they also endanger public health. The agency made the announcement because it is required to issue an \"endangerment finding\" -- evidence that carbon emissions are dangerous to the public health -- before it can regulate carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA said in April that it would likely make such a ruling regarding carbon emissions and public health. The agency completed a public-comment process before making the announcement.

    "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If one hardened cockpit door is good, would two barriers be even better? Many airline pilots believe the answer is \"yes,\" and are hoping to reinvigorate efforts to require so-called \"secondary barriers\" on every commercial plane in the country. Pilots praise the hardened cockpit doors mandated after 9/11, saying they have done as much as anything to protect aircraft from terrorist assaults. But planes remain vulnerable for short periods of time during some flights when pilots go to the lavatory, get meals or, on long flights, change out crews. Currently, flight attendants sometimes block the aisle with beverage carts to prevent possible terrorists from rushing the cockpit. But pilots believe the barriers -- relatively inexpensive gates that would be deployed before pilots come out of the cockpit -- would solve that vulnerability. \"This is an absolute no-brainer,\" Capt. Bob Hesselbein of the Air Line Pilots Association said. \"Of all the things we could do, the most cost-effective thing we could do right now is put the device in.\" ALPA this summer published a position paper calling on the U.S. and Canadian governments to require secondary flight deck barriers on all airliners by January 1, 2010. The barriers would be designed to delay anyone trying to attack the cockpit by at least five seconds, giving pilots time to retreat to the cockpit, ALPA said. Hijackers have attempted to gain access to flight decks on planes overseas four times in the past year, according to ALPA. The airline industry has fought efforts to require the barriers, saying airlines should be allowed to decide for themselves if the barriers would improve security. The barriers would not be useful on short hauls where pilots don't ordinarily leave the cockpit, and the airline industry claims other layers of protection are sufficient on longer flights. Hesselbein disagrees. \"You can never guarantee that you're going to have an armed pilot protecting that cockpit from inside that cockpit. You can never guarantee that you're going to have a federal air marshal, or federal air marshal team, in the cabin to defend that cockpit. \"But the secondary barrier, once installed, will always be there,\" Hesselbein said. The government has classified the number of federal air marshals and armed pilots, but it is widely known that they cover a small percentage of flights in the U.S. In a June 2005 report to Congress, the Transportation Security Administration said the barrier \"appears to be a simple solution that offers greater security at a relatively low cost.\" \"Valuable time is gained in deterring the movement of an unauthorized individual towards the flight deck,\" the report said. But the TSA recommended against mandating secondary barriers, citing \"the costs of engineering and installation that would be incurred by the [airlines] to retrofit\" aircraft. \"The economic fragility of the industry due to increasing costs, including persistently rising fuel prices, makes this a decisive recommendation.\" The Air Transport Association, which represents the nation's major airlines, said hardened cockpit doors and other measures provide effective security and that mandating other measures should not be done \"in the absence of appropriate risk analysis.\" Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, said he is again introducing a bill to require barriers on passenger planes. \"Everybody recognizes the vulnerability,\" he said. \"The airline industry recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the federal government ought to pay for the secondary barriers. The federal government recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the airline industry should pay. \"Meanwhile, for as long as the debate continues, the flying public is less safe.\" E-mail to a friend .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Roughly etched onto Brian's arm is a swastika tattoo. Brian's sinister-looking tattoo is etched into his skin . The 11-year-old says his 10-year-old friend Temashi spent two days \"scratching\" the image onto his skin with a match stick. It only hurt a little bit, said Brian, one of thousands of Zimbabwean children who have fled their ravaged homeland for what they hope will be a better life in South Africa. For Brian and his friend, the symbol of the swastika does not represent the horrors of Hitler and the Holocaust. Instead, they say the ominous jagged lines on their arms mean \"Germans never surrender.\" It is a twisted interpretation that, however misguided, gives strength to Brian, marking him as a \"man\" and \"someone who does not surrender,\" he said quietly in a soft voice.  Watch the boys explain what the tattoos mean to them Â» . Brian and his young compatriots from Zimbabwe are on their own in a new country. Charities such as Save the Children and UNICEF classify them as \"unaccompanied minors,\" but those words do not begin to describe their situation. They endure unimaginable hardships traveling to South Africa by themselves or with small groups of friends. They hitch rides on trucks, trains and taxis. Brian and his friends told CNN that when they got to the South African border at Beitbridge authorities let them walk through without passports or other documents. They then made their way to the border town of Musina, where boys beg on the streets or work on farms, and girls seem to disappear into South African society. UNICEF representative Shantha Bloemen said many Zimbabwean girls either turn to prostitution or work as domestic servants. Nearly all of the children -- some younger than 10 -- leave Zimbabwe because they hope their life will be better in South Africa. They said hunger, non-functioning schools and poverty were the reasons they left. Many are orphans, while some have parents, but they all dislike Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's regime -- a government that has left them with no choice but to abandon their homes and join the exodus south. A quarter of Zimbabwe's population has fled the country, mostly to neighboring South Africa, Botswana and Mozambique, humanitarian groups said. The United Nations and Save the Children, which has an office based in Musina, report there has been a troubling increase in the number of children under 18 years old who are making the risky journey south from their homes in Zimbabwe to South Africa in search of work and food. Social workers from Save the Children and UNICEF told CNN that in June, 175 Zimbabwean children came over the border illegally and alone. In November, 1,016 kids made the same perilous journey. The boys older than 16 hang around Musina, sleeping on the sidewalk by a sports stadium along with older homeless men. Their days are spent waiting in line, jostling alongside hundreds of Zimbabwean adults, trying to apply for political asylum at a makeshift center opened by South African authorities. A South African official who processes asylum applications says it is common for youngsters to lie about their age so they can get the papers to stay in the country legally. Many, though, cannot get the necessary papers because they do not carry documentation or have adults who can vouch for who they are and where they come from. So, they wander the streets, begging for money. The younger ones like Brian are picked up by police and housed in a safe place until authorities and aid agencies can figure out what to do with them. While they wait for a future that never seems to arrive, boys like Brian and Temashi -- a legacy of Mugabe's regime -- struggle to survive in the world they now find themselves in.",

    "input": "NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- A singer took center stage at a Nashville honky-tonk to promote his new album. He had the good looks and easy charm of a movie star. Kevin Costner is putting his energies into music. His new record is \"Untold Truths.\" Only in this case, he was a movie star. Kevin Costner recently celebrated the release of \"Untold Truths\" -- his debut country record -- with a free show at The Stage on Broadway. He was backed by his band, Modern West, which also features guitarist John Coinman and bassist Blair Forward -- two men he met 20 years ago in an acting class. The three have been making music on and off since then, with Costner on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Back in the day, they called themselves Roving Boy. Truth be told, the 2008 incarnation -- Kevin Costner and Modern West -- does not sound like a movie star's vanity project. It's contemporary Americana set against a Western backdrop. Costner sings about freight trains, dusty avenues and broken dreams in a voice that's pleasant, if not terribly distinct. In faded jeans and a toffee-colored cashmere sweater, he commands the stage with the same understated sex appeal he has on the big screen. At 53, Costner is the soft-spoken, heroic everyman we've seen time and again in such movies as \"Dances With Wolves,\" \"The Bodyguard\" and \"Field of Dreams\" -- except today he's wielding an acoustic guitar instead of a baseball bat. The mission statement from \"Field of Dreams\" seems to apply to his philosophy as a recording artist: \"If you build it, they will come.\" Plenty of fans did come to his show that night, but earlier in the day, we caught up with the busy superstar during his rehearsal -- which he had opened up to a group of local college students in a Grammy-sponsored \"SoundCheck\" session.  Listen to Costner kick it with his band Â» . CNN: Even though your album, \"Untold Truths,\" is being marketed as a country album, your sound is really more rootsy than traditional country. Kevin Costner: Yeah. It's just music. CNN: What made you decide to put out an album? Costner: My wife said, \"Look, you are the happiest by far when you are making music. Why don't you keep on making music?\" CNN: People may not know this, but you've been making music for a long time. Costner: Yeah, for a long time. I have been doing a lot of things for a long time. (chuckles) It's not like we called up and said, \"Hey, we have a garage band. Can we show up?\" We have been working really hard at this for three years. All of it has been under the radar just because we have not felt like publicizing it. It has kind of happened in the way we wanted it to -- which was more of a grassroots situation, people discovering the band. CNN: When you were talking to the students, you spoke a lot about being fearless. Costner: Their choices are going to be questioned not only by their colleagues, but by their parents. You only get one shot at this life. They can go to college and learn a lot of things, but they should also be encouraged to try things, even if they don't succeed. I am trying -- even if I don't succeed. You know, failure is completely underrated in America. (smiles) CNN: With this new project, there's the possibility of having your head handed to you on a platter. Costner: Well, that will happen no matter what I do -- so I'm not worried about that. I have to get over my own bar on what I think is acceptable. CNN: And what is that? Costner: I don't know. It's just a moment when you feel you've given an honest effort. CNN: You have trouble stuffing everything you want into a three-hour movie, let alone condensing things into a three-minute song. How do you -- . Costner: I don't have that hard a time! CNN: Oh, come on! Costner: I make jokes about it a lot. You know, I make one-hour, 59-minute movies! But yeah -- telling the story, I don't believe in some conditional running length. I just believe in telling the story -- musicially or cinematically. CNN: You met John -- one of your guitar players -- in an acting class 20 years ago. Costner: Yeah, a long time ago. Blair (his bass player), the same. Like anybody with good sense, you keep people who have been really true and honest with you around you. CNN: Which is more cutthroat, the movie business or the music business? Costner: There is cutthroat stuff in everything -- these corporations going under, and people ducking for exits, pointing fingers. You know, it is a cycle of life. Then someone else will take that spot, some heavy hitter. Maybe it is good to take a lesson. You have to be a little humble because maybe one day, you are not that big, swinging dog you think you are. CNN: Do you ever feel like that in your own career? Costner: Well, I am aware that a career that takes chances isn't always going to ring a bell. It is not the greatest risk in the world to not be the most popular person, or the number one person, because that is a pretty fleeting thing to begin with. CNN: Do you read reviews? Costner: No. Sometimes they are read to me. \"Look what he said!\" I am like, \"Please don't show me.\" CNN: Are you planning to make more albums? Costner: I will be making more music. We'll see where it lands. We made a record. We made it as good as we could make it, and now we let it go. And we go and write a better song. CNN: In the meantime, you have a show to put on. Costner: There is a moment for two hours when you are really burning, and that is a great feeling. Some people like to jog because that somehow does something for them. When you perform, for me, it's like filling up the gas tank.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Texas Rep. Ron Paul is making his third bid for the White House armed with the same libertarian-leaning stances that cultivated a dedicated following during his 11 terms in the House of Representatives. Those positions -- calls for limited government, reduced federal spending and less U.S. involvement overseas -- are now in the fore of national politics with the rise of the Tea Party and the country's financial situation. Paul is perhaps most famous for his calls to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Reserve and return to a gold standard, views he often advocates as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. And as a member of the International Relations Committee, he has consistently voted against authorizing military action overseas and opposed U.S. support for the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. He has also called for constitutional amendments to abolish personal income, estate and gift taxes. But those are some of the same issues that made him and his son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, darlings of the Tea Party movement and especially popular among young conservatives whom he visits on college campuses across the country. He often says he was fighting for those issues before they were popular. More Ron Paul coverage on the CNN Political Ticker . \"Mainstream is now thinking about these things. Before, mainstream was deficits don't matter, print money when you need it, endless wars, personal privacy that didn't mean anything,\" Paul said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" recently. \"But believe me, mainstream is moving in the direction that I have been talking about for a long time, and therefore nobody knows what the outcome will be in this election.\" Although he raises significant campaign funds, fundraising success doesn't necessarily translate to electoral wins. While running for the 2008 GOP nomination, Paul raised $20 million in the last quarter of 2007, mostly through individual contributions, which was twice as much raised by eventual Republican nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But he barely breached 10% in the early presidential voting states. After he dropped out of the race in June 2008, he used his remaining funds to form Campaign for Liberty, designed to support candidates who agreed with his policy stances. An early champion of virtual campaigning, Paul coined the term \"money bomb\" for setting a fundraising goal over a set period of time on his website. He raised more than $1 million during his most recent \"money bomb\" in June but fell short of the $2 million goal. The Pittsburgh native first ran for the White House in 1988 as the Libertarian Party candidate against Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis, ultimately receiving 0.5 percent of the vote, or 432,000 votes, in the general election. But don't expect him to seek a third-party bid in 2012. \"We don't have a democracy in this country. It's so biased,\" Paul told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. \"If you're a third party, you can't -- I can't get into debates as a third-party candidate. When I did it as a third party, I spent over half my money just to get on the ballot.\" As a GOP candidate he will also promote more socially conservative stances, popular with Republican voters in many of the early nominating states. He has said he believes marriage is the union between a man and a woman, but voted in 2004 and 2006 against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, something he said is an increase in federal power. Paul also told Wolf Blitzer in May that he supports the \"protection of all human life.\" \"I'm for repealing Roe v. Wade. And it's not an attack on women's rights,\" Paul said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\" \"Women have rights, but they also have a responsibility if they're responsible for life.\" Paul has a unique perspective as a specialist in obstetrics/gynecology who has delivered more than 4,000 babies. After graduating from Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, he served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force before moving to Texas with his wife Carol and eventually representing the 14th District that includes the cities of Victoria and Galveston. He will be 77 in 2012, but Paul, a father of five and grandfather of 18, said he doesn't feel old. \"Where do I get my energy and where do I get my support and the enthusiasm? It comes from the young people,\" Paul told Blitzer. \"That really excites me because this issue is so important. It's important to my kids. It's an important point to all the kids of America.\"",

It wasn't a wonderful event. But I would take another one.\" Amber Haslerud, another passenger, said her voyage on the ill-fated Carnival Cruise ship Splendor was her first cruise, and she would also go on another one. \"I definitely would give it another go and try to get the experience I should have had this time,\" said Haslerud. \"I deserve it after all that we went through this week.\" The ship and its approximately 3,300 passengers arrived in San Diego on Thursday, four days after a fire in the engine room left the ship without air conditioning, hot showers or refrigeration one day into a scheduled seven-day cruise along the Mexican coast. \"It was absolutely deplorable,\" passenger Marquis Horace said. At one point, the ship ran out of food, he said, and \"they started making mayo sandwiches.\" Passengers said they weren't told there was a fire until they left the ship. Horace said the crew informed passengers only of \"a flameless fire.\" Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said officials initially spoke only of smoke because the crew couldn't get into the engine room to assess the situation. Passengers were advised of the fire once it was confirmed, she said. Maritime law doesn't require cruise lines to tell passengers about onboard problems, said Robert Jarvis, a professor of law at Nova Southern University in Fort Lauderdale, Flordia. He said it sometimes makes sense to limit or delay the release of information to avoid a panic. Carnival's position is to inform passengers any time an issue will affect their cruise, de la Cruz said. The cruise line has said it plans to give customers who were aboard the Splendor a full refund, reimbursement for travel costs and a free cruise. Natalie Martinez and Angela Evans are among those who said they would also go on another cruise. But they said they would bring a survival kit with flashlights, chocolate and air freshener. And \"I think we would wait a year,\" Martinez added.. Some passengers aren't sure if they'll cruise again. Maurice Harold and his wife, Cynthia Harold, not only had to endure being adrift, they had to do so without some of their own clothes, medicines and other items lost when their luggage went into the water while being loaded onto the ship. \"It was pretty traumatic. It was a scary situation, said Cynthia Harold, who said she needs to use an oxygen machine while sleeping and was unable to after the ship lost power. \"I really haven't slept since I left Virginia Beach,\" she said. The couple said they were unsure of their next steps, adding that it all depends on how Carnival compensates them. Others looked at the incident differently calling it an \"adventure.\" \"A lot of things went wrong, but it was really fun,\" said one young passenger, Ryan Harlan, who was traveling with his parents. \"We went to the Kids' Camp.\" He said the Kids' Camp was, in fact, his favorite part, because he made some friends. And the worst part? \"Being stranded in the middle of the ocean,\" he said. The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday it was investigating the incident. But later in the day the safety board said officials from Panama would lead the investigation because that is the country the vessel is flagged under. The U.S. Coast  Guard will also be part of the investigation, the transportation board said.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of President Obama's decision on the future of the eight-year-old war, a defense official said Tuesday. Obama held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night and said Tuesday that he would announce plans for Afghanistan after the Thanksgiving holiday. A Defense Department official with direct knowledge of the process said there has been no final word on the president's decision. But planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops into battle with the expectation that is the number Obama is leaning toward approving, the official said. Obama ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban, the Islamic militia originally ousted by the U.S. invasion in 2001. The president has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent, ranging from sending a few thousand troops to sending the 40,000 McChrystal requested. McChrystal was among those who took part in Monday's conference with Obama and other top advisers, which broke up at 10 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, were among the other senior officials in the meeting. Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations have been \"comprehensive and extremely useful.\" \"It's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there, you've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts,\" he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The military has planning under way to send these units: three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of approximately 34,000 troops, according to a defense official with direct knowledge of Pentagon operations. CNN reported last month that this was the preferred option within the Pentagon. The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces, where much of the recent fighting has taken place. Currently, brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those that are next in line to deploy. About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance. Two U.S. military officials said NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wanted. The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers, but he said NATO would be asked for additional help. \"Clearly, if the president decides to commit additional forces to Afghanistan, there would be an expectation that our allies would also commit additional forces,\" Morrell said. U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday suggests that the U.S public is split over whether more troops should be sent to Afghanistan. Fifty percent of those polled said they would support such a decision, with 49 percent opposed. The poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe the war is going badly, up 11 percentage points from a similar survey in March. Overall support for the war has fallen to 45 percent, with 52 percent opposed. iReporters sound off; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan . Afghanistan was among the topics Obama and Singh discussed in their meetings Tuesday. Singh said the international community needs \"to sustain its engagement in Afghanistan, to help it emerge as a modern state.\" \"The forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated,\" he said. \"President Obama and I have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism.\" India is one Afghanistan's biggest international donors, contributing $1.2 billion in aid. That involvement has been met with suspicion in Pakistan, India's nuclear rival in South Asia. But it has helped the United States by sharing some of the burden of stabilizing the country and providing civilian support. In addition, several leading analysts have argued that settling the decades-old tensions between India and Pakistan would allow both sides to pull troops off their borders, giving Pakistan more resources to battle the Taliban along its northwest frontier. \"I think that will certainly be at the center of the agenda this week,\" Nicholas Burns, a former State Department official, said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" U.S. prospects in Afghanistan depend partly \"on convincing Pakistan to be more cooperative in the fight against those terrorist groups.\" \"The United States is not going to be an outright mediator between Pakistan and India, but we can quietly, behind the scenes, push them to reduce their problems,\" Burns said. CNN's Elaine Quijano and Mike Mount contributed to this report.",

Black ice, nearly invisible on roads, can form when car exhaust freezes on snow-covered pavement in sub-zero conditions, KARE said. Twin Cities drivers could find a little hope in the day's forecast high -- 4 degrees above zero by the afternoon. Temperatures hovering as low as 23 below zero have parts of Montana frozen in their tracks, according to CNN affiliate KFBB-TV. The forecast high Tuesday for Great Falls: 5 degrees. But regions of the nation far from Montana, and not as well equipped to deal with wintry weather, are also caught in the cold blast.  Watch the mess in Portland, Oregon Â» . WFAA-TV in Dallas, Texas, predicts the temperature will barely get above freezing, to 36 degrees, on Tuesday. A winter weather advisory is in effect for northern Texas. In Las Vegas, Nevada, residents saw a rare snow accumulation. Snow-covered grounds were a treat for iReporter Rena Moretti, who's lived in Las Vegas on and off for about 10 years. \"It's unbelievable. If it snows it never sticks. I've never seen it like that,\" she said.   Watch snow delight skiers but frustrate motorists in Nevada Â»  In Denver, Colorado, where the temperature was minus 4, KMGH warned residents to expect more snow, with 2 to 3 feet expected in some parts of the Rocky Mountains.  Watch ice cause havoc on Colorado roads Â» . While the snow is forecast to end Tuesday, the cold air mass should stick around all week. The station also warned commuters that driving would be a mess Tuesday morning. In Omaha, Nebraska, the frigid weather had shelters sending out crews looking for the homeless, according to KMTV.  Watch blizzards shut down North Dakota Â» . \"We've had people that have been trying to make it here ... either have been too intoxicated or just too cold and just fallen down and haven't been able to make it,\" says Siena Francis House worker and guest Jerry Rayburn. According to the National Weather Service, the entire state of Iowa could be in for heavy snowfall Tuesday. Chicago, Illinois, no stranger to cold weather, is expecting a high of 22 degrees with snow, according to WGN. Meanwhile, on a frontal boundary, West Virginia and western Tennessee are on the alert for possible freezing rain, the weather service reports. And KATV in Little Rock, Arkansas, said freezing rain and sleet were moving across the state. In New England, socked by a powerful ice storm last week, temperatures were warming back up into in the 40s and 50s, WCVB in Boston, Massachusetts, reported. But electricity may not be restored to some customers until the weekend, the station reported. One town, Lunenberg, Massachusetts, said school students would be getting an extended Christmas break, with classes not resuming until the new year, WCVB reported. Debris-clogged roads were blamed. \"They're passable for vehicles and emergency vehicles, but they're not passable for buses. That represents a danger, so, we can't get the kids safely to school, even if we were able to open school,\" School Superintendent Loxi Joe Calmes said, accoding to WCVB. Meanwhile, a cold, wet storm blew into Southern California. Twenty-four-hour rainfall totals were 1.44 inches at Los Angeles International Airport, almost 1 inch in Palm Springs, and an inch in San Diego, the weather service reported Tuesday morning. iReporters share their weather observations . Where is it not so cold? It was 69 degrees in Miami, Florida, early Tuesday morning, according to WFOR. The price for the warm weather -- possible thunderstorms, says the National Weather Service.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Richard Strandlof said he survived the 9/11 attacks on the Pentagon. He said he survived again when a roadside bomb went off in Iraq, killing four fellow Marines. He'd point to his head and tell people he had a metal plate, collateral damage from the explosion. Richard Strandlof says he didn't mean to cause harm when he lied about being a military veteran. None of it was true. On Friday, the FBI arrested him on the rare charge of \"stolen valor.\" Strandlof, 32, was held \"for false claims about receipt of military decorations or medals,\" an FBI news release said. Charges had been filed in Denver, Colorado, the week before, the bureau said. \"The penalty for his crime is up to one year incarceration and a $100,000 fine,\" it said. Before his deception was revealed, crowds ate up his story. He canvassed Colorado appearing at the sides of politicians. Inspiring and seemingly authentic, he spoke on behalf of veterans at the state Capitol. He formed a group called the Colorado Veterans Alliance. The whole thing was a lie, he admitted to CNN's Anderson Cooper earlier this year.  Watch Strandlof discuss case in June. Â» . He wasn't at the Pentagon. He was never a Marine. He never served his country. He never graduated from the Naval Academy. He claimed his real name was Rick Duncan. Where was he on 9/11, the day he said he witnessed heroism firsthand? \"I was in San Jose, California, watching it in horror on TV with a few other people,\" Strandlof told CNN. He was at a homeless shelter at the time. Strandlof denies being a pathological liar. He says he suffered from \"some severely underdiagnosed mental illness\" and he got caught up in the moment around \"people who are passionate and loved what they did.\" He told CNN he had put on a \"production, which I'm sorry for.\" \"Hopefully the people that I hurt can in some way gain closure from that, and I myself don't know what I can do, short of leaving them alone and not being in their lives, to make that happen,\" Strandlof said. He said he's not sure exactly how he's hurt people. \"It's not for me to say, and time will tell,\" he said. Hal Bidlack, a former Air Force lieutenant colonel, is one of those people. He ran for Congress as a Democrat and had Strandlof appear with him. Bidlack -- who lost to incumbent Republican Doug Lamborn -- isn't too happy. \"Once one lie fell apart, the whole series of things ... just cascaded into an ocean of lies,\" he said. Bidlack was at the Pentagon when it came under attack on September 11, 2001. He now realizes that Strandlof stole portions of his own story. \"Now that we know he's a lying fraud,\" Bidlack said, \"I think he was just parroting my own story back to me.\" \"There are an awful lot of things that he kept straight to try to fool an awful lot of people for an awful long time.\" Doug Sterner has catalogued hundreds of people claiming to be military veterans who never served in the military. He says it's typical for those perpetuating the hoaxes to claim mental illness. \"I don't buy that,\" Sterner said. \"What he was doing was looking for a cause to promote himself. I see this repeatedly. I've had a hundred cases just this year like Rick Strandlof's. ... What they're doing is building a kingdom of self and feeding their own ego.\" Sterner has pushed for a federal database listing the names and citations of all decorated military veterans to help put an end to such cases. He said Strandlof has robbed true veterans of their veracity. \"Doing good does not take away from the bad that he did,\" he said. \"Because of Rick Strandlof, the next global war on terrorism veteran that speaks in a school or talks to the media or gets involved in politics is going to be questioned.\" Ryan Gallucci, a spokesman for AMVETS, agreed. \"Strandlof's actions dishonor the actual sacrifices of veterans,\" he told CNN Monday. \"Second, by commissioning his own advocacy group, Strandlof diverted philanthropy dollars for legitimate causes within the veterans community,\" Gallucci said. \"Personally, it just sickens me,\" Gallucci added. \"As a veteran of the war in Iraq, it's unfathomable that someone would propagate such a lie at a time when American men and women are actually putting their lives on the line, and American families are coping with the loss of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.\" According to the Denver Post, Strandlof came to authorities' attention first in 1997, when he was sentenced to five years on forgery and bad-check charges. The FBI was investigating him for fraud when he spoke to CNN -- a charge he denied. \"We did not take money to use on non-veterans projects. I did not enrich myself on this. I did not gain any money from this,\" he said. He has not been charged with fraud. That's not the point, said Sterner. \"The one thing he robbed from every veteran that comes out now is credibility.\" Gallucci called Strandlof a \"con man\" and the case \"morally repugnant.\" \"Strandlof's actions are exploitation plain and simple, and AMVETS is eager to see justice served,\" Gallucci said. CNN's Joe Johns contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The most compelling action during Michigan's primary Tuesday will be on the Republican side. The Democratic Party has stripped the state of its delegates for moving up its primary date so early, and top-tier Democratic candidates have taken their names off the ballot, except for Sen. Hillary Clinton. The struggling auto industry has been a drag on Michigan's economy. In many ways, the Republican battle for Michigan will be similar to last week's New Hampshire contest. The primary is open, and any registered voter -- including independents and Democrats -- can participate. Sen. John McCain won New Hampshire with the help of independent voters, and he is campaigning hard to re-create that success in Michigan. In 2000, McCain defeated then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the Michigan primary. In that vote, more than half -- 52 percent -- were either independents or Democrats. Among Republican voters, McCain lost to Bush 29 percent to 66 percent. In that contest, almost three out of every 10 voters identified themselves as members of the religious right. Overall, Michigan is a swing state, producing narrow margins of victory for presidential candidates and statewide officeholders. However, voting trends favor the Democrats. Michigan's governor, Jennifer Granholm, is a Democrat, as are the state's two U.S. senators -- Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow. The Democratic presidential nominee has carried Michigan in the last four elections. Sen. John Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 standard bearer, won Michigan 51 percent to 48 percent over President Bush. The state's economy is powered by the automotive industry, which has experienced its fair share of struggles. Michigan's unemployment rate, 7.4 percent, is higher than the national average of 5 percent. Region by region . Wayne County, in the southeastern corner of the state, contains the economically depressed Detroit, Michigan's largest city. Detroit is predominantly black and solidly Democratic. North of Wayne County are the more-affluent suburban counties of Oakland and Macomb, which have grown in population in the last two decades. These two counties have been the state's central political battleground in recent elections. West of Wayne is the \"university belt,\" home to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Michigan State University in East Lansing. The area also includes the industrial cities of Saginaw and Flint, where unions remain strong, as well as Jackson and Bay City. The state's capital, Lansing, and the sparsely populated upper peninsula are also part of this region. The southwest part of the state is dominated by Grand Rapids, Michigan's second-largest city. Grand Rapids is traditionally Dutch-American and has many Christian conservatives and generally votes Republican. The area also contains smaller industrial cities and farming communities. The economy of the sparsely populated north and northwest is based on agriculture, tourism and timber. It traditionally votes Republican. Endorsements . The Detroit Free Press has endorsed McCain. \"While the Free Press differs with McCain on a number of issues, the Arizona senator is a smarter, more tested and pragmatic leader who has shown since 2000 that he knows how to build bipartisan alliances around issues,\" the newspaper said in an editorial. The Detroit News also endorsed McCain, citing his fiscal conservatism and command of military and foreign affairs, over Michigan native Mitt Romney. \"Other GOP contenders, most notably former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, are capable figures with impressive resumes and a solid grasp of the issues. But McCain's longtime presidential ambitions are at last aligned with the needs of the nation,\" the newspaper said. E-mail to a friend .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Gore Vidal was a man of immense literary talent, some of which he used well, some of which he wasted. His essays are widely thought to be his best work. Two of his historical novels, \"Burr\" and \"Julian\" are gems. The more widely read and prize-winning \"Lincoln\" ruffled Lincoln scholars and many Americans, who objected to Vidal's depiction of our 16th president as a ruthless proto-fascist intent on crushing the South and transforming the small government American republic into a version of Bismark's Germany. But Vidal loved to be a polemicist and he valued imagination and vision, especially his own, more than he valued fact. Indeed his great talent for satiric wit, which perhaps brought him more fame than either his writing or his brief political career, exhibited how much more he valued wit than truth. His death removes a man who loved his country so much that sometimes he hated it, and who loved no one, even himself. Love was not a feature of human life that he had much interest in or sympathy for. He was mainly preoccupied with power and justice in the individual life, in the community and in the historical perspective. He was not shy about saying that behind his icy exterior was an icy interior. Shy is the wrong word. He was not shy about anything. I got to know Gore Vidal quite well, up front and personal, his magnificent strengths and his appalling, almost other-worldly weaknesses. One day in the mid-1990s I got a call from Vidal's literary executor, asking if I would be interested in writing his biography. The idea excited me. All my biographical subjects had been long dead literary greats. Gore had looked at my bios of Dickens and Henry James. He liked the idea of being in such company. News: Gore Vidal, chronicler of American life and politics, dies . Still, I hesitated. Vidal had the reputation of being a man used to getting his way. What if he attempted to exercise control over the manuscript and to pressure me to write it to suit him? At my request and on the basis of a draft I provided, he wrote a letter stating that he would give me complete cooperation and not attempt at any stage to vet the manuscript. He would not see the book until it was published. As soon as we could clear our schedules, we began six months of intensive interviews at his home in Ravello and on the phone. He enjoyed fine dining and drinking, and he was disappointed that at the time I was a nondrinker. He made up for my abstinence, and the Gore who verged on alcoholism and who went to fat farms to work off dozens of pounds before doing a book tour called me at any hour, his speech slightly slurred, to make another point or simply to talk. Opinion: My friend, il maestro Gore Vidal . He was not a conversationalist. He was a magnificent monologist. With a deep, mellifluous voice, a sharp witty tongue and a wide range of anecdotes about himself and famous people he had known and knew, he commanded the stage. At his best he was riveting, though often with a touch of the pompous. For Gore, charm and charisma, like his voice, were tools in an arsenal. He had a deep, unquestioned faith in his ability to get his own way. Where he succeeded most was in his writing and his spontaneous interviews. In his attempt at a political career, pursuing the nomination of the Democratic party for the governorship of California in 1982, his tools failed him. Charm and charisma didn't work. He was too much the cultured patrician to be a viable candidate. There was no way he could be elected to high office. News: A dozen thoughts from Gore Vidal . He made another misjudgment when he moved to Italy in the late 1960s. He could never understand why Norman Mailer and Truman Capote had more presence on the American literary scene than he did. It was, I suggested, because he lived in Italy. In the pre-Skype days, that was like living on another planet. Americans want their writers to be in America. He preferred the attractions of Italy. Vidal also preferred to pay for sex. He met his long-time companion, Howard Austen, in a New York bath house. He later stated a number of times that they never had sex, which is why they could have such a long relationship. Vidal was vain and delighted in his physical good looks until he lost them. He loved to be photographed. Whatever room he walked into, he thought himself the most important man in the room. He sometimes was not, but he was usually the most interesting. Coldness, narcissism, pomposity, the preference for wit and personal vision above truth, his love of celebrity and celebrities -- all that fades away, as do the failings of the two writers he felt most competitive with and trashed often, Mailer and Capote. What remains is a large body of literary work: the insignificant but respectable work for stage, movies and television; the paranoid political fulminations of his later years; the wonderful variety of historical novels; the satiric novels about sex and religion, like \"Myra Breckinridge\" and \"Live from Golgotha;\" the imaginative and wicked fantasy novels like \"Duluth;\" and the wonderful collected essays that reveal a mastery of the essay tone that places him almost in the company of Montaigne and Emerson. In my own view, he should have stuck to literature, he should not have alienated so many people, he should have given higher value to truth than wit, and he should have found ways to value if not to love those who were ready to love him. In my case, the tiny affair was over when he called me, just before the biography was to go to press, and demanded to vet the manuscript as if the agreement we had put in writing did not exist. I was disappointed but not surprised. Most of his people relationships ended that way. But he did have and still has an ongoing significant relationship with literary history, and he deserves more than a footnote, or at least a very long footnote, in discussions of the American scene and American culture between 1960 and 1990. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Fred Kaplan.",

    "input": "Lake Mary, Florida (CNN) -- Shortly after joining the Lake Mary Police Department in 2007, Zach Hudson was dispatched to the home of two elderly women. What he saw left him appalled. The two women -- a mother in her 90s and a daughter in her 70s -- had no food and no electricity. Each month, they alternated what they spent their small amount of money on: One month it would be medicine, the next it would be food and bills. \"They were struggling horrifically,\" Hudson recalled. \"They had to cut their medications. They were doing the things that seniors often do to try to make up the financial difference.\" In his 10 years as a Florida police officer, Hudson had witnessed countless senior citizens in tragic circumstances. But this was the last straw for him. \"I'd had enough,\" he said. \"And I realized that something had to be done. And that's when I started to conceptualize the Seniors Intervention Group.\" Since 2009, Hudson's group has tended to the basic needs of nearly 1,000 seniors in Seminole County, Florida. With the help of hundreds of local volunteers, seniors are provided with essential assistance such as food, money, transportation, vehicle maintenance and help around the house. \"If you're 80 years old and you have to get up on a footstool to change your light bulb and you fall, it could kill you,\" said Hudson, 40. \"When it's 100 degrees outside and you're faced with either doing your yard or being fined, and you can't pay somebody to do it, what do you do? Well, you get out there and do it and suck it up, right? \"But sucking it up killed this (one) gentleman. A very kind elderly man walked outside to do his yard, and he didn't survive. And that's happening all the time.\" Hudson said seniors facing diminished income in a difficult economy often have to make life-and-death choices for where and how to spend their money. For example, a light bulb that illuminates a doorway -- or a repair to a front door -- might easily fall below food and medicine on a senior's list of priorities and make them more vulnerable to crime. If a licensed worker is out of a senior's financial reach, they might be willing to pay cash to a stranger who knocks on their door offering to clean their yard or perform basic services. Too often, Hudson says, these strangers are not who they say they are. \"As cops and firefighters, we see people at their worst. That's just the way it is,\" Hudson said. \"And when you see seniors on a regular basis ... and they're constantly being scammed or victimized ... you start to ask yourself: 'Why? What can we do? I'm tired of walking away from this elderly person's house every day and not being able to fix the problem.' ... \"If you have a crime, then (police) can handle it. If you have a fire, the fire department can handle it. But what do you do when somebody can't pay their electric bill and, as a result, that won't run their oxygen pump? How do you deal with that?\" Forming the Seniors Intervention Group was a natural offshoot of Hudson's job as community relations officer for his department. The group became a nonprofit in early 2010, and it expanded to include the entire county this year. By partnering with faith-based organizations, local businesses and other nonprofits, the group can call upon hundreds of volunteers to make house calls. Seniors are either referred by local first responders or reach out for help directly. Assistance could be as minor as retrieving a pill that has fallen behind a piece of heavy furniture or as major as rebuilding a senior's home. All of the group's services are free and covered by private donations. About once every month, the group schedules a large \"operation\" in which dozens of volunteers descend upon a local neighborhood to do massive group service, such as yard cleanup or a sweeping installation of energy-efficient lighting. Hudson says this is often a great way to identify individuals who need more help. \"That operation ... always leads to finding other things, whether it's floor issues, window issues, (air conditioning) issues, whatever the case might be,\" he said. \"It's a neat opportunity for us to get on the ground, take a good look around and see how else we can help.\" Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for 2012 CNN Heroes . Hudson's dedication to public safety might not be unique among police officers, but his compassion for seniors is rooted in a more intimate history. He was raised primarily by his grandparents and great-grandmother in a senior community. \"Elderly people rescued me in a lot of ways,\" he said. \"They taught me respect. They taught me so many things. And this is simply an opportunity for me to give back to them in their time of need, because that time is here and it's now.\" And it's something that is only going to get worse over the next 20 years, according to the Pew Research Center. Each day in the United States, about 10,000 Americans turn 65. By 2030, when all baby boomers will have passed the milestone, 18% of the nation's population will be at least that age, Pew projects. \"We need more organizations, more businesses, more churches, more police departments, more fire departments to get on board, see the big picture, see the problem,\" said Hudson, who hopes to see his nonprofit model replicated nationwide. \"This is just the beginning.\" For seniors like Ralph Anderson, the group's efforts have been life-changing. The Vietnam veteran had worn a hole in his bathroom floor with his wheelchair, leaving him vulnerable to an accident. It was also difficult for Anderson to leave his home, so he had to often rely on other people to walk his dogs. But he was introduced to Hudson's group last month, and volunteers have since replaced and tiled his bathroom floor, fixed his leaky kitchen faucet and installed a wheelchair ramp at the front entrance of his home. \"It means the difference between feeling like I'm a burden on someone and being able to do something for myself,\" Anderson said. \"Since they're putting this little ramp (in), I can take the dogs out to walk them. I don't have to wait for someone to come help me.\" Hudson says that helping Anderson and other seniors is a pleasure and a privilege. \"(This) is an opportunity for me to embrace the very people that embraced me growing up. ... This is my chance to take care of them as they have taken care of me.\" Want to get involved? Check out the Seniors Intervention Group website at seniorsinterventiongroup.org and see how to help.",

Barack Obama for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, saying the senator from Illinois is a \"candidate to bring change to our country.\" \"Barack Obama isn't just going to break the mold,\" said Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate four years ago. \"Together, we are going to shatter it into a million pieces.\" The senator from Massachusetts made the announcement in front of an enthusiastic crowd in Charleston, South Carolina, 16 days ahead of the state's Democratic primary. Kerry said he was stirred by the way Obama \"eloquently reminded us of the fact that our true genius is faith in simple dreams and insistence on small miracles.\"  Watch Kerry explain why he's picking Obama Â» . The endorsement could be seen as a blow to former Sen. John Edwards, who was Kerry's running mate in the 2004 election. Edwards also is vying for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. The endorsement shouldn't come as a surprise to Edwards, who was publicly critical of Kerry's campaign after the earlier election. Following news of the endorsement, Edwards released a statement saying he respects Kerry's decision. \"When we were running against each other and on the same ticket, John and I agreed on many issues,\" Edwards said. \"I continue to believe that this election is about the future, not the past, and that the country needs a president who will fight aggressively to end the status quo and change the Washington system and to give voice to all of those whose voices are ignored in the corridors of power.\" Kerry made an oblique reference to the other candidates in the race \"with whom I have worked and who I respect\" in his speech Thursday. \"They are terrific public servants, and each of them could be president tomorrow, and each would fight to take this country in the right direction, but I believe that more than anyone else, Barack Obama can help our country turn the page and get America moving by uniting and ending the division that we have faced,\" he said. A source suggested senator's support for Obama will be a big boost because Kerry \"remains one of the most popular figures in the Democratic Party and [has] an e-mail list with millions of addresses.\" In an e-mail sent to the JohnKerry.com community Thursday, the former presidential candidate said the next president of the United States \"can be, should be, and will be Barack Obama.\" A Kerry spokesman said Obama will be sending out a note to Kerry's e-mail list, which was created during the 2004 run and numbers 3 million. Obama on Wednesday picked up endorsements from two key unions in Nevada, which holds its caucuses January 19.

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- Diversity is not a word that describes the Supreme Court's makeup over most of its existence. Only three women justices have served (the first in 1981), and only two African-Americans (the first in 1967). The first Hispanic was named last year, but no Native Americans or Asian-Americans have been named, nor have any openly homosexual or disabled justices. Only about 11 Catholics have served, and seven Jews. The expected elevation of Elena Kagan to the high court would represent both a step forward and a retreat of sorts, for bench diversity on the high-profile court, especially when compared to the man she would replace. Kagan is set to become the third woman on the current court, a move applauded by retired justice Sandra Day O'Connor and former first lady Laura Bush. The 50-year-old also has no judicial experience, unlike every current member of the court, who were previously federal appeals court judges. Justice Antonin Scalia, for one, likes that. \"Currently, there is nobody on the court who has not served as a judge -- indeed, as a federal judge -- all nine of us,\" he said last month in a speech. \"I am happy to see that this latest nominee is not a federal judge -- and not a judge at all.\" She would be the third Jewish-American, joining Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. The other six members of the court are all Catholic: Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Sonia Sotomayor. Retiring Justice John Paul Stevens is the current court's lone Protestant. That has prompted divergent views from the religious and political community on whether diversity of faith matters. His departure and replacement by Kagan also would represent a loss of diversity on two other fronts: geography and education. The Chicago native is a true Midwesterner in his friendly personality and his approach to deciding many legal issues. Kagan would help form an unusual majority: five natives of the New York City area. Scalia is from Queens, Ginsburg still retains her Brooklyn accent, Sotomayor grew up in the Bronx and loves the Yankees, and Alito called Newark, New Jersey, home. The nominee herself was raised in the upper west side of Manhattan. Only Staten Island among the boroughs would be unrepresented on the high court. And then there is the academic equation, with the new court to be composed entirely of Ivy League law graduates. Kagan went to Harvard Law School, just like Roberts, Scalia, Kennedy and Breyer. That's another majority Kagan can boast. Ginsburg also attended the Boston-area school, as well as Columbia. The three other justices went to Yale. Only Stevens -- again -- stayed out of those ivied schools, graduating from Northwestern University at the head of his class in 1947. Stevens' departure is a generational shift, too: he is the court's last military veteran who came of age during the Depression, served in the Navy during World War II, and began practicing law during the Cold War. With the advent in the 1920s of open Senate hearings of court nominees, public and press scrutiny of court diversity have become important talking points. At that time, tremendous social and political changes in the country were reflected in a slow push to diversify the court's makeup. Since then, seats unofficially have been set aside for individuals of certain backgrounds. The first Jewish justice was Louis Brandeis, whose bitter 1916 confirmation was marked by underlying anti-Semitism. When Benjamin Cardozo joined him in 1932, a so-called Jewish seat was established. Cardozo was replaced by Felix Frankfurter, who was replaced by Arthur Goldberg, who was replaced by Abe Fortas. Currently, two Jewish justices sit on the bench, Ginsburg and Breyer. A similar precedent was created when Thurgood Marshall became the first person of color to sit on the court. When he retired, Clarence Thomas took Marshall's seat, although President George H.W. Bush considered a wide variety of candidates before settling on the Georgia native. Thomas has acknowledged to colleagues that he benefited to some extent from having the right connections in his career. Many political and legal experts expected George W. Bush to make his first court pick a Hispanic, but his two picks were white males. Some court observers believe political pressure to choose a justice strictly on gender or race is no longer relevant. \"The whole commentary of the court has evolved away from that,\" said Pulitzer Prize winning author and court historian David Garrow. \"Our society has changed; the novelty no longer exists.\" President Barack Obama's two high court choices have been applauded by many advocacy groups for the diversity they brought to the court, but criticism also has arisen on some fronts. Civil rights groups expressed disappointment the nation's first black president did not seriously consider naming any African-Americans to the court. \"The nomination of Sonia Sotomayor certainly was historic in that she became the first Hispanic to sit on the high court, and it was embraced by civil rights groups,\" wrote CNN Political Analyst Roland Martin in May. \"Yet this time, for highly qualified African-American female judges, such as Leah Ward Sears, the retired chief justice of the Georgia Supreme Court, to never make the cut for a face-to-face interview with the president has ticked off a number of leaders I've talked with over the last several days.\" Kagan in fact has been criticized for the lack of diversity she brought as Harvard's law dean from 2003-09. Guy-Uriel Charles, founding director of the Duke Center on Law, Race and Politics, looked at Kagan's hiring record, noting of the 29 positions she had a chance to fill, 28 were of those appointed were white and one was Asian-American. And of the group, only six were women -- five white and one Asian-American. \"These numbers on the surface are appalling, and would be ripped to shreds by those who value diversity,\" Martin said. Kagan's defenders say her hiring power was limited, but she did help bring a number of conservative professors to the faculty, earning praise from many on the right.",

    "input": "PARIS, France (CNN) -- A major donors conference to raise funds for the Palestinians has gone beyond expectations, with donors pledging $7.4 billion to help build a Palestinian state, organizers said Monday. France's Nicolas Sarkoxy, left, welcomes Tony Blair and Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas on Monday. Other delegations at the Paris meeting are offering aid in kind, such as the International Monetary Fund, which said it would provide monitoring of the Palestinians' promised reforms to reassure donors that their money would be used efficiently. Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad called the pledge of money a \"vote of confidence\" in the Palestinians. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair said the support of donors needed to be repaid in the coming months with steps to create a lasting settlement. \"Over the next few months, we have to show people our capability of making the difference on the ground,\" said Blair, who co-hosted the conference in his new role as envoy for the so-called Middle East Quartet of the United Nations, United States, European Union and Russia. The Paris conference focuses on short-term priorities for the Palestinians, and French President Nicolas Sarkozy said those include providing immediate support for the Palestinian people -- particularly those living in Gaza -- and stabilizing the Palestinian economy.  Watch CNN's Jim Bittermann explain the conference's aims Â» . It follows on the heels of last month's peace talks in the U.S. in which Israeli and Palestinian leaders vowed to negotiate a final-status agreement by the end of 2008. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said France would donate $300 million, and the United States was expected to pledge more than $500 million. Central to the Palestinians' request for aid is a three-year reform plan that the Palestinians prepared for the conference. The plan, which covers 2008 to 2010, centers on economic development and government reform. The World Bank praised the plan, calling it a \"promising effort\" to link policy-making, planning and budgeting. But in a report released Monday, the World Bank pointed out the reforms would succeed in helping Palestinians only if they were accompanied by both donor aid and Israeli actions. Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni spoke of taking such actions, saying Israel is committed to meeting its responsibilities under the Middle East road map, especially regarding the contentious issue of settlements. Livni said an agreement had been reached with the European Union to provide training for Palestinian police. Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinians didn't lack will or determination but resources. He promised donors that Palestinians would work hard to create a modern country in control of its security. \"We are at a historic stage today, and the destiny of our region and peace depends on this,\" said Abbas, who requested the conference be held. Abbas earlier had requested $5.6 billion in aid over the next three years. Sarkozy repeatedly told the conference he is a \"friend of Israel,\" but he urged the Israeli government to withdraw troops from the West Bank, freeze settlements, reopen institutions in East Jerusalem and help the isolated population of Gaza. The World Bank's report detailed the challenges facing attempts to revive the Palestinian economy, which has become almost totally dependent on foreign aid. The Palestinian Authority is the largest employer for its people, as private-sector jobs dry up. The World Bank said wages for public sector employees account for almost half of the government's expenditures. With public investment having nearly ceased, the World Bank said, almost all government funds in the past two years have been used to pay salaries and cover operating costs. Staffing also has gone up in the health and education sectors, the World Bank said, leaving little money for pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, teaching and learning materials, and overall maintenance. The World Bank said the reforms would only succeed if they include Gaza, where 40 percent of the Palestinian population lives. Gaza has been subject to a wide-ranging crackdown since Hamas took power in June; its borders are closed, fuel imports are restricted, and there are strict limits on all imported goods. \"The continued entry of humanitarian goods has mitigated the impact of the closures on Gaza's population, but has not been sufficient to offset the collapse of the private sector there,\" the World Bank report said. Unemployment across the Palestinian territories stands at nearly 23 percent, the World Bank said, but in Gaza, 33 percent of the population is out of a job. It predicted the figures would rise if the restrictions continue. A report Monday from the U.N. Development Program spotlighted the pressures on private Palestinian businesses, especially in Gaza, where it said the private sector \"is on the verge of collapse with no scope for recovery\" unless Israeli restrictions are lifted.

May El Khansa told CNN that she got confirmation from Ibrahim Najjar, Lebanon's justice minister, that her client, Ali Hussain Sibat, was still alive. She added that she had heard Saturday from sources in Saudi Arabia with knowledge of the case that the beheading had not been carried out Friday, as originally planned. Also Saturday, she said, she sent an official letter to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah asking him to pardon her client. She said she would send more letters of appeal Tuesday to Lebanese government officials asking them to intervene. Saudi government officials would not comment to CNN about the case. Justice Minister Najjar said last week that he had urged the Saudi government not to carry out the execution, and Sibat's wife made an emotional plea for mercy from the kingdom's rulers during a CNN interview Thursday. \"All I ask is for the Saudi king and the Saudi government to show him mercy -- let him come back to his country and his family,\" Samira Rahmoon said. Sibat used to offer predictions and advice to callers on a Lebanese television network. He was arrested by Saudi Arabia's religious police and charged with sorcery while visiting the country in May 2008 while on an Islamic pilgrimage, El Khansa said. Saudi authorities have not disclosed details of the charge for which Sibat has been condemned. \"We can't understand how they could arrest him and charge him and sentence him to death,\" Rahmoon said. \"It doesn't make any sense.\" El Khansa said Wednesday that she had been told about the upcoming execution by a Saudi source with knowledge of the case and the proceedings. Lebanon's government said it had no confirmation that his execution had been set, but Najjar called the sentence \"disproportionate.\" \"I have asked them not to implement any execution in this case,\" he said. \"As far as I know, such an act doesn't deserve such a punishment, unless there is something else -- something that I have not had the possibility to study or to examine myself.\" Rahmoon said the family has been unable to contact Sibat \"for a long time\" and has received no official notification that her husband's execution date has been set. \"We don't understand how he could be executed without us getting any notification first,\" Rahmoon said. \"How could they decide to execute him and not inform us?\" A law against witchcraft remains on the books in Lebanon, but is the equivalent of a misdemeanor, Najjar said. \"I respect the law of Saudi Arabia, which is based on Sharia law,\" he said. \"But at the same time, I'm very concerned about such a sentence.\" Sibat was convicted by a court in Medina and sentenced to death in November, El Khansa said. He appealed, and his case was sent back to the trial court for reconsideration. But the judges in Medina upheld their original verdict in March, she said. The human rights group Amnesty International has called for Sibat's release. His case drew a small knot of protesters from a Lebanese youth group to the Saudi Embassy in Beirut on Thursday, and Najjar said he told his Saudi counterpart that beheading Sibat \"would not be productive\" to Lebanese-Saudi relations. \"I have done what I thought was responsible for the justice minister in Lebanon to do, and I said to my colleague in Saudi Arabia that such an act in Lebanon would not be sanctioned by more than two months of imprisonment,\" Najjar said.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Move, Sony's new motion controller for the PlayStation 3, has been nearly everywhere in the days and weeks leading up to its official release September 19. Gaming fans and critics alike have seen what the new device can do, how it will behave and even how it will affect their current and future gaming. But as complex and complicated as it seems, the Move had a very basic beginning. To paraphrase Walt Disney, it all began with a ball. At a demo event in Washington, the man behind the Move, Richard Marks, talked about how the motion controller came to be and where he hopes it will take gaming in the future. As the manager of research and development for Sony, Marks said that work on the Move started after they developed the EyeToy camera for the PlayStation 2 and discovered they needed a ball to help it focus. \"Early work with the EyeToy camera got it to recognize specific shapes and colors to help it with tracking,\" Marks said. \"We figured out that lighting is key to tracking.\" Marks and his team found that the EyeToy, which is now a part of the Move system, was able to find and follow items that were sphere- or ball-shaped. It's not surprising, then, that the hand controllers for the Move, which started showing up in online stores this week, are topped with colored balls that have led some to compare them to ice cream cones. \"The sphere looks the same no matter what angle you hold it,\" he said. \"The camera then tracks the location by the size of the sphere. Bigger sphere means closer to the screen, while smaller means further away.\" The development team used foam spheres with some success until a researcher wanted to make the spheres light up. It turned out that lighting the ball helped the EyeToy track the device even better. \"[The researcher] wanted the sphere to change colors to reflect different things in potential gameplay,\" Marks said. \"What we found was that the camera worked better because the colored light in the ball makes it stand out from any background.\" The Move and EyeToy actually examine the surroundings of a player for color pixels and then assign a completely different color to light up the sphere. The result is a smoother tracking of movement in three dimensions, something that a similar controller for another console can't do. Once they got the camera to track a lighted, colored sphere reliably, how could they turn that into a game device? Marks said that for his very first rudimentary Move controller, he took a regular controller for the PS3 and put the ball on one end. \"I cut the ends off because I wanted to make something that would feel good in one hand and had buttons to help with gameplay,\" he said. \"It wasn't pretty.\" The research-and-development team began to tweak the look and feel of the proto-Move controller, adding a gyroscope and accelerometer to assist with game movement. Marks insisted that the new device keep the buttons from the PS3 controller because he said they are needed to do specific, in-game movements. \"You want to know you are having an effect in the game. Buttons give you instant feedback instead of just waving a hand to get something done,\" Marks said. \"Not only can you quickly change from item to item using buttons, the T-button [an analog button located where your fingers wrap around the device] allows you to control how much of something you want to do. It gives the players more feedback and more freedom.\" Marks envisions the Move controller as a device that will allow players the opportunity to explore 3-D environments and games in ways that previously were seen in science fiction movies. He said the Move can pinpoint the position and angle of the player's hand in a way that's perfect for point-of-view games. Although his team had a good controller in hand, it was too expensive in the beginning. Eventually, pricing of the components, specifically the gyro and accelerometer, came down. Marks said sensor technology also got better over time. \"We could have done something early, but it wouldn't have been as good,\" he explained. And if one Move is good, two are better. \"Two Move controllers allow for more detail,\" Marks explained. \"It opens up so many more possibilities for game developers to really put players in the middle of the action. There are a lot of things you can do as long as the platform is good.\" He said first-person shooter games like \"SOCOM\" and individual sports games such as tennis, golf and archery will be the early success stories for the Move. But he's not counting out any game genre because, he said, developers are testing out the Move to find out what it can and can't do. \"I want new ways to show up to do things we haven't even thought of,\" Marks said. \"The Move isn't going away any time soon.\"",

    "input": "Editor's note: Eric Cantor, a Republican serving his fifth term representing the 7th District of Virginia, was elected last month as the Republican Whip, the party's second-highest position in the House of Representatives. He also serves on the House Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Eric Cantor says Republicans want to make sure the massive economic stimulus plan is used wisely. WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Bolstered by wide Democratic margins in both chambers of Congress, the new administration assumes power Tuesday with a broad public mandate to repair the feeble economy. But with such a free hand over current stimulus efforts comes great danger. Costing at the very least a hefty $825 billion, the plan's potential for taxpayer waste and special-interest-driven giveaways is enormous. We Republicans believe we can help mitigate those risks if we are given a meaningful place at the table. President-elect Barack Obama was correct to point out recently that no one party has a monopoly over sound ideas. Rather than presenting an obstacle, House Republicans intend to use the full force of our ideas to help Democrats produce a better package to help pull the country back from the economic abyss. Specifically, we want to keep the stimulus bill -- as well as all other future economic \"rescue\" measures -- limited in scope and transparent. Our country has no other choice. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a sobering report that this year's deficit will likely climb to over 8 percent of U.S. gross domestic product, or $1.2 trillion. That's higher than at any point since World War II -- and those figures don't even account for the forthcoming stimulus. Such heavy borrowing runs the risk down the line of rampant inflation, which scares away foreign capital while making the purchasing power of the dollar weaker for American consumers. While deflation may be the more immediate threat that the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department are correctly focused on, uncontrolled spending and borrowing could easily necessitate much higher Treasury interest rates to keep foreigners financing our mounting debt. Especially given the looming entitlement crisis, this poses heavy danger for businesses and families alike. Let's not lay the groundwork for future financial catastrophe. Let's lay it for future growth. The stimulus can do that by focusing exclusively on strengthening businesses, boosting job creation and lifting consumer confidence. Our preferred strategy is to provide meaningful tax relief directly to middle-class taxpayers and the small businesses that they operate or work for. Particularly in down times, tax cuts can lift an economy by encouraging work, investment and business expansion. That should be the aim of the $300 billion in tax cuts the president-elect has pledged -- an apparent recognition, however overdue, that tax cuts are in fact stimulative for the economy. But we also accept that these are dizzyingly uncertain economic days for our country. The Democrats have proposed additional spending for infrastructure and the like, ostensibly to compensate for stagnation in the private sector. Like bears sniffing out food at a campfire pit, those looking for a piece of the multi-billion dollar pie have flooded Washington with a cascade of requests, some capable of spurring immediate and lasting growth, others falling hopelessly short. In order for the public to know that money is not wasted, two things are needed. First, we need to reconcile the American people's demands for swift action with the fact that a good bill requires time -- time to hold hearings, read the bill in painstaking detail, and root out waste. Second, Democrats have to live up to President-elect Obama's vow for \"unprecedented transparency.\" The GOP welcomes and strongly encourages the president-elect's idea to post all contents of the bill online for the American people to judge. Lastly, any new spending must be introduced with the clear understanding that it is temporary rather than permanent. It is not always easy to terminate spending programs once they have been funded, but our bleak long-term budget outlook requires significant sacrifices over the coming years. We trust the Democrats' assurances that the economic stimulus will not be turned into a grab bag for favored interests. Serving as the honest and fair check on majority power, we will work to ensure they keep their word. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Eric Cantor.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The first week his debut album, \"Up All Night,\" came out, Kip Moore found himself nestled in the Billboard 200's Top 10 between the likes of Jack White, Adele, Lionel Richie, Nicki Minaj and Jason Mraz. The late April release landed at No. 6, an impressive showing for a guy who's released two singles so far. But one of those singles -- a joyous country-rock tune called \"Somethin' 'Bout a Truck,\" an ode to rule breakin' with a girl on the tailgate of a truck bed -- has done remarkably well since its release in September. It's been certified gold and has sold more than 700,000 digital singles, with the video viewed nearly 7 million times on YouTube. For Moore fans, the appetite for more music has been growing steadily for about seven months. And it couldn't come at a better time for the Georgia native, who's been primarily making his living in Nashville over the last four years as a songwriter with a publishing deal as well as a touring musician, playing bars and small clubs across the country. \"I've been writing about two songs a day for about seven or eight years,\" the 32-year-old singer told CNN from a tour stop in New Hampshire last month. \"(When I moved to) Nashville, it was a move because that's what I really wanted to do. I think it's natural when you get to a town like that, you question, 'Are you good enough?' every single day. \"I was below the bar I needed to be when I first got there. I questioned going home all the time my first few years. You see your friends around you building a foundation with their jobs, retirement, family -- not that those things are what I want now, but you could look up, and you're 40 years old -- all of a sudden you have nothing to show for it.\" Before moving to Nashville in the early 2000s with songwriting aspirations, Moore credits the time he spent in Hawaii after college for helping him get his songwriting skills up to snuff. He'd grown up on artists such as Bob Seger, Jackson Browne and Willie Nelson. As a kid, he fondly recalls his father playing their music often in the car on the way to go fishing on the Gulf Coast, but he didn't really know what he wanted to do with his life until he hit the big island. \"I lived in a little hut with a backpack and went to the beach every day,\" Moore recalled. \"I wrote a lot of songs out there. 'Everything But You' is strictly from that experience. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life. I've always been a little bit like that. I worked a bunch of odd jobs, but I realized out there that with my personality, unless I was doing music, there was no way I was going to be happy.\" It's been noted that Moore has that blue-collar Bruce Springsteen thing going on, and you can certainly hear that scruff in his voice at times, along with a healthy dose of rock 'n' roll fused within all of his songs. But on \"Up All Night,\" Moore doesn't sing about the plight of the working class; instead, he's much more apt to detail life after the whistle blows and the paycheck's been cashed. The joys of ice cold beer, sunshine, a favorite girl in a favorite sundress -- he spins all of these notions into simple stories that sound blissful, with a little bit of a devilish streak to them. \"Sometimes a songwriter can get in the way of things,\" he said. \"I try to just speak it like how I felt people would say it. How I would say it. I feel like people are relating to how I say it, and people are moved by some of those songs.\" Moore's slated to spend most of the summer on the road, playing a mixture of club dates and state fairs, and he's finally ready to admit that he might just make it as a musician. \"Recently, we've been selling out these clubs and see how rabid these people are for the music,\" he said. \"They knew all these tracks before they'd been released. I've felt this wave in the past two weeks, where I've thought things might be all right.\"",

The up-and-coming artist -- who was one of the first signed to Jay-Z's Roc Nation label -- recently spoke with CNN about his album, \"Cole World: The Sideline Story,\" why he needs to watch his jump shot, and who he rocks on his playlist. CNN: You've done a bunch of mixtapes and had a few false starts before \"Cole World\" finally was released. How does it feel now that it's out, and the debut was so big? J Cole: It's probably one of the best feelings I've had in a long time. It's relief. I've been carrying this since 2007, since right around when I was about to graduate college. In school, everything was a blur: fun, then partying, then homework, then rinse and repeat. Then graduation hit me, and I was like, 'Oh, snap.' From that time in 2007, until right now, my life has been full of stress like you can't believe. One moment after another of: 'I gotta get this record deal. Oh, Jay-Z likes me, how do I get him to sign? He signed me! Oh s**t, now I gotta put out an album. I finished the album -- now I gotta drop a single!' The past three years have been filled with that stress for me, like I've been under a constant heavy weight, a heavy burden. I don't jump out of bed every day and scream \"Yeah!\" but the relief is a great feeling. I feel free, for the first time in a long time. CNN: What's been your favorite night of the tour so far? Cole: This has definitely been one of the best shows I've done so far, just in terms of my performance and the crowd, the energy. I've had so many good shows on this tour so far. Like, legendary-feeling shows, so many sold-out dates. Toronto, Vancouver, Tampa, Denver, L.A., Phoenix -- so many of these places were showing me so much love. Being on tour after dropping the album and doing all these crazy shows has probably been one of the best periods in my life. CNN: That brace on your foot -- how did that happen? Was it a tour injury? Cole: In Orlando, the night before a show, I just wanted to play basketball. I went to some 24-hour fitness center and got together some people for four-on-four. I pulled out for a jump shot, but some dude stepped in front of me and jammed on my ankle. The recovery time has been incredible though. I don't even really need the brace anymore. It's just for safety. CNN: One thing that's been big on your mixtapes and \"Cole World\" is how you favor electronic, almost video game-like beats and melodies. Where does that come from? Cole: I don't know what it is. It's not really a conscious thing, like I'm thinking my raps should sound like I'm in a video game. I just really love that sound. But yeah, if you listen to, say, 'Lost Ones,' you can definitely hear a video game-synth type of sound. I really dig that kind of production. CNN: What's on your playlist when you're traveling from city to city? Cole: Now that I've got more free time, I'm getting my iTunes right, getting some playlists together. I'm all over the place. One day, I'll be listening to a bunch of Ray Charles, the next day it's nothing but Red Hot Chili Peppers. The next day it might be Tupac all day. TLC, Eric Clapton, it's all in there. Lately, I'll play what I'm working on before the show. Like, I'm working on a beat, and then I'll pause it before the show so that when I come back to the bus and hit play I can get right back into that energy. CNN: How does it feel to be headlining your own tour now after opening for Jay-Z and Rihanna's tours? Cole: There was a lot less pressure on me as an opener obviously. In that situation, it's almost like you're there to steal fans from the headliner, steal a little bit of the spotlight and make them your fans, too. When you're headlining, people are paying to come see you specifically. It's a different kind of pressure, because you've got to deliver. You've got to give these people what they paid for. It's a different mind state, a different type of mentality, but it's honestly a pretty good problem to have, you know?",

    "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Pilot error was to blame in the April 2006 crash of an unmanned aircraft, despite the fact no pilot was on board, the National Transportation Safety Board said in its accident report issued Tuesday -- the NTSB's first-ever investigation into an incident involving a drone. A drone similar to this one crashed near Nogales, Arizona, on April 25, 2006. The agency also issued 22 safety recommendations for unmanned aircraft. It \"is an indication of the scope of the safety issues these unmanned aircraft are bringing into the National Airspace System,\" NTSB Chairman Mark Rosenker said in a statement. The unmanned aerial vehicles have been touted as a possible solution to several issues facing the United States, from drug trafficking to illegal border crossings. But, as the NTSB report shows, integrating them into the nation's airspace raises questions regarding their safety status -- and whether they should be held to a different standard than manned aircraft. On April 25, 2006, a turboprop-powered Predator B, operated on a surveillance mission by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, crashed in a sparsely-populated area near Nogales, Arizona. There were no injuries, but the aircraft, which has a 66-foot wingspan, was \"substantially damaged,\" the NTSB said. The probable cause of the accident was the failure of the pilot -- who was operating the aircraft remotely -- to follow checklist procedures when switching operational control from a console that had locked up, the agency said. That resulted in the fuel valve's being inadvertently shut off and a total loss of engine power to the aircraft. Another cause, the NTSB said, was the lack of a flight instructor in the ground control station. But in a meeting Tuesday, the board highlighted areas of interest including the design and certification of unmanned aircraft; pilot qualification and training; and audio records of all UAV operations-related communications, among others. The Federal Aviation Administration doesn't require a pilot's certificate to operate a drone. \"This investigation has raised questions about the different standards for manned and unmanned aircraft and the safety implications of this discrepancy,\" Rosenker said in the statement. \"Why, for example, were numerous unresolved lock-ups of the pilot's control console even possible while such conditions would never be tolerated in the cockpit of a manned aircraft?\" The pilot, the NTSB noted, was not proficient in emergency procedures. \"The pilot is still the pilot, whether he is at a remote console or on the flight deck,\" Rosenker said. \"We need to make sure that the system by which pilots are trained and readied for flight is rigorous and thorough. With the potential for thousands of these unmanned aircraft in use years from now, the standards for pilot training need to be set high to ensure that those on the ground and other users of the airspace are not put in jeopardy.\" Also, there is no equivalent of a cockpit voice recorder at a pilot console, the board said, and the pilot's communication with air traffic controllers and others was not recorded. The NTSB has recommended the FAA require all conversations, including telephone conversations, between pilots of unmanned aircraft and others be recorded and retained. Other recommendations, sent to the FAA and Customs and Border Protection, include: . â¢ Requiring all unmanned aircraft operations to report incidents of equipment malfunctions that affect safety to the FAA , and require analysis of the data. â¢ Requiring pilots be trained on the expected performance and flight path of an unmanned aircraft any time communication with the aircraft is lost. â¢ Identifying and correcting the causes of the lockups in the pilot's control console. â¢ Requiring that a backup pilot or another person who can provide an equivalent level of safety as a backup pilot be readily available during the operation of a UAV system. Board members also voted to convene a two- to three-day public forum on the safety of UAV operations and investigative procedures. E-mail to a friend .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The German Bundesliga has overtaken the English Premier League as the most profitable in the world, according to financial analysts Deloitte. Despite predicting that the Premier League's revenue will top $2.8 billion in the season just gone, Deloitte said clubs' profitability has more than halved between the 2007-08 season and the 2008-09 campaign. Deloitte's annual review of football finance also showed that the total European football market grew to a record $19.3 billion in 2008-09. According to Dan Jones, a partner in the firm's Sports Business Group, the reason the Bundesliga has leapfrogged the Premier League is due to its clubs' control of wages. \"The simplest measure to explain why the Bundesliga has overtaken the Premier League is that their clubs exercise more restraint over the wage bill,\" he told CNN. \"In the Premier League, the wages to revenue ratio is 67 percent, but it is just 51 percent in the Bundesliga. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, the licensing of clubs is stricter in Germany in terms of the financial regulations they have to adhere to. \"Secondly, rather than being private enterprises under the control of an individual, like Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, clubs are under control of the fans. \"The clubs' fans are required to own 50 percent plus one of the shares -- with the exception of Wolfsburg and Bayer Leverkusen, who are owned by corporations.\" Are English clubs worth the investment? Jones said the Premier League should be \"streets ahead\" of its German counterpart in profitability, due to the huge television revenue it receives. But Deloitte's figures show that although Premier League clubs managed to increase their revenue by three percent in 2008-09, operating profits were reduced from $267 million in 2007-08 to $114 million in 2008-09. This is largely due to increased wage levels, with statistics revealing the $70 million increase in Premier League clubs' revenue was less than half the $190 million increase in wage costs. Deloitte believes that trend cannot continue, but predicts the Premier League's new broadcast contracts will drive revenue up to over $3 billion in 2010-11. Fans keep football afloat . So, why does football seem to be immune to the financial pressures being felt by many industries across the globe? \"Football has got an incredible amount of customer loyalty, which helps. A lot of clubs have been fairly good at freezing or cutting their prices,\" Jones said. \"It is a fairly accepted truth that live sports audiences are about as good as it gets for broadcasters. People will get together to watch it, it inspires those water-cooler moments. \"If you want live sports as a broadcaster then you're going to want the biggest sport in the world, and if you want the biggest league in the world then you want the Premier League.\" 'Spectacular mismanagement' As for Portsmouth, who became the first club in Premier League history to sink into administration this season and were subsequently relegated, Jones thinks their situation was an anomaly. \"We see clubs get into difficulty because performance on the pitch is poor, with relegation and the like, but with Portsmouth actually performing well and winning an FA Cup, for them to be in this situation it has to be a fairly spectacular case of mismanagement.\" Deloitte also warned that Premier League clubs would have make the necessary adjustments to their business plans to meet European governing body UEFA's target of becoming \"break even\" by 2013-14.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Nanci Griffith wanted to look on the bright side. Nanci Griffith, who says she's \"fed up with negativity,\" was revitalized by the election of Barack Obama. And who could blame her? In the past decade, Griffith -- perhaps best known for her Grammy-winning 1993 album, \"Other Voices, Other Rooms\" -- had faced a political climate she didn't agree with, as well as recovery from thyroid and breast cancer, which she was diagnosed with in the late '90s. Songwriting had become a struggle for the singer with the gentle, crystalline voice. \"It was ... horrific,\" she said simply. However, with her latest album, \"The Loving Kind\" (Rounder), Griffith is as focused and passionate as she has been in years. Sparked by the changes in her life and American politics, she said, music has been vital to her personal resurgence. \"It was nice to focus on things outside of my body. Music has always done that for me,\" she said. Describing herself as someone who was \"fed up with negativity,\" Griffith was equally inspired by her fellow countrymen. \"[The] American people will not let this country collapse,\" she said. The idea motivated her to look at her country's dark path of injustice not so long ago, stories that worked their way into her songwriting. \"In some ways, I'm just a journalist. I [want] my audience to hear these stories,\" she said. CNN spoke with Griffith from her home in Nashville, Tennessee. CNN: Being a folk singer and your views being what they are, was it tougher or maybe easier to write songs from 2000 to 2008? Nanci Griffith: It was very difficult for me. I was hurt by the direction my country was going in. And then, after [the 2008 election], everything came spilling out. Things came along like the Mildred and Richard Loving case (\"The Loving Kind\"), where Mildred died, and I read her obituary. [The Lovings were a couple whose interracial marriage was against the law in Virginia at the time.] That was such an inspiration. ... Just wondering why I never knew about this and how important that case is currently with equality in marriage. Little things. Bit by bit, my heart started to open up again, and I could write! CNN: Had you ever gone through that before? Griffith: No, never in my life. I've always been a very prolific writer. CNN: Now, what about writing in the age of Obama? Griffith: (laughs) It feels great! People may be down on their luck, financially. But I see so much optimism about the direction of the country and [general] openness. CNN: Now, in addition to \"The Loving Kind,\" there are other songs based on actual events on this record. Tell me about \"Not Innocent Enough.\" Griffith: That's based on Philip Workman's case in Memphis [Tennessee]. He was robbing a Wendy's -- was a heroin addict -- and police came in, and an officer was killed. Now, Workman didn't kill him; it was friendly fire. Workman was convicted anyway and executed. I'm a total abolitionist when it comes to the death penalty, but this case really stunned me, because I feel like this country has evolved enough to where we shouldn't have to live with the death penalty. CNN: Is it hard as a writer/musician to inhabit those songs, knowing that they are actual events? Griffith: Not really. I feel like, in some ways, I'm just a journalist. I don't express my opinion [in the songs], necessarily. But it's important to me that my audience hear these stories. I want as many people to know about Loving v. Virginia as possible. CNN: Do you feel like it's a more palatable way to become aware of a story like that when a song is attached to it? Griffith: I do. I've been informed many times through music. Pete Seeger, Odetta, Dave Van Ronk, Bruce Springsteen ... so many folk songwriters. It's all around you. CNN: The song \"Still Life\" -- I suspect that's about President George W. Bush? Griffith: It's about people like him. This country is full of them, and especially my home state of Texas. It's a [perspective on] people who go through life getting away with everything. CNN: Do you feel a sense of vindication with President Obama's election, or at least a sense that things are moving in a direction you're in favor of? Griffith: I hope so. Right now, he is my hero. So is his wife. CNN: What in your past steered you into a topical songwriter? Griffith: I was always more interested in story songs, things with a point of view ... and things that informed me. CNN: Is there a different process of writing those topical songs versus a song like \"Up Against the Rain,\" which is clearly more personal? Griffith: There is a burden to writing [those topical songs]: You better have your facts straight. When you're writing a personal song like \"Rain,\" it's straight from your heart and seems to just flow. CNN: \"Sing\" seems like it would fit that description. Does that song sum up your life in a way? Griffith: Many have asked that, but I was actually inspired to write that by watching an interview with Shania Twain where she said it would not have mattered if she remained a lounge act for her whole career. It's not something you choose. It's just what you do.",

    "input": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Fighting that raged for hours in Kabul Tuesday afternoon after a dramatic Taliban attack on the U.S. Embassy and NATO's command calmed down greatly during the evening hours, a military spokesman told CNN . But the strike in central Kabul and two other brazen assaults across the city left residents unnerved, and security forces braced for more. Gunfire continued to ring out. Three police officers have died and others have been injured in the violence across Kabul, police said. The Afghan Public Health ministry said one civilian was killed and at least 18 were wounded, but none seriously. The central Kabul strike occurred amid intelligence that insurgents might launch a high-profile attack in the capital around the 10th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the United States, a coalition officer and a senior official of NATO's International Security Assistance Force confirmed to CNN. The strike directed at the ISAF headquarters and the embassy was the most dramatic. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told CNN that his group targeted \"the U.S. Embassy, governmental organizations and other foreign organizations.\" Militants stormed a building under construction and set up positions there to launch the attack, U.S., ISAF and Afghan officials said. ISAF said the insurgents attacked the \"vicinity\" of the embassy and the ISAF headquarters using small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. An ISAF official said there were initial reports that some rounds hit the NATO base and caused minor damage. Brig. Gen. Carsten Jacobson, spokesman for ISAF, said a small number of \"terrorists\" used high-elevated positions around the area to strike with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms. He said the group failed to inflict ISAF and U.S. casualties but he noted the strike was \"carefully planned.\" A senior ISAF official said the attacks were launched from an area outside the secure zone surrounding both areas. ISAF said Afghan National Security Forces and coalition forces immediately were sent to the scene. Coalition forces were providing air support. The Afghan Interior Ministry said four suicide attackers entered the building site from which the attack was being carried out. Three of them have been killed, it said. CIA Director David Petraeus, testifying at a congressional hearing in Washington Tuesday, said Afghan forces were clearing the building. The building is next to Abdul Haq Square, a few blocks from the U.S. Embassy, an intelligence officer told CNN. An embassy spokeswoman said staff at the U.S. facility had been told to take cover. \"The U.S. Embassy can confirm an attack has occurred in the area of the U.S. Embassy\" by people armed with rocket-propelled grenades and small arms, spokeswoman Kerri Hannan said. She said four Afghans -- three visa applicants and a local contract guard -- were hurt in the attack on the embassy compound, but none had life-threatening injuries. \"Our thoughts are with these individuals and the other victims of the terrorist attacks that happened today in Kabul. We appreciate the response of the Afghan National Security Forces whose operations stopped the attack on the embassy compound,\" Hannan said. A U.S. Embassy worker, who asked not to be named for security reasons, called the assault \"well-coordinated\" and said there was incoming fire around every corner of the building. After a few hours of loud and intense fire, he said, the situation appeared to calm down. He said the people at the embassy were well-protected by the guards there. ISAF's Jacobson also said the situation calmed down by early evening. Pentagon spokesman George Little said the attacks were \"less than spectacular\" and despite their high-profile nature \"one of the things we're seeing this fighting season is a less effective insurgency.\" U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said there were no reports of U.S. casualties and the country \"will take all necessary steps\" to secure the area and keep personnel safe. She said the \"dedicated, brave men and women\" from the United States who work for the Afghan people \"will not be intimidated\" by this cowardly act. Central Kabul is considered a high-security area, and it is protected by police and other security forces. ISAF said that it doesn't appear insurgents breached the sector around the sites. ISAF personnel currently were told to stay indoors and take cover but there are no casualties, the official said. Gen. John Allen, ISAF commander, remains on the compound, ISAF said. The Afghan National Directorate of Security and the Interior Ministry spokesman said the insurgents were using rocket-propelled grenades and light weapons. A hospital official said two injured civilians were being treated and the hospital expected to handle more casualties. The area was cordoned off, according to Gen. Mohammed Zahir, the head of criminal investigation for the Afghan police. The coalition and ISAF officials pointed out that while this attack is considered to be high-profile because of the U.S. Embassy and ISAF targets, it so far is not considered a \"spectacular\" attack because of the small number of gunmen and limited weapons involved. Other violence also was reported. In a Twitter message, ISAF said a \"suicide attacker was identified & killed by ANP before reaching target near Kabul airport,\" making reference to the Afghan National Police. There were no further details. The Taliban said a suicide attack targeted a police compound in the western part of the city, but the Interior Ministry said the attacker -- clad in an explosives vest -- was shot before he entered the compound. Another attacker set off a bomb in front of a high school, the ministry said. Casualties were reported in both incidents. The U.S. Embassy issued an emergency message about the series of attacks across Kabul Tuesday, saying \"the situation is uncertain and ongoing. There are media reports that many roads are closed in Kabul.\" It said appointments for visas or U.S. citizen services have been canceled for now and it said Americans in Afghanistan should monitor the websites of the embassy and the State Department's Bureau of Consular Affairs for the latest information. \"We urge U.S. citizens to shelter in place, avoid unnecessary movement, and to avoid the neighborhood around the U.S. Embassy: Wazir Akbar Khan, Microrayon, and Massoud Circle,\" it said. \"The Embassy also urges U.S. citizens to remain vigilant and avoid areas where Westerners congregate. Do not discuss travel plans or other personal matters with strangers, or in public. Be alert and aware of your surroundings, and always travel with mobile phones or appropriate communication equipment.\" The attacks by the Taliban continue what has been a violent period. Over the weekend, two Afghan laborers were killed while 77 U.S. troops and 25 Afghan workers were wounded in a Taliban truck bombing on an ISAF base in Afghanistan's Wardak province. Last month, Taliban suicide bombers killed at least eight people in Kabul when they attacked the British Council, a British-government-affiliated body that fosters cultural and academic exchanges. The Taliban harbored the al Qaeda network that launched the 9/11 strike. A U.S.-led coalition toppled the Taliban and has been fighting militants in Afghanistan for nearly 10 years. NATO is drawing down and handing over security control to national forces. Some 10,000 U.S. troops are scheduled to depart by year's end, with all U.S. military personnel out of Afghanistan by the end of 2014. Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Vygaudas Usackas, head of the European Union mission in Afghanistan, were among those who condemned the attacks. NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the Taliban attacks in Kabul Tuesday were an attempt to derail plans to hand over security responsibility to Afghan forces in Afghanistan. \"We are witnessing that the Taliban try to test (the) transition but they can't stop it. Transition is on track and it will continue,\" Rasmussen said. CNN's Joe Sterling in Atlanta, Barbara Starr, Adam Levine and Elise Labott in Washington and Tim Schwarz, Matiullah Mati, Ruhullah Khaplakwak and Suzanne Malveaux in Kabul contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- These past six weeks, we've been thinking a lot about the ocean. But there's a deeper story than this one oil spill. Unfortunately the Deepwater Horizon disaster is a pretty typical example of the way we think about the ocean: We just don't worry about stuff that happens out there. The ocean covers 71 percent of the Earth's surface, and we hardly know anything about it. We humans are creating big problems because of what we don't know. We take fish from the ocean to eat without really knowing where they came from, or what they eat, or how many of them there are, or if we're maybe taking the last one. We dump whatever we like in the ocean and watch it float away -- to where? Who cares? The ocean is a massive, unexplored area of our planet, and in the U.S., we spend less on getting to know it than we spend on getting to know outer space. And our lack of attention is showing. Ocean fish are shrinking in size from year to year; coral reefs are being scraped away, and glorious ocean habitats are dying. But because it happens in the blank blue part of the globe, we don't hear about it or if we do, we don't pay attention. Watch the story of a woman who rowed the Pacific . So how can we get your attention on the ocean -- so we can start solving these problems we're creating? In April, we went on a trip to the GalÃ¡pagos with 100 ocean scientists, activists and artists, filmmakers and musicians, to talk about what's going on in the ocean and what we can do to help. On the Mission Blue Voyage, we heard things and saw things that shocked us -- like Brian Skerry's picture of shrimp bycatch, the 8 pounds of dead sea creatures that are thrown away as garbage in order to catch 10 ounces of shrimp. Watch Skerry's talk about the glory and shame of the oceans . And we saw Jeremy Jackson describe a nearly lifeless ocean taken over by jellyfish. We also saw amazing things, thing that blew our minds -- like watching a bioluminescent jellyfish light up its mating display in the pitch-black deep ocean. We talked with some of the smartest people we've ever met, and we came up with some big plans for saving the ocean. But we came home from the trip still wondering -- will it make a difference? We're not scientists, but we know something we can do: encourage you to talk and think about the ocean, with hope that you will be more involved in the things that will make a difference. It's hard to think about having a role in saving something so overwhelmingly immense. But you can be a part of making things better. In fact, all of us have to. Here are some great places to start: . â¢ Write a letter to your elected representative. Handwrite it; it makes a difference if you do. Let them know you support increased funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The more we learn about the ocean, the better we can protect it. If you live in Hawaii, thank your legislator for being part of the ban on sharkfin soup; if you live outside Hawaii, ask your state or county representatives why it hasn't been banned yet where you live. â¢ If you're on Facebook, join the Mission Blue page or if you're on Twitter, follow @MissionBlue to keep up with ocean news. â¢ Get one of those little responsible seafood guides, and use it. If you eat fish, tell your fish guy that sustainable fish is important to you, and not to sell you any more shrimp from overseas. And don't eat any more bluefin tuna or sharkfin soup. Did you know we killed 10 million sharks last year just for their fins? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Chevy and Jayni Chase.",

Mortgage Meltdown when it airs commercial-free on Monday, October 6, 2008, from approximately 4:10-- 5:00 a.m. ET on CNN. (A short feature begins at 4:00 a.m. and precedes the program.) Program Overview . Home loans gone bad are wrecking the U.S. economy. CNN teams up with Fortune Magazine's Andy Serwer to investigate how the housing boom went bust. The fallout begins on Wall Street, where billions of dollars in American mortgages were bought, bundled and sold around the world. CNN takes the high-stakes mortgage game to Delmonico's, a Wall Street institution since 1837, where the likes of J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie once wheeled and dealed. Host Andy Serwer plays dealer and invites a few experts to face off on the mortgage crisis. Guest players include New York Times columnist and Princeton economist Paul Krugman, CNN's Personal Finance Editor Gerri Willis, securities guru Janet Tavakoli, investment strategist Peter Dunay and mortgage broker Jon Shibley. Grade Levels: 11-12, College . Subject Areas: Business, Economics, Finance, Social Studies, Life Skills . Objectives: . The CNN Special Investigations Unit Classroom Edition: Busted! Mortgage Meltdown and its corresponding discussion questions and activity challenge students to: . Curriculum Connections . Economics America National Standards . Standard 10 : Role of Economic Institutions . Students will understand that: Institutions evolve in market economies to help individuals and groups accomplish their goals. Banks, labor unions, corporations, legal systems, and not-for-profit organizations are examples of important institutions. A different kind of institution, clearly defined and enforced property rights, is essential to a market economy. Standard 16 : Role of Government . Students will understand that: There is an economic role for government in a market economy whenever the benefits of a government policy outweigh its costs. Governments often provide for national defense, address environmental concerns, define and protect property rights, and attempt to make markets more competitive. Most government policies also redistribute income. The Economics America National Standards (http://www.ncee.net/ea/standards/) are published by the National Council on Economic Education (http://www.ncee.net/). Social Studies . Standard V. Individuals, Groups and Institutions: Social studies programs should include experiences that provide for the study of interactions among individuals, groups, and institutions. Standard VI.

Suggested Activity . Point out to students that one of the best ways for them to prepare for homeownership is to arm themselves with knowledge, and that the purpose of this activity is to help them obtain this information. Group students and instruct each group to prepare a PowerPoint presentation on the top ten things that first-time homebuyers should know before they shop for a mortgage. Groups may want to include information that addresses these points: . Have groups deliver their presentations to the class. If possible, invite a realtor or mortgage broker to attend the presentations and discuss the guidelines that are used to determine whether or not a homebuyer can afford a home. Extension . Following the presentations, direct students to print and online resources to identify homes that are for sale in their community, as well as the current interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage, a 15-year fixed mortgage and a 5/1 ARM. Next, have each student select a house and use an online amortization schedule calculator to determine what the monthly payment (principle + interest) would be for each type of loan, assuming that the loan was for 80% of the purchase price of the home.

    "input": "New York (CNN)  -- TV's \"Top Chef\" is now the top chef in the U.S., and he wants you to eat at his restaurant -- no silver spoon required. Tom Colicchio won the Outstanding Chef Award at Monday night's James Beard Awards at Avery Fisher Hall in New York. While he's glad of the nod, he's well aware that many people think it means his restaurants are now out of their league. Colicchio is the owner of Craft, Craftsteak, the 'Wichcraft sandwich chain, and the recently opened Colicchio & Sons, and host of the \"Top Chef\" program on Bravo. See list of James Beard award winners . He and Beard's Best Service Award winner, Grant Achatz of Chicago's Alinea, agree that while fine dining may be pricey -- it's often roughly the cost of concert or sports tickets -- it's also a chance to have the experience of a lifetime. And it's their business to make diners feel welcome. \"Most of the better restaurants out there -- even if they're high-end -- are usually not snobby and pretentious. It's the restaurants that are trying to be like that that get it wrong! The root of dining and hospitality is taking care of people,\" Colicchio told CNN. \"People go to high-end restaurants and expect it to be snobby. They get their hackles up. They see a waiter talking to another waiter, sharing a joke, and think they're being laughed at. Come on. That's not the case.\" \"In New York, [waiters are] writers, dancers and painters. They don't have money to go to fine-dining fancy restaurants! They're not from some highfalutin' background and going to look down at you. They're working-class people -- like everyone in restaurants.\" And while you'll never leave his restaurants hungry, don't go expecting to have to loosen your belt too much. But do \"expect to be really taken care of. When food costs more, the restaurant can afford to have more staff on the floor.\" \"Things you need to keep in mind going to an upscale restaurant are that the price you're paying is not for a lot of food. It's for high-quality food. It's a very different dining experience than if you're going to a chain restaurant where they're piling it on.\" \"I was reading a book called 'The Zen Guitarist,' which essentially said that too much food on a plate is wasteful and unappetizing and it's the role of the chef to deliver the right portion of food.\" Colicchio adds, \"Do a tiny bit of research. Go online and see what they have to offer. If you're intimidated by the menu, that's when you really need to use the waiter.\" His most important bit of advice for diners: \"Be nice. It goes a long way. You don't need to palm a maitre d' with a tip at the door to get a good table. If you walk up and say, 'This is a special occasion -- my wife and I are having our first anniversary,' they'll take care of you.\" At Chicago's Alinea -- which was ranked in 7th place on a recently released list of the world's top 50 restaurants -- diners will never have to wonder if they're using the right salad fork -- or any fork at all. Chef Grant Achatz is known for serving highly inventive dishes involving elements like scented air, temperature contrasts and custom-made utensils that sometimes require eating instructions from the wait staff, and he's well aware that many diners are outside of their comfort zone. \"Because of the nature of the cuisine -- it being challenging because of the manipulations of ingredients and the way it's presented -- we have to counteract that with very approachable service,\" he told CNN. \"Unlike a lot of four-star restaurants in the past that [have] scripts for describing the dishes and everyone has to cut their hair the same -- all the connotations of the snooty French waiter -- we intentionally abandoned. We encourage our staff to let their personality shine through, because that's real hospitality. It's about making people feel comfortable and welcome.\" Achatz is aware that he's likely to encounter skeptics with his unusual approach to dining, but he and his staff are up to the challenge. \"Some people walk through the door, ready to let us take them on a journey. With some people, it takes a course or two to build up that trust -- through the food or the service team letting them know it's OK to laugh out loud. It's OK to giggle and smile,\" he said. And diners do. Blogs and websites abound with stories of patrons weeping, moaning and screaming with surprise and delight most nights of the week. His advice to diners: Come with an open mind. And he'll do his part to help. Said Achatz, \"When we opened nearly five years ago, there was so much hype and buzz and people saying they were worried they weren't going to 'get it.' We decided to combat that.\" \"The very first bite that everyone had was, literally, peanut butter and jelly. We're going to give you something everyone had at some point in their life. It doesn't look anything like a peanut butter and jelly, but it will taste like one. That's going to set the tone, and people are going to laugh, and everything is OK after that. In a way we were making fun of ourselves.\" And if the chef and staff can have a ball, so can the customers. Said Achatz, \"Relax. You're here to have a good time.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- President Barack Obama must do well in the debate Monday or he risks losing the national security advantage that Democrats have struggled so hard to regain. Obama was able to ward off Mitt Romney's attacks about Libya in the second debate, when Romney tripped up on one word, \"terror,\" which contradicted the public record. But tonight, the Republican will have 90 minutes to take on the president's national security program in more systematic fashion. With last week's capture of a terrorist who was planning to bomb the New York Federal Reserve and a brutal bombing of civilians in Syria, national security issues are heating up. Democrats stand a lot to lose. For several decades, the public trusted Republicans on the issue of national security. Since Vietnam, Republicans hammered away at Democrats as being weak on defense and unwilling to do what was necessary to protect the nation. In 2004, President George W. Bush eviscerated his opponent, Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, with this argument. Though Kerry began the Democratic Convention by highlighting his credentials as a Vietnam veteran, the Republicans developed an entire campaign around the question of whether Democrats could be trusted to prosecute the war on terrorism. For all of Obama's struggles with the economy, Democrats have made huge strides in the past six years. The reversal of partisan fortunes began toward the end of George W. Bush's presidency, when the White House was struggling to avoid total chaos in Iraq, a war that was highly unpopular. Democrats took control of Congress in the 2006 elections, partially in response to Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq and his handling of it. In the 2008 presidential election, Obama made Bush's war a centerpiece of his campaign. He promised to bring the war to an end and to reverse those components of the war on terrorism that had violated civil liberties. The strategy was successful. As president, Obama continued to neutralize many of his critics. He left intact most of Bush's counterterrorism program, in some cases intensifying operations such as drone airstrikes against al Qaeda, and he made it difficult for conservatives to say that he was not doing enough. After Osama bin Laden was killed by special operations forces, even Republicans had to praise the courageous operation. Obama accelerated the war in Afghanistan and brought the controversial war in Iraq to a close. While many on the left have been frustrated that Obama retained so much of the status quo, politically the president positioned himself as the person who was tougher on defense. During the Democratic Convention, he railed against Romney for having failed to salute the troops in his acceptance speech and for a series of embarrassing gaffes that took place when Romney traveled overseas this summer. In September, Pew found that 53% of those surveyed trusted Obama to make wise decisions on foreign policy, compared with 38% for Romney. But in recent weeks, the advantage seems to be eroding. The outbreak of violence in the Middle East and the White House's contradictory statements about a deadly al Qaeda attack at the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, have opened up space for Republicans to go after the administration on this front. Vice President Joe Biden's statements during his debate against Paul Ryan that neither he nor the president knew about security threats, along with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton taking responsibility, certainly did not help. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, told Fox News, \"I think it's very laudable that she should throw herself under the bus. But first of all, responsibility for American security doesn't lie with the secretary of state. It lies with the president of the United States. It's either willful deception or a degree of incompetence and failure to understand fundamental facts on the ground. ... Either one of those is obviously totally unacceptable.\" Obama has tried to push back against all of this criticism, including his statement in the second debate that he himself has ultimate responsibility, but the Republicans' singular attacks have continued nonetheless. Administration officials must be careful if they think there is no risk. Aside from 2008, there are many years in which parties lost their advantage on national security. In 1952, Democrats still thought of themselves as the party that had won World War II and set up America's Cold War strategy against the Soviet Union. Republicans hit back when Adlai Stevenson faced off against Dwight Eisenhower, a World War II military hero. Republicans attacked Democrats for being weak on fighting communism, for a military stalemate in Korea and for having allowed China to fall to communism in 1949. Eisenhower won the presidency, and Republicans took control of Congress. Just a few years later, Republicans saw their advantage slip away. Though Eisenhower was an immensely popular president and one who, as Evan Thomas shows in his masterful new book \"Ike's Bluff,\" demonstrated immense skills at diplomacy, John F. Kennedy ran as more of a hawk than Eisenhower's vice president, Richard Nixon, did in 1960. He built on arguments that Democrats had made in the 1950s, that Republicans were so focused on balancing the budget they were not spending enough on defense to win the presidency. \"Our security,\" he said, \"has declined more rapidly than over any comparable period in our history -- in terms of defensive strength and retaliatory power, in terms of our alliances, in terms of our scientific effort and reputation.\" Republicans struggled again in 1992 when President George H.W. Bush watched as his advantage, which had apparently been cemented with the successful Operation Desert Storm in 1990-1991 that resulted in the expulsion of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, slip away. While Bush did not devote enough attention to the economy, it was also Saddam Hussein's continued military attacks on his opponents in U.N. cease-fire zones that seemed to demonstrate Bush's victory had been incomplete. \"It's like any other bully,\" presidential candidate Bill Clinton said then, \"you send 'em mixed messages, they'll take advantage of you every time.\" The politics of national security is tricky, and uncontrollable events can easily push politics in a different direction. Obama will have to answer some of the tough questions that have emerged, and this time Romney is going to be prepared to handle them more effectively and to show that his overall agenda still offers the U.S. the best path forward. Monday's debate can have a big impact, not just on the outcome in November, but on how the public thinks about whom they should trust when it comes to national security. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- A former high school teacher in Virginia was charged Wednesday with transporting and possessing child pornography, a discovery that was made after he was accused of engaging in sexual acts with a 16-year-old male former student, according to court documents. Kevin Garfield Ricks, 50, was arrested in February at Osbourn High School in Manassas, Virginia, after authorities were notified of the alleged sexual misconduct, according to the criminal complaint filed against him Wednesday in U.S. District Court. Another student apparently reported the alleged offense to police after seeing a Facebook message from Ricks posted on the 16-year-old's Facebook page that read, \"You told me our experience was your first with a guy,\" according to the complaint. The 16-year-old student told police that Ricks committed \"several sexual acts\" on him in December after providing him with \"significant quantities of Tequila.\" Authorities investigating the allegations seized Ricks' personal belongings, including the personal laptop that he carried from his Virginia home during the week to his home in Maryland on the weekends. The laptop revealed eight images of child pornography, according to the complaint. The computer also contained an online chat transcript between Ricks and another alleged victim, who accused him of molestation in the mid-'70s at a summer camp for children with disabilities where Ricks worked as a counselor. Other pornographic images were found at Ricks' home in Federalsburg, Maryland, including some that appear to have been taken in Japan in the late '80s and early '90s, when Ricks worked as an English teacher there. Most of the boys depicted in the images appear to be incapacitated, according to the complaint. An additional search of Ricks' Maryland home in April turned up \"hundreds\" of videotapes and still images of child pornography, as well as handwritten journals that \"describe sexual acts with a number of conscious and unconscious minor males at a variety of locations,\" the complaint says. After his arrest in February, Ricks told detectives that the teachers union had told him that he had been \"walking a thin line\" after a parent accused him of \"stalking\" a student he was mentoring at the Huntington Learning Center in Fauqier County, Virginia. In a written statement provided by his attorney to The Washington Post last week, Ricks said he \"will spend the rest of my days seeking forgiveness and atonement.\" \"It is understandable how some may see me in a negative light, but like other people in this world, I have had many positive accomplishments in my personal life and career. I would like people to consider those as well,\" the statement said, according to the Post. Ricks is being held in the Prince William County Adult Detention Center. If convicted of the charges, he faces up to 30 years in prison.",

    "input": "New York (CNN) -- The last thing 18-year-old Mohamed Kamara from Sierra Leone expected was to be honored by the New York Yankees, but there he was, tossing out the first pitch at a Yankees-Detroit Tigers game last week. Kamara survived one of Africa's most brutal civil wars, nearly losing his life in his homeland. The Yankees celebrated Kamara's survival and community spirit here, where he has lived since coming from Sierra Leone, with the team's annual Project HOPE program. HOPE (Helping Others Persevere & Excel) recognizes people who have overcome their own personal challenges and who now inspire others by changing the community they live in. \"Today is going to be your day, where you're going to hang out with us on this Hope Week and we're going to make this day about you, because you make every day about everybody else,\" said Brian Chashman, general manager of the Yankees, as Kamara was being honored. Hanging out was an understatement, even by Yankee standards. Kamara got the shock of life when he walked into a room at the New York Stock Exchange and was greeted by Yankee brass and players, including star lefthander C.C. Sabathia along with Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson. He toured the trading floor and was awarded an internship for next year by the stock exchange. He didn't know it then, but his surprise itinerary would next include a chat with Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a visit to the United Nations to meet the ambassador from Sierre Leone and to stand on the rostrum of the General Assembly, plus that trip to Yankee Stadium to throw out the first pitch at the Yankee-Tigers contest Wednesday night. Kamara earned his special honors. He was forced to become the sole provider for his family at the age of 9. With his mother suddenly ill and an absentee father, Kamara took care of his four younger siblings. When a shaky ceasefire began in Sierre Leone,  Mohamed came to the U.S. a few years ago to live with an aunt and uncle in the Bronx and to pursue his hope that he could create a better life for himself and his family. He attended high school, starting without any English skills, and ended up graduating in the top quarter of his class. A high school mentor helped him get a job as a golf caddy, and he commutes by train for almost five hours a day to and from New Jersey for that job. Seventy percent of what he earns is sent back to his family. \"(I) get up every day at four o'clock in the morning to go to work. It was hard for me, but you know, I was determined to do it because I have a family to take care of and that was my main focus,\" Kamara said. He went on to earn a partial scholarship to Johnson & Wales University in Rhode Island, where he plans to major in business. Kamara recognizes the problems created by Wall Street but is not deterred; rather, he believes he has a role to play in its recovery. \"You know, it takes someone to fix it up, so hopefully one day I will be that person,\" Kamara said. Derek Jeter, captain of the Yankees, who met Kamara at the U.N., described him as \"a remarkable young man. He's come over to this country, goes to school, works to support his family, now he's headed off to college. We couldn't be more proud of him.\" After his U.N. tour, Kamara said he hoped one day to return to Sierre Leone to help improve things there. \"We're  inspired by the younger generations, moving like this, and trying to rebrandish the country of Sierra Leone,\" said Ambassador Shekou Touray.. Kamara's friends also are inspired by the selflessness of his actions -- so inspired, they compare him to a president they greatly respect. \"One time he was standing for class president and people came out with, 'Mobama, Mobama!' We used to call him that,\" said Owusu Mensah, Kamara's closest friend.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- When 48-year-old Erin Peiffer, of Eldersburg, Maryland, learned that she had high cholesterol in her 20s, she never thought it would pose a problem. When she was 39, Erin Peiffer, now 48, had open-heart surgery to unblock her left main artery. Although her overall cholesterol number lingered in the low to mid-200s, she figured her medication would keep it under control. But she figured wrong, and heart disease slowly started clogging her arteries. Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, says that over the years, it's become clear to most American women that heart disease is nothing to ignore. It's the leading cause of death of women in the United States, says Nabel, a prominent advocate for women's heart health. But Nabel says many women still don't know all the risk factors for heart disease, especially when it comes to cholesterol. \"For middle-aged women, 40 to 60, high cholesterol is the single most important risk factor for heart disease and heart attacks,\" she said. The Heart Truth: How to lower your risk for heart disease . Peiffer didn't think much about her cholesterol until nine years ago, when, at age 39, she began to feel ill during a water aerobics class. \"I started coughing,\" she recalled. \"I was coughing a lot!\" It got so bad she decided to drive home. The cough, she says, grew worse. \"The coughing continued, but then I was coughing up this pink, frothy stuff, and I knew that wasn't right.\" Alarmed, Peiffer left her kids with her husband and drove herself to the hospital. But because of her age, doctors never considered that she might be having heart problems; they figured she had a virus and sent her home. But later tests showed that she had something wrong with her heart. After performing an angiogram, her doctors told her the bad news.  Watch more on women and high cholesterol Â» . \"They told me I had a 99 percent blockage in my left main artery,\" she said. \"I needed open-heart surgery.\" Millions of Americans get a diagnosis of high cholesterol every year. Cholesterol comes from two sources: your body and your food. Your liver (and to a smaller degree, your cells) makes about 75 percent of blood cholesterol. The remaining 25 percent comes from the foods you eat. Cholesterol is divided into two main types. HDL, or high-density lipoprotein, is the \"good\" cholesterol because it helps to clear excess fats from the arteries. LDL, or low-density lipoprotein, is the bad cholesterol because it clogs the arteries, increasing a person's risk for heart attack and stroke. The American Heart Association says that in premenopausal women, estrogen tends to raise HDL (good) cholesterol. But as estrogen drops during menopause, HDL levels drop too, and LDL levels rise. That's why women need to know their numbers. For years, physicians believed that hormone-replacement therapy was a good way to protect a woman's heart. However, the heart association recommends that hormone replacement not be used for cardiovascular protection, because recent studies have shown that postmenopausal women using it received no real heart benefit. In some people, improving diet and adding exercise can lower the overall number, but when lifestyle changes don't work and for people who have a genetic predisposition for high cholesterol, medication is usually prescribed. But cardiologists say many people think that because they are taking medication, they're protected and don't need to worry about their numbers. That's just not the case. So what are good cholesterol levels? Your overall cholesterol number should be under 200. If you have other risk factors -- like smoking, high blood pressure or a family history of heart disease -- your doctor may want it lower. A good HDL level of 60 mg or greater is considered protective. LDL should be under 100 mg for those with no risk factors for heart disease and 70 mg for those at higher risk. But again, depending on your health and family history, your doctor may want different readings. The first step in fighting high cholesterol is simple: \"Get a blood test,\" Nabel said. The National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines recommend that everyone age 20 and older get a fasting \"lipoprotein profile\" every five years. It gives your doctor information about total cholesterol, LDL, HDL and triglycerides, which are the main type of fat in blood. If your numbers are unhealthy, your doctor can advise you on treatment. If you want to avoid medication and try to achieve healthy cholesterol numbers naturally, the American Heart Association has these recommendations: . â¢ Keep your weight down, and cut down on calories, especially from saturated and trans fats, carbohydrates and alcohol. Even small amounts of alcohol can lead to large changes in triglyceride levels (although red wine may slightly bump up good cholesterol). â¢ Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables and nonfat or low-fat dairy products. And add fish to your diet. Fish oil helps reduce cholesterol. â¢ Get off the couch and get active. Even 30 minutes of moderate exercise, five days a week or more, can make a difference. After her surgery, Peiffer had her family members' cholesterol levels checked. She found that two of her three children had high numbers, and they are now on medication. Today, Peiffer too takes her medication, eats right and exercises to keep her heart healthy. And most important, she knows her numbers: Her cholesterol is well below 200. She said, \"I tell anyone, anyone who will listen -- my family, friends -- 'Know your cholesterol numbers.' It could save your life.\"",

    "input": "(Financial Times) -- When pop sensation Girls' Generation recently provided the grand finale to the Late Show with David Letterman, a top slot on US television, it signalled that South Korea's entertainment industry had broken out of Asia and is now looking to make it big in the west. Just days after making their first appearance on US network television with their hit single \"The Boys\", the band of nine telegenic women this week returned to France -- where tickets for a 2011 concert sold out in 15 minutes -- to sing on prime time television. Korean films, soap operas and \"K-Pop\" music idols, many of which were modelled on Japan's own sugary \"J-Pop\", have taken Asia by storm over the past decade. But the hallyu -- or \"Korean wave\" as the phenomenon is known in Asia -- is now spreading to Europe and the US, and spurring South Korea's export earnings. Cultural exports -- including films, comics and computer games -- hit a record $4.2bn last year, up from $2.6bn in 2009, causing the share prices of leading entertainment studios to soar. Even Korea's favourite cartoon character, the penguin Pororo, has appeared on television in 120 countries. Cho Hyun-jin, a government representative who coined the phrase K-Pop for Korean bands in a previous incarnation as a journalist, said the spread of Korean music had surpassed his highest hopes. \"It was my old heroes like Led Zeppelin who famously played Madison Square Garden. Now to see Girls' Generation there is amazing,\" he said. While Korea has been an export powerhouse for decades in electronics, ships and cars, manufacturing companies have rarely played up their Korean brand identity, fearing until recently they would be seen as inferior in quality to Japanese rivals. Cultural exports are, however, giving the once reclusive country a global cachet for the first time, shaking off the war-torn images of the US comedy M*A*S*H. Broadcasting exports such as television dramas hit $252m last year, up from $185m in 2009, according to government statistics. Music earned $177m, soaring from only $31m in 2009. Film exports earned $26m, up from $14m in 2009. Until recently, hallyu was seen as an Asian phenomenon. A 2003 drama called \"Jewel in the Palace\" about a female doctor at a 16th-century royal court proved a huge hit from Taiwan to Iran, and has more recently come to eastern Europe. Asia is still crucial and the most effective managers continue to target export markets there. Park Jin-young, the impresario who runs JYP Entertainment, created the band Miss A with two Korean and two Chinese singers, so they can record their hits in both Korean and Mandarin. Girls' Generation sing in Korean, English and Japanese. \"The next phase is for the music industry to introduce western singers to globalise the boy and girl bands further,\" said Han Koo-hyun, president of the Korean Wave Research Institute. Koreans have been surprised by the enthusiasm for K-Pop in the west, where Korean culture receives scant attention in mainstream media. Korean newspapers splash photographs of packed French concert halls or British fans greeting Girls' Generation with signs in Korean. These European fans have largely discovered K-Pop through social networking sites, Facebook and YouTube. Many commentators have also observed that K-Pop's novelty to outsiders comes from the years of training -- sometimes in tough quasi-boot camps -- that stars endure to ensure their songs are accompanied by immaculate group choreography that is rare in other pop music. While cultural exports are a source of national pride, Koreans are also calling for improved regulation of the industry. The suicide of Jang Ja-yeon, a soap starlet, in 2009, focused attention on hallyu's dark underworld where some performers are locked into slave contracts and are told to sleep with managers to win roles.

Kwame Kilpatrick appears for his sentencing October 28, 2008, in Detroit, Michigan. Kilpatrick, his beard overgrown and bushy, was escorted out of Michigan's Wayne County jail as he dodged a crowd of reporters before getting into a car and was driven away, according to television footage from CNN affiliate WXYZ. Kilpatrick spent 100 days in jail as part of a plea agreement connected to a sex scandal that rocked Detroit and caused the city council and governor of Michigan to push to impeach him. Kilpatrick also agreed not to run for public office during his five years of probation. He was expected to immediately leave the state for a job interview, WXYZ reported. Kilpatrick pleaded guilty in September to two felony counts of obstruction of justice stemming from his efforts to cover up an extramarital affair. He also pleaded no contest to charges of assaulting a police officer attempting to serve a subpoena on a Kilpatrick friend in that case. He was accused of blocking a criminal investigation into his office and firing a police deputy to cover up the affair.",

    "input": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistani authorities have arrested two top leaders of the Islamic militant group India blames for the November massacre in Mumbai, Pakistan's prime minister confirmed Wednesday. Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said Pakistani security forces had rounded up a number of militant figures. The top military officer in the U.S. on Wednesday said he is \"encouraged\" by Pakistan's recent arrests of \"significant players\" in the Mumbai attacks. U.S. Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen said the arrests amount to \"first steps\" toward determining who plotted the three day siege last month that killed 160 people in Mumbai, India's financial capital. \"There are more steps to follow,\" he noted. He also thanked India for showing restraint against Pakistan, which it has accused of harboring the terrorist groups behind the November massacre. Zarar Shah, a top operational commander of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, and Zakir Rehman Lakhvi, whose arrest had been reported Tuesday, were among the militant figures rounded up in recent days, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told reporters. Gilani would not confirm the detention of Masood Azhar, the leader of another militant group, Jaish-e-Muhammad. But he said his government has launched its own investigation into India's allegations that the gunmen who killed more than 160 people in Mumbai had links to Pakistan. The acknowledgment came three days after Pakistani security forces raided an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, in the first sign of government action against Lashkar-e-Tayyiba since the three-day siege of India's financial capital. Both LeT and Jaish-e-Muhammad were formed to battle Indian rule in the divided Himalayan territory of Kashmir, and both were banned after a 2001 attack on the Indian parliament that brought the South Asian nuclear rivals to the brink of war. The United States has listed LeT as a terrorist group with ties to Osama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. According to the U.S. government, Lakhvi, 47, has directed LeT's military operations in southeast Asia, Chechnya, Bosnia and Iraq. Pakistan's Defense Minister Choudhry Mukhtar Ahmed told CNN's sister network in India, CNN-IBN, that Lakhvi and Azhar had been arrested on Monday. Azhar has been in Pakistan since 1999, when he was released from an Indian prison in exchange for hostages aboard a hijacked Indian airliner. Indian authorities say the sole surviving gunman in the Mumbai attacks told investigators that he was trained at an LeT camp near Muzaffarabad, along with the nine other attackers who were killed in the three-day siege. A Pakistani security official said the terror raids on banned militant groups are ongoing and have resulted in at least 15 arrests.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Rebels in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo began withdrawing from the key eastern city of Goma on Saturday, witnesses said, more than a week after they seized it from government forces. Fighters from the M23 rebel group boarded trucks and other vehicles to head north to outside of the 20 kilometer (12 mile) buffer zone stipulated by regional leaders, a reporter on the ground who was not named for his safety said. Earlier they had begun leaving Sake, a town to the west of Goma. M23 rebels also left their posts at the border crossing with Rwanda, but remained in some parts of Goma as of early afternoon. Tensions mounted in the city as several disputes arose. The M23 wanted to take a large cache of ammunition left by fleeing Congolese soldiers, the reporter said, but MONUSCO, the U.N. peacekeeping force for DR Congo, prevented the rebels from doing so. MONUSCO forces also stopped the rebels from taking vehicles donated to the government by the European Union. The rebel group has been accused of widespread looting by the United Nations and Goma residents. Government forces also looted as they fled last week, witnesses said. The United Nations welcomed M23's move, but said the group must cease military activity and stay outside of Goma. \"We welcome this withdrawal, but emphasize that this is an early step and that stability in the region remains very fragile,\" said Kieran Dwyer, spokesperson for U.N. peacekeepers. Regional leaders and the African Union had called for the rebels' withdrawal from Goma, supposed to have been completed by Thursday, as a condition of starting negotiations. The regional leaders' plan foresees an integrated force being deployed for an initial period of three months at Goma airport, Ugandan Gen. Aronda Nyakairima said earlier this week. It would include a 100-strong neutral force, which would be in command, 100 troops from the Congolese army, and 100 members of the M23, Nyakairima said. Two military observers would also be deployed from each of the neighboring regional powers, while MONUSCO would be responsible for securing the buffer zone outside Goma, he said. The regional leaders also called on the rebels to \"stop all war activities,\" and \"stop talk of overthrowing an elected government.\" The latest violence has forced more than 140,000 people to flee their homes, according to the U.N. refugee agency, on top of those already forced from their homes by previous rounds of fighting in the volatile region. And aid groups warn the conflict risks triggering a broader humanitarian crisis. Why Congo needs our help . The M23 group was named for a peace deal of March 23, 2009, which it accuses the government of violating. The soldiers, mostly Tutsis, became part of the national army through that accord. However, they broke away from the Congolese army in April, complaining they weren't being promoted as promised, and because of a lack of pay and poor conditions. The latest unrest continues a cycle of misery in eastern DR Congo, a mineral-rich region at the epicenter of political and ethnic conflict involving its neighbors to the east, Uganda and Rwanda. The area has been embroiled in violence since 1994, when Hutu forces crossed the border from Rwanda fearing reprisals after the genocide in that country. Why the world is ignoring Congo war .",

John Kivett of the Hoke County sheriff's office. \"No one has been taken into custody. It's still an ongoing investigation. Nothing has been seized,\" he told CNN. The heavily edited videotape from the animal rights group shows what appear to be employees of the farm kicking, dragging and throwing turkeys. During one section of the tape, someone clearly swings what appears to be a metal object, striking one of the birds. Investigators were trying to determine whether the videotape matches this same facility in Hoke County that they were searching. \"Veterinarians and detectives are inside the birdhouses conducting their investigation and documenting what they see,\" said Kivett. \"We have no way of knowing if the video is of the same place,\" he told CNN. Other sections of the 90-second tape show what appear to be injured, bloodied and, in some cases, dead turkeys. On its website, the animal rights group bills itself as an organization that promotes a vegetarian diet. \"Our investigation found Butterball employees kicking, throwing, dragging and beating birds. We also documented birds suffering from broken bones, bloody open wounds, and many left to die,\" said Nathan Runkle, executive director of Mercy for Animals. The sheriff's department said that Butterball was fully cooperating with the authorities, and that company officials were at the farm. In a written statement, Butterball said the company was working with Hoke County officials in their investigation. \"Butterball takes these allegations very seriously and fully supports the efforts being made on the part of officials. Butterball has a zero tolerance policy for any mistreatment of our birds or the failure to immediately report mistreatment of our birds by any associates,\" the company said in a statement. \"We are performing extensive internal and third-party audits as part of our own investigation. Employees found in violation of Butterball's animal welfare policies will be subject to immediate termination.\" The company statement did not address the existence or the nature of the videotape. Butterball did not return CNN's calls for comment. The animal rights group told CNN that a female member of the organization was hired by Butterball as a driver, and as a worker in the animal sheds. The organization said the unidentified member worked there from the middle of November until the middle of December when the hidden-camera video was shot. \"These animals experience pain and suffering in the same way as dogs and cats. As a civilized society it's our moral obligation to prevent needless cruelty to animals including those raised for food,\" said Runkle. North Carolina law states that any person who intentionally wounds, injures, torments or kills any animal could be guilty of committing a misdemeanor or a felony, depending upon the level of infraction as determined by investigators.",

The 21-year-old had gone into the final as the underdog against three-time grand slam champion Sharapova, but belied that status with a high-class display on Centre Court. She is the third Czech woman, after Martina Navratilova and Jana Novotna, to claim the Wimbledon singles crown. Both were in the Royal Box to witness her triumph and Kvitova paid them both a compliment as she savored her victory. \"It's hard to find some words, to see the great players in the Royal Box,\" said Kvitova, the first left-hander since Navratilova in 1990 to win the title. \"It's very nice when they're watching me all the time and supporting me, it's great.\" Russia's Sharapova was bidding to repeat her success as 17-year-old in 2004, but despite breaking Kvitova in her very first service game was largely second-best against an opponent hitting with pace and accuracy. Eighth seed Kvitova, beaten in the semifinals by eventual winner Serena Williams last year, responded with two breaks of Sharapova's service to take the first set in 40 minutes. She immediately broke Sharapova at the start of the second set and appeared to be in control, but the fifth seed retrieved it to level at two games all. Sharapova looked to gain momentum but she surrendered her service again only to show great resilience to break back again. But it was her last glimpse of glory as Kvitova broke again for 4-3 to close on her maiden grand slam title. Serving for the championship at 5-4, Kvitova carved out three match points and clinched it with an ace, sinking to the turf in triumph. But in contrast, it was a bitter disappointment for Sharapova, who has battled back to the top of the game after serious shoulder surgery. \"It's great to be back at this stage and holding the runner-up plate -- but I wanted the big one today,\" said Sharapova. \"But it's something I want to be back for and holding again one day.\" Defending champion Rafael Nadal and new world No.1 Novak Djokovic contest the men's singles final Sunday.",

A Black Man's View of America.\" Visit his Web site for more information. Roland Martin says fathers across America are failing their children by shirking their responsibilities. (CNN) -- \"I'll kill all y'all.\" Imagine looking at the man whose DNA you carry standing in your home, telling you those chilling words, as he wields a shotgun. The frightening image is a scary thought. But according to former Major League Baseball star Darryl Strawberry, it was an actual scene, one that begins his book, \"Straw: Finding My Way.\" I vividly remember the towering home runs hit by the former star, who played for four big league teams, including the New York Mets and Yankees -- and of course, the many times he was in the news for failing drug tests, beating wives, getting cancer twice, going to prison. He was a man fighting enormous demons. Yet as I read the book, there is one consistent theme that runs throughout and that sheds a spotlight on a figure that continues to plague neighborhoods all across the country: the missing-in-action father. Strawberry makes a point repeatedly in \"Straw\" that he does not blame his dad for the trials and tribulations in his life; he says all decisions he made willingly. But he does speak to the issue of having a father who, by Strawberry's account, while technically in the house, was a raging drunk who spent his paycheck doing what he wanted, showing no love and affection towards his children, viciously beating Strawberry and his brother, all while telling them that they would be nothing in life.  Watch Darryl Strawberry talk to Roland Martin about his father Â» . \"I grew up in an inner city, South Central Los Angeles. When you grow up in the inner cities, most young men don't have a father figure around. Most mothers are raising the kids,\" he told me in an interview. He later said, \"I loved playing baseball; I loved playing basketball; excelling and achieving my goals was my own personal goals, but inside, I just never loved myself. I can remember the times when I excelled in baseball and I [would] do extremely well and the cheers and the glitter and everything that came along with it, but you know what, Roland? When I went home at night, here was I again, me myself, [asking] 'Who am I?' \" The cynical in our world undoubtedly will say, \"Who cares about a drugged-out, washed-up ballplayer?\" But the mental damage that Strawberry says wreaked havoc on him as a child cannot be discounted, and it's something that millions of young children, especially boys, are growing up with every day. This isn't a tale of the stereotypical black athlete who grows up with the black father not in the home, leading to the cycle of violence and lack of family unity we see all around the country. Strawberry's dad was there. But, according to the former ballplayer, he was a horrible father. And right now, there are also young white boys in suburban and rural America who have dads in the home, physically, yet they have mentally and emotionally checked out. And the same for Hispanics and Asians. It has gotten to the point that a mother is considered essential in a family, but a father is optional, expendable, and increasingly irrelevant. I remember watching an OnStar commercial. And as the company touted the features, it showed a father driving his child around, and when the kid starts to cry, the dad freaks out and has to quickly call the mom to calm the baby down. I'm watching that and saying, \"Man, it's your child, too! So calm it!\" Then there is the commercial -- I don't even remember what they were pitching -- of two or three kids in the kitchen making a mess after spilling the cereal. The hapless and hopeless dad looks at them and says, \"Where is your mom?\" Every time that commercial comes on I scream at the TV, \"Where is your mom? Where are your parenting skills, you ingrate!\" See, I take seriously the importance of fathers -- men -- in the lives of children. My wife and I don't have children of our own, but we are raising four of my nieces because they were struggling at home. They need to see a husband and a wife caring for them, but also instilling the right values in their lives. I am convinced that our city streets have turned into killing fields because dads have abdicated their responsibility in the raising of their children. Yes, mom is vital. But there is something different about dad speaking, lecturing, cajoling, disciplining, embracing, loving and caring. Our schools are filled with children losing their minds, and teachers unable to control them. When that happens, it's typically mom, grandma or an aunt coming to the school to deal with the problem. Ask a teacher or principal today and they will say they rarely see dads. My mom has gotten ticked at times because I often talk more about my father than her on TV or radio. It's not that I don't love or appreciate her. But I do it because it is rare to hear men, especially black men, speaking affirmatively about their fathers. I know what it means to have a dad raising and caring for you, and not seeing his child in a drive-by style, or just sending a check. Dads must be present and accounted for, playing a vital role in their children's life. That's why I appreciated it when President Obama spoke about the issue of fatherhood on the campaign trail. We all know the story of his father leaving when he was 2 years old. And yes, he was able to be successful. But for every Obama, there are numerous boys who aren't able to hold it together. I've called on pastors nationwide to stop the stream of momma, grandmother, aunts and female cousins coming to the altar for baby dedications with no man in sight. That pastor should say, \"Until I personally meet with the father, I will not dedicate this child.\" Somebody has to hold that man accountable for his actions. It's time that men hold their \"boys\" accountable. Actor Hill Harper had a friend who once said that he hadn't seen his child in some time, but he found time to play basketball with Harper. Hill said, \"Unless you call your child now, we can't play ball.\" See, Hill had to force him to accept his responsibilities. The failure of manhood in America -- fatherhood -- has reached epidemic proportions. And unless our religious and cultural institutions say enough is enough, we are going to see another generation of children growing up with dad absent and unaccounted for. It's time for men to man up, so children can grow up with an equal amount of love and affection from both parents. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland Martin.",

In addition, the three-month period of January, February and March was the warmest first quarter ever recorded in the Lower 48 states. The average was 42 degrees Fahrenheit, a whopping 6 degrees above the long-term average. A staggering 15,292 warm temperature records were broken, (7,755 record highs and 7,517 record high overnight lows), according to Chris Vaccaro, spokesperson for NOAA. \"That's tremendously excessive. The scope and the scale of warmth was really unprecedented, Vaccaro said. A persistent weather pattern during the month of March led to 25 states east of the Rockies having their warmest March on record, NOAA said. That same pattern was responsible for cooler-than-average conditions in the West Coast states of Washington, Oregon and California, they said. The warm temperatures also contributed to conditions that were favorable for severe thunderstorms and tornadoes. There were 223 preliminary tornado reports during March, a month that averages 80 tornadoes, according to NOAA's Storm Prediction Center. The majority of these tornadoes occurred during a severe weather outbreak across the Ohio River Valley and Southeast in early March. The outbreak caused 40 deaths and total losses of $1.5 billion, making it the first billion-dollar disaster of 2012. Short-term weather patterns such as the one that affected the United States are poor indicators of global climate trends, however.

Akiva Mafa'i, who was badly injured two decades ago during his service in the Israel Defense Forces, had set himself alight Sunday. The 45-year-old poured gasoline over his body and ignited it at a bus station in the town of Yehud. Passersby extinguished the flames with bottles of water and a fire extinguisher but he was left with 70% burns. The veteran had spent four months in a coma at the Beer Sheva Medical Center after he was injured at age 23, according to local media reports. He was to be married a month after he was hurt but the marriage was canceled. Mafa'i is the second person to die in a self-immolation in Israel in less than a week. Moshe Silman, a bed-ridden member of a movement to lower the cost of living in Israel, set himself alight during a demonstration in Tel Aviv on July 14. He died two weeks later. Teenage monk self-immolates in China . According to local media reports, he left a note accusing the conservative Netanyahu government of \"taking from the poor and giving to the rich.\" Israeli media have reported other suicide attempts apparently motivated by economic hardship. The social protest movement has been gaining ground since large demonstrations were held in cities last summer, led by members of Israel's middle class, over soaring costs of living. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described the self-immolations as tragic. Such incidents are unusual in Israel. A self-immolation in Tunisia in December 2010 by Mohamed Bouazizi, a young street vendor, was the spark that ignited the protests and revolutionary fervor of the Arab Spring. The desperate measure is a more common form of protest in some Asian nations, in particular for Tibetans who want autonomy from China. Some 44 Tibetans, many of them monks, have self-immolated since 2009, according to the Central Tibetan Administration, which functions as the government of Tibetans outside the Chinese territory.

Chinese official interference with Tibetan Buddhist monasteries and nunneries contributed to at least a dozen self-immolations in 2011, according to the U.S. State Department's International Religious Freedom report. In Europe, where self-immolation is also a rare form of protest, a 55-year-old Greek businessman set himself alight last September, overwhelmed by despair and anger over the debt crisis engulfing himself and his country. Apostolos Polyzonis, who survived after being rescued by police and spending days in intensive care, told CNN in April: \"At that moment, I saw my life as worthless. I really didn't care if I was going to live or die.\" My Take: Dalai Lama should condemn self-immolations .",

The report lists a number of military grids where the Americans were believed to have been hiking or had been detained -- all on the Iraqi side of the border, according to The New York Times, which reviewed the document with aid from an American government official. \"This has been suggested publicly before,\" State Department spokesman P.J.

The deadlock was broken seven minutes after the break, when Peru goalkeeper Raul Fernandez could only parry Diego Forlan's shot and Suarez, 24, found the net from an acute angle. Copa America flops: Who is to blame? Victory was sealed for Oscar Tabarez's side when Suarez rushed onto a lofted ball up field before rounding Fernandez and rolling a low shot into the unguarded goal. Suarez now has three goals in the tournament, which leaves him level with Argentina's Sergio Aguero as the competition's top goal scorer. Peru's misery was complete on 68 minutes with the dismissal of their captain Juan Manuel Vargas for an elbow on defender Sebastian Coates. \"This victory is important,\" Uruguay right-back Alvaro Pereira told the tournament's official web site. \"I'm very happy, but we must keep our feet on the ground. This team has demonstrated an amazing hunger for glory and now we must think about what is and how we did from the beginning, when we thought all games were finals. \"There are always mistakes and we made mistakes [against Peru], but now we must correct them and hopefully we can win this cup.\" The final will take place in Buenos Aires' Estadio Monumental on Sunday.",

In an Air Force file photo, an airman inspects a missile part at a training site. A \"nuclear surety inspection\" and \"unit compliance inspection\" was conducted this month on the 90th Missile Wing at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming by an Air Force inspector general. There was no risk to the unit's Minuteman III nuclear missiles, Air Force officials said. The unit has 90 days to correct the problems and pass another inspection. In the wake of recent problems, Defense Secretary Robert Gates and top Air Force officials have indicated a zero tolerance for failing inspections, but no punishments are expected in this case, officials said. The inspection report found the maintenance unit failed to document tests conducted on missiles correctly, including tests on safety devices. The inspector general told the unit the failures indicated either a \"lack of competence\" or \"disregard for procedures,\" according to a source who has seen the report. Additionally, failures included having some personnel on duty without proper medical clearance and failure to inspect radiation detectors. Other units that failed inspections this year included two bomb wings and two missile units.",

    "input": "Cairo (CNN) -- As protesters battled supporters of Egyptian President Mohamed Morsy outside his palace, his chief of staff announced Thursday that the president would address the nation later in the day. The chief of staff, Refaa El-Tahtawy, said the speech would include important news but did not specify what that might be. The announcement came hours after demonstrations erupted into violence Wednesday night over Morsy's assumption of sweeping powers last month. Three of Morsy's advisers resigned Wednesday in protest of his edict, while demonstrators set fire to offices of the Muslim Brotherhood and its political arm, the Freedom and Justice Party, in three cities. The unrest comes as Egypt lurches toward a scheduled December 15 referendum on a new constitution. Days of largely peaceful protests in Tahrir Square had preceded Wednesday's violence. But that all changed Wednesday. After Morsy supporters chased protesters from the grounds, pro- and anti-Morsy demonstrators threw rocks, fireworks and Molotov cocktails at each other. Late in the day, a spokesman for the Muslim Brotherhood called on protesters to withdraw from the area of the palace \"and not to protest there again due to its significant symbolic position as the president's office.\" The Health Ministry reported four were killed and 271 were injured; state media reported earlier in the night that no one was killed. Dr. Mohamed Sultan, a spokesman for the ministry, said the injuries ranged from bruises to cuts, burns and fractures. More marches were promised for Thursday, said Rami Shath, a member of the Revolutionary Alliance and the Free Egyptian Party. \"We hold opposition figures, namely Sabbahi & ElBaradei, fully responsible for escalation of violence & inciting their supporters,\" said the Muslim Brotherhood in a tweet, referring to opposition leaders Hamdeen Sabbahi and Mohamed ElBaradei. Morsy, Egypt's first freely elected leader, was a Muslim Brotherhood leader before winning office in June, when he resigned from the movement and the Freedom and Justice Party to represent all Egyptians, he said. Demonstrators were protesting his recent edict granting himself sweeping powers and the proposed constitution -- drafted by an Islamist-dominated council -- that they fear will give him even more power. \"This is not what we asked for,\" one protester said. \"It's a complete dictatorship.\" Other protesters vowed to remain in the streets until Morsy is forced to leave office. \"He's not our president anymore,\" another protester said. The three advisers who announced their resignations said they had done so after failing to persuade Morsy to reverse his November 23 decree. \"He has rejected all our suggestions and initiatives that may have avoided the cycle of violence we are witnessing today,\" Ayman al-Sayad, Seif Abdel Fattah, and Mohammed Esmat said in a joint statement. But the powerful Muslim Brotherhood called the protesters \"thugs\" who were trying to overthrow the president. \"By the grace of God, the Egyptian people will be able to protect this legitimacy, its constitution and its institutions,\" the group said on its Facebook page. Ahmed Sobea, a spokesman of the Freedom and Justice Party, said the party's offices in the northeastern cities of Suez and Ismailia had been ransacked and torched by masked, armed men on Wednesday night. The offices were empty when the attacks occurred, Sobea said. State-run Nile TV broadcast pictures of the Ismaila office on fire and reported that other masked men had burned the Muslim Brotherhood headquarters in the northeastern city of Zagazig. Opposition leaders are prepared to open talks with Morsy if he withdraws his edict and delays the referendum, said ElBaradei, leader of the liberal Constitution Party and a Nobel Peace Prize laureate. But Vice President Mahmoud Mekki said the referendum will be held as planned. \"Saying the referendum will be held on time is not being stubborn,\" Mekki said. \"The president has backtracked from decisions before; he's not a stubborn character.\" Morsy's decree placed his decisions out of the reach of courts until a new constitution is approved. He said the move was designed to protect the spirit of the popular 2011 uprising that drove former strongman Hosni Mubarak from power. Critics call it a power grab. Egyptian judges and media outlets as well as liberal political groups have protested Morsy's decree and the proposed constitution, saying it goes against the goals of the revolution. How the struggle plays out could have repercussions across the Middle East and North Africa, regions already wracked by upheaval. In nearby Gaza and Israel, tensions remain high after last month's fighting. In Syria, a civil war has raged since March 2011. Wednesday's violence followed clashes Tuesday outside the palace, which has become the focus of protests by Egypt's liberal opposition. On Tuesday night, police fired tear gas after anti-Morsy protesters broke through barbed wire around the palace and hurled chairs and rocks at retreating officers. After the initial clashes, police withdrew behind fences and the demonstration was peaceful for several hours. Yassir Ali, a spokesman for the presidential office and the vice president, told reporters Wednesday that the presidential office had ordered the security forces at the palace \"to protect the protesters and keep them safe.\" \"The orders to the security forces were not to confront (them), (but) to preserve the lives of the protesters and to prevent any clashes between the security forces and the protesters,\" Ali said. CNN's Reza Sayah and Journalists Mohamed Fadel Fahmy and Sarah Sirgany reported from Cairo, CNN's Michael Pearson, Joe Sterling, Saad Abedine and Yousuf Basil reported from Atlanta, and Sarah Brown and Laura Smith-Spark reported from London.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- When Tiger Woods ended his 30-month wait for a PGA Tour title in March, the golf world was excited by the prospect of the 14-time major champion blitzing the Masters field on his old stomping ground at Augusta. He didn't. He flopped, finishing tied for 40th. Woods then missed the cut at Quail Hollow and shared 40th at the Players Championship. So what can we expect at next week's U.S. Open, where he has already been installed as the oddsmakers' favorite after thrilling fans with his 73rd PGA Tour title on Sunday, chipping in with one of the best shots of his career? \"The timing couldn't have been better, it means a lot for him to win in front of his hero Jack Nicklaus,\" says Golf.com deputy editor David Dusek. \"If he plays at that level, if he's able to hit fairways and find the putting stroke that he showed in Ohio, then Tiger Woods is definitely going to be one of the contenders at the U.S. Open.\" That can only be good for golf. The PGA Tour's broadcaster CBS Sports reported that Sunday's ratings increased 138% from last year, being the event's best result since 2004. The season's second major will be held at the Olympic Club in San Francisco, where Woods revealed he practiced the week before going to Nicklaus' Memorial Tournament. \"I hit the ball well there. I said, 'Hey, that's as good a prep as any for this event, if I can hit the ball well there.' I just basically carried that into this event and hit it great all week.\" Woods acknowledged that his victory at the Arnold Palmer Invitational had covered up some of the deficiencies in his game before the Masters as he was still coming to terms with his new swing. \"At Bay Hill I played well on that Sunday, but I just didn't quite have the control I did here. That was different. I'm able to hit the ball, I think, compressing it higher than I did at Bay Hill,\" he told reporters. \"I was comfortable hitting it down, uncomfortable hitting it up. As I said at Augusta to you guys, I got exposed, wasn't able to get the ball up in the air comfortably, and it showed. \"I went to work on it for the next few weeks, and I finally got it. It came around here when I needed it. This is a high-ball golf course. You've got to get the ball up in the air and you've got to land it soft, and I did it.\" While the technique being instilled by coach Sean Foley is finally paying off for Woods, Dusek says more importantly the 36-year-old is rediscovering the \"X-Factor\" that made him the world's best-paid athlete. \"He's got his putter going a little bit, he was hitting fairways, and as we saw with that shot on 16 it would be appear that there's a level of magic surrounding this guy that he's able to summon. Not as consistently as he used to, but it's still there,\" Dusek told CNN. \"Obviously the technique has to be there, he has to put the club face on the ball and to execute his shot, but golf probably more than any other sport relies on the proverbial 15th club -- which is the confidence between your ears that you can pull this off. \"Tiger Woods obviously has a lot of confidence right now, and he should -- there's only a couple of other players on the U.S. PGA Tour this season who have two wins, and he's one of them along with Jason Dufner and Hunter Mahan.\" Dusek believes that the way is clear for Woods to win his first major title since 2008, when he famously triumphed at the U.S. Open in a playoff despite suffering a serious knee injury that would sideline him for the rest of that year. \"We've seen Rory McIlroy miss three straight cuts, we've seen (world No. 1) Luke Donald not really be much of a factor, and (five-time U.S. Open runner-up) Phil Mickelson having to pull out (at Memorial) citing fatigue,\" Dusek said. \"Tiger Woods then wins his 73rd championship and it's so tantalizing a story that leading up to the U.S. Open next week that his form once again seems to be ramping up.\" The tournament was last held at Olympic Club in 1998, when a 23-year-old Woods tied for 18th. \"It's way different than in '98. They've added some serious length there,\" he said. \"We were hitting different clubs off the tees and different sight lines, and they've shifted a couple of the fairways over, and all new green complexes. You know, my book is useless from '98.\" So what does Woods think -- is he really back? \"I'll just keep going, keep working on it. This is a process, and I'm just trying to get better.\"",

    "input": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- A U.S. Marine in Iraq has been removed from duty amid complaints that he was handing out coins with Bible verses at an American checkpoint, the military said Thursday. A military spokesman said Iraqis in Falluja complained that the Marine was giving the coins, which were printed in Arabic, to people at an entry control point in Falluja. U.S. military regulations prohibit religious proselytizing. \"This has our full attention,\" said Col. James L. Welsh, chief of staff of Multi-National Force, West. \"We deeply value our relationship with the local citizens and share their concerns over this serious incident.\" At least one of the coins is stamped with the words \"Where will you spend eternity?\" according to a report published Thursday by McClatchy Newspapers. The other side of the coin reportedly contains a verse from John 3:16 that reads, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish, but have eternal life.\" Several Falluja residents said they were given the coins over a two-day period and complained that U.S. troops, whom they consider foreign occupiers, were acting as Christian missionaries. \"Regulations prohibit members of the coalition force from proselytizing any religion, faith or practices,\" said Col. Bill Buckner, a coalition spokesman. \"Our troops are trained on those guidelines before they deploy.\" A military statement said \"appropriate action\" will be taken if the reports are substantiated. The reports stoked religious concerns in Iraq just weeks after Iraqi police discovered that a U.S. soldier had used the Quran, Islam's holy book, for target practice. The U.S. commander in Baghdad took the unusual step of holding a public ceremony and reading a letter of apology from the soldier, a sniper section leader, to local Iraqi leaders. Many in attendance were members and leaders of Sunni militias that the U.S. military has courted to help fight al Qaeda in Iraq and other insurgents. Sunnis often face criticism from other Iraqis for cooperating with American troops. Falluja, also a mostly Sunni city, was the scene of bitter and bloody fighting early in the Iraq war between U.S. troops, al Qaeda in Iraq and Sunni insurgents loyal to Saddam Hussein.",

It's this analysis and recommendation system that has turned Pandora into a Internet music powerhouse. \"Adding comedians to the mix has been one of the top requests from our listeners,\" Pandora said in a blog post, \"so we've taken the same approach to comedy as we have to music: carefully and deliberately analyzing comedic 'bits' across a very large number of attributes to capture the style, delivery and content of each performance.\" Some of the comedians that are now available on Pandora include Chris Rock, Jerry Seinfeld, Eddie Murphy, George Carlin, Mitch Hedberg and John Rivers, according to The New York Times. And like its musical counterpart, comedy on Pandora will also come with audio advertisements. Unilever is Pandora's first advertiser and will be promoting its Axe male body products and Klondike bars. Once at the brink of destruction, Pandora has bounced back and is now preparing for an IPO that is expected to raise at least $100 million for the Internet radio company.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Kei Nishikori became the first Japanese male to reach the quarterfinals of the Australian Open since 1932 when he held on to earn a shock five-set win over sixth seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on Monday. Nishikori, ranked 26th in the world, blew a two-set lead before beating the Frenchman for the second time in his career, triumphing 2-6 6-2 6-1 3-6 6-3 in three and a half hours. The 22-year-old, who will next face world No. 4 Andy Murray, beat his previous best grand slam performance -- reaching the fourth round of the 2008 U.S. Open. He is the first Japanese male player to reach the last eight of one of the four majors since Shuzo Matsuoka at Wimbledon in 1995. \"This is the first quarterfinal for me,\" an exhausted Nishikori, told reporters after his second successive five-set match. \"I feel I'm stepping up. It was tough because he was still playing well in the fifth. I was having trouble with making returns. I started getting nervous ... But still I was playing aggressive on important points. I was making good serves. So that helped me to get the games.\" Nishikori beat world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in the Basel semis in October before losing to Roger Federer, having learned a lesson in his thrashing by Murray in the last four in Shanghai in his preceding tournament. \"He kind of destroyed me. But I have no pressure now. He's one of the players I have to play like him. I learn a lot of things from him. It's going to be tough, but I try to do my best tennis.\" Nishikori said he hoped he could inspire Asian men's players, as China's Li Na did for the region's women last year by reaching the Australian Open final and then winning the French Open. \"It's an honor to make a lot of histories, to be the No. 1 player in Japan. But that never gives me pressure,\" said Nishikori, who is a graduate of the Nick Bollettieri academy in Florida which has produced many top players such as Andre Agassi, the Williams sisters and Maria Sharapova.. \"There's a lot of good players in Asia. But, yeah, I'm happy to get to the top from Asia, and hopefully I can be like Li Na for the men.\" Fourth seed Murray, the runner-up in Melbourne for the last two years, was coasting 6-1 6-1 1-0 against Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin when the world No. 92 was forced to retire with a left hip flexor injury. \"I'll definitely be fresh for the next few rounds hopefully,\" said Murray, who has yet to win a first grand slam title despite reaching four finals. \"I just need to make sure I do the right things the next couple days to get ready for the quarters.\" Top seed and defending champion Novak Djokovic survived a spirited third-set fightback from former world No. 1 and home-crowd favorite Lleyton Hewitt to seal a 6-1 6-3 4-6 6-3 triumph in the late match. Hewitt, granted a wildcard for the tournament after a long fitness struggle has seen him dropped to 181st in the rankings, showed glimpses of the form which took him to two grand slam titles. But Djokovic -- a four-time grand slam winner including three major titles in 2011 -- eventually proved too strong and the Serbian world No. 1 eventually saw off the 30-year-old Hewitt in just under three hours in a match that went past 1 a.m. local time. \"I played some loose points and got him back into the match. But credit to him as well for being competitive, for not giving up,\" Djokovic said. \"This is something you can expect from Lleyton who is very well-known for his fighting spirit. He had the crowd, he had the big support. It got intense. Especially the start of the fourth set we had some great rallies.\" Fifth seed David Ferrer awaits Djokovic in the next round after the Spaniard eased to a 6-4 6-4 6-1 victory against French No. 17 Richard Gasquet. Seventh seed Tomas Berdych booked his place in the last eight with a four-set success against Spanish No. 10 Nicolas Almagro on Sunday, but the Czech was booed by the Hisense Arena crowd for refusing to shake his opponent's hand at the end of the match. It followed an incident in the fourth set where Berdych accused Almagro of purposefully aiming a volley at his face, with the ball striking him on the arm. \"Whoever has played the tennis knows that the court is pretty big, and you always have some space to put the ball in,\" said Berdych told reporters. \"And not even if you stand each other like three or four meters close to the guy, just try to hit it straight to your face, you know. I was just able and lucky to somehow fell down. \"I already take it as a past, it's just one thing that what happened from the side of Nico ... So I think if they want to look at it like that, then I think maybe we both did some mistake.\" Berdych's last-eight opponent will be 2009 champion Rafael Nadal, the second seed who beat fellow Spaniard Feliciano Lopez 6-4 6-4 6-2.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Former British army officer William Shaw, who was serving a two-year sentence in Kabul's infamous Pul-e-Charki jail for bribery, has been acquitted, his daughter told CNN on Sunday. Daughter Lisa Luckyn-Malone could not provide additional information. Afghan officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Shaw, who served 28 years in the British forces, was sentenced for bribery in April -- accused of paying $25,000 to an Afghan intelligence official. Bribery under Afghan law requires the person who received the money to be a government employee. That was not the case for Shaw, according to his lawyer, Kimberly Motely. Shaw's employer, security company G4S, authorized him to pay the $25,000 in good faith as a fee to the Afghan intelligence service to have two vehicles released from their custody. That was in October 2009, and the vehicles were released. At the request of G4S, Shaw returned to the intelligence service on several occasions to ask for receipts for the cash, according to his family. Five months later, he was called in to the intelligence service for questioning and arrested. The former military serviceman who once received a top award from the Queen was sent to the Afghan super-max jail and locked up in solitary confinement. The Afghan intelligence service had sent two letters to the judges dealing with Shaw's case informing them the man who took the $25,000 from Shaw was not a government employee, according to Motely. The British Embassy in Afghanistan said it was pleased for Shaw and his family. \"We welcome the appeal court's decision which is now subject to finalization in the Supreme Court,\" an embassy spokeswoman said. \"The UK continues to strongly support the work of the Afghan government to counter corruption and reinforce the rule of law in Afghanistan.\"",

Speaking after an emergency meeting of power-sharing ministers in Belfast, First Minister Peter Robinson said the government water company's efforts to restore water supplies to tens of thousands of homes was \"shambolic\" and \"ineffective.\" He said a review would now be carried out by ministers and hinted at action against Northern Ireland Water's top executives . \"People must assess their own position, and of course if people don't assess their own position the review will look at where responsibility lies and decisions will be taken on the foot of that,\" said Robinson. Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness was also highly critical of the response, calling it \"totally unacceptable behaviour by an arm's-length body\". \"We are not prepared to accept this treatment on behalf of citizens,\" he said. \"... Under no circumstances are we going to stand here and make excuses for a body that has failed so miserably.\" Northern Ireland Water said Thursday it could be early next week before all customers are reconnected. Up to 60,000 homes and businesses are experiencing water disruption, the company said in a written statement Thursday. Of those, 6,000 have lacked running water since Monday. However, on Tuesday some residents reported they had not had water for nine days. \"The numbers on a curtailed supply will vary from between 3,500 to 60,000 at any given time,\" the statement said. \"NI Water will continue to rotate supplies so figures will increase and decrease as this process is continued in order to protect reservoir levels.\" Northern Ireland Water has said the \"unprecedented problems\" were caused by a rapid thaw, with a huge number of pipes bursting after a dramatic change in temperature -- from minus-16 to 10 degrees Celsius (3 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit) \"within a matter of hours.\" Company officials have also complained about a lack of investment in the water infrastructure over the years. The company said it had increased the supply of water to its highest level ever -- from 600 million liters per day to 850 million liters per day (158 million gallons to 224 million gallons). \"This increase in demand is to a great degree as a result of leakage from bursts on private properties,\" the statement said. Doctors are warning of an increasing public health risk if the water shortages continue. Two hospitals have experienced supply problems. Emergency supplies were being made available at locations across the province, including recreation centers where those without running water were being offered free showers. The Scottish government has sent 160,000 liters (42,000 gallons) of bottled water to Northern Ireland after supplies ran out. Ahead of the meeting of ministers on Thursday, Ulster Unionist Party deputy leader John McCallister described the situation as \"Third World and horrendous.\" He added: \"If the executive at Stormont (the Belfast government) isn't able to deal with this, the UK government will have to take over -- that's how bad things are.\" In the Republic of Ireland, hundreds of thousands had supplies cut off or restricted, again as a result of burst pipes after the thaw. Repair crews worked to fix leaks, and mobile water supplies were being sent to the worst-hit areas. The Irish government said Thursday night most parts of the  country would see a resumption of normal water supply within the next two days,  but in the capital, Dublin, restrictions were expected to remain in place until January 10. Irish Minister for the Environment John Gormley said  significant progress was being made across the country to deal with water  leaks and stoppages. It was also announced restrictions on water supplies  were to be eased in most areas Friday night to facilitate New Year's Eve  celebrations.",

Speaking to the Arabic satellite network Al-Arabiya on Thursday, Bandar -- now Abdullah's national security adviser -- said Saudi intelligence was \"actively following\" most of the September 11, 2001, plotters \"with precision.\" \"If U.S. security authorities had engaged their Saudi counterparts in a serious and credible manner, in my opinion, we would have avoided what happened,\" he said.  Watch Bandar's comments Â» . Bandar was the Saudi ambassador to Washington for nearly 22 years before he was replaced in 2005. A knowledgeable U.S. official told CNN that Bandar's comments should be taken \"with a grain of salt.\" On Monday, Abdullah told the BBC that Saudi Arabia had sent warnings to British authorities before the London subway bombings that killed 52 people -- the city's bloodiest day since World War II. \"We have sent information to Great Britain before the terrorist attacks in Britain,\" Abdullah said. \"But unfortunately, no action was taken, and it may have been able to avert the tragedy.\" The September 11 attacks killed nearly 3,000 people in New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. All but four of the suicide hijackers who carried out the plot were Saudi nationals, and after the attacks, the kingdom was widely criticized for having tolerated Islamic militancy. The Saudis have called the criticism unfair, pointing out that al Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden's original grievance was against the country's ruling family, which invited U.S. troops into the kingdom after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990. A string of attacks on Western compounds, oil installations and Saudi institutions between 2003 and 2006 were blamed on al Qaeda's followers.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says this is a \"critical moment\" for that country, because it's a chance for Karzai to show what kind of government he'll lead. Clinton is visiting Afghanistan right now. She's scheduled to meet with Karzai while she's there. The Afghan president, under pressure to clean up corruption in his government, and Secretary Clinton is expected to talk with him about some guidelines that Afghanistan will have to meet in order to continue getting aid from the U.S. Clinton says that America wants to be partners with Afghanistan and with the Afghan people, and that is why President Obama has been reviewing the U.S. approach to the country. Nuclear Fears . AZUZ: No deal! That's what Iran seems to be saying about sending some of its nuclear materials to other countries. This plan was worked out at a meeting last month. Iran would send raw nuclear materials to other nations who would make it into nuclear fuel, and then that would go back to Iran to be used in medical facilities. But now, instead of sending out materials and getting them back later as fuel, one Iranian official is saying the country will only swap raw materials for already processed fuel, and the trade would have to happen in Iran.  All this is part of the ongoing tension over the Middle Eastern nation's nuclear program. Iran says it's only being used for peaceful reasons. But other countries believe Iran may be trying to build nuclear weapons. Terror Trial Debate . AZUZ: Well, there has been a lot of back-and-forth about the Obama Administration's decision to try a group of suspected 9/11 terrorists in a civilian court in New York City. A lot of people spoke out about this on our blog and in Congress, where Attorney General Eric Holder, who made the decision, talked about it yesterday. Samantha Hayes has our report on that. (BEGIN VIDEO) SAMANTHA HAYES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It's a move that's sparked a raging debate. ALICE HOAGLAND, MOTHER OF 9/11 VICTIM: I think I can speak for many 9/11 families when I say that we are heartsick. HAYES: On Capitol Hill Wednesday, Attorney General Eric Holder defended his decision to try five suspected 9/11 terrorists -- including alleged mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed -- in a civilian court, not a military tribunal. ERIC HOLDER, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: It was a decision that was case-driven. It's a decision based on the evidence that I know, that frankly, some of the people who have criticized the decision do not have access to. HAYES: Republican members of the Senate Judiciary Committee led the intense criticism of Holder's decision. SENATOR JON KYL, (R) ARIZONA: How could you be more likely to get a conviction in federal court when Khalid Sheik Mohammed has already asked to plead guilty before a military commission and be executed? HAYES: But Democrats who support the move expressed confidence in the court system and the ability of the city of New York to handle the trials, even though it was the epicenter of the 9/11 attacks. SEN. DIANNE FEINSTEIN, (D) CALIFORNIA: I happen to believe that New York City is able to handle this in a very professional and definitively legal manner. HAYES: And Holder said it in no way undermines the administration's commitment to fighting terror. HOLDER: We are at war, and we will use every instrument of national power -- civilian, military, law enforcement, intelligence, diplomatic and others -- to win. HAYES: Holder also told the panel that he is not concerned that a federal court could find the suspected terrorists not guilty. He said he has told prosecutors that these are cases that must be won.

MICHELLE WRIGHT, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. VandenHeuval's social studies classes at Dos Rios Elementary School in Tolleson, Arizona! Who is the longest-serving member in the history of the U.S. Congress? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it: A) Robert Byrd, B) Strom Thurmond, C) Harry Reid or D) Ted Stevens? You've got three seconds -- GO! Today is Senator Robert Byrd's 20,775th day serving in Congress. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Congressional History . AZUZ: Six years in the House of Representatives; elected to the U.S. Senate nine terms -- only person ever to do that -- it makes Sen. Byrd's total time representing residents of West Virginia 51 years so far. Plus, he's turning 92 tomorrow. As he became the longest-serving member of Congress yesterday, Byrd's years of service were praised by Democrats and Republicans. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell talked about Sen. Byrd's love for both the country and the Congress. And Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid predicted that many of Byrd's records will never be broken. Somalia Pirates . AZUZ: Deja vu in waters off the coast of the African nation of Somalia, when pirates tried to hijack a ship called the Maersk Alabama. If that sounds familiar to you, it's because that was the same ship that was hijacked back in April. A Navy operation rescued the crew members in that incident. And yesterday, a private security team on board the Maersk kept the attempted hijackers from taking over. When we talk about pirates, we don't mean \"of the Caribbean.\" These are very dangerous people with guns; they hold ships for ransom; they're very active in this part of the world. Is this Legit? MATT CHERRY, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? The African elephant is the largest animal on land. This one's true. These animals can grow to be 9 tons; that's 18,000 pounds! Elephant Orphanage . AZUZ: Okay -- that's the full-grown version, but even the babies are huge! African elephants can still weigh around 220 pounds at birth! But big doesn't necessarily mean safe. They're losing their habitat; they're being hunted by poachers: Baby elephants can face a lot of threats in the wild, and not having a mother around doesn't make it any easier. David McKenzie examines a program in Kenya that's trying to help orphaned elephants. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAVID MCKENZIE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They grow up to be one of Africa's giants, but like all creatures, they start off pretty small. Dwarfed by their keepers, each orphaned elephant at the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust has a tragic tale. This is Sala. She's 6 weeks old. They say her mother died because of starvation in the Kenyan drought. The person who found her gave her cow's milk, which is extremely harmful to elephants because of the fat. Sala wandered into a tourist camp in Kenya's Sala National Park, alone and confused. The orphanage scrambled a plane to rescue her. Carefully strapped in and traumatized, they evacuated Sala to Nairobi. For weeks, she was too sick to stand. Three days ago, she started walking again. If she makes it, she won't be alone. Drought, poaching and shrinking habitats have decimated elephant herds across East Africa. And the orphanage is fuller than it's been in 30 years. Still, Dame Daphne Sheldrick will take more. DAME DAPHNE SHELDRICK, DAVID SHELDRICK WILDLIFE TRUST: Whatever comes in, we have to make space. MCKENZIE: It takes years to rehabilitate and reintroduce the orphans into the wild. For the keepers, it's not just a 9 to 5 job. EDWIN LUSICHI, CHIEF KEEPER: But after working with these elephants, it's no longer just a job. It is from inside your heart, the love that you have for these animals. MCKENZIE: Every three hours, day and night, the keepers mix fortified soy milk for the elephants. It costs $900 a month to care for each orphan, so the elephants have to earn their keep. With a slap of sunscreen to protect their sensitive skin, the babies go on parade. They slush and slide for the throngs of tourists who see the fun, but not the heartbreak. MCKENZIE: So, they hope to lead these infants through their most fragile stage. It could take years before Sala joins a family of wild elephants. In the care of her human family, she might just make it. David McKenzie, CNN, Nairobi, Kenya. (END VIDEO) Impact Your World .

    "input": "(CNN) -- The future of video gaming is bright, according to four industry visionaries who spoke at a recent gaming event. Kellee Santiago, Ken Levine, Paul Barrett and Mark DeLoura were part of a panel discussion at the opening of a new Smithsonian exhibit,Â The Art of Video Games.Â Each has been successful in the gaming business and has great hope for what's to come. Barrett, the senior creative director for BioWare-Mythic, said people who are going to make games in the future are playing them right now. He describes this time in those gaming lives as their Golden Age. \"What's interesting about my Golden Age is it is where I learned my prejudices about what games I liked and I don't like,\" Barrett said. \"That period defined my understanding of games so that when I had the chance to make games, those are the kinds of game I wanted to make.\" For the gamers of today, he said, \"The current Golden Age is pretty bloody good.\" Others on the panel said they were also driven to create games that reflected or expressed something they wanted to share with others. For Levine, the creative director of theÂ \"BioShock\"Â franchise, it is about creating worlds and telling stories that mean something in those worlds. He related a story about the creation ofÂ \"BioShock,\"Â where players can save or sacrifice young girls, known as Little Sisters, to gain power. In the beginning of the creative process, the little girls were sea slugs. \"In order for the story to be meaningful, we had to create empathy between the player and the thing they were making a decision about,\" Levine said. \"That took a while for that to come about. The actual choice became simple -- what do you want to do with this little girl?\" Santiago and DeLoura hope future game designers go beyond what games are about today and challenge themselves and the industry about what gaming could be. DeLoura, the vice president of technology at THQ, wants the constraints of today's design to seem archaic to those who are just getting started and hopes for more diversity. \"The games that break down (the conventional) mentality is what does it for me,\" he said. \"For us pioneers up here, one of the things I would like to challenge us to do is to reach out into communities you don't expect games to come from and really pull those out and get them shared with the broader community.\" Santiago, co-founder and president of thatgamecompany, echoed that sentiment of opening up new ideas for games of the future. She is also a partner in IndieFund, which helps independent game developers reach and maintain financial independence. \"My biggest hope is that the people who will be making games, what those people look like, completely changes,\" she said. \"We're going to see new types of stories and new types of experiences. With greater technology and distribution channels, it has flipped a switch for people and they say, 'Oh, I could do that too!'\" Levine added that with additional venues for gaming like app stores and Kickstarter, future game designers don't have to be driven to find funding to produce games anymore. He said that without that financial pressure, creativity goes up. \"Games were my companion as a kid,\" Levine said. \"It didn't shut my world down. It opened my world up.\" Barrett said there is a whole new wave of people who want to make games that are fearless, expect success and have wide ranging views. He said those future designers have one goal in mind. \"They don't want to make games that are art. They want to make games that are awesome.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Spongy red balls wait in a queue, separating two teams wired to smack their opponent. Within seconds, the players dip and dive like dolphins until one player stands alone, relishing in victory. An adult plays in a dodge ball league organized by the . City of Sparks Parks and Recreation in Nevada. It's the classic game of dodge ball, but these aren't fifth-graders during PE class in Sparks, Nevada. The childhood sport of dodge ball made a comeback four years ago in this bedroom community among adults in their 20s and 30s -- and even a few players who reached retirement. Now, hundreds of working professionals, doctors, lawyers and teachers congregate at the local recreation center for a dose of dodge ball on Sunday nights. \"I think a lot of it goes back to trying to stay young,\" said Tony Pehle, recreation supervisor in Sparks, who started the dodge ball program after being inspired by the 2004 Ben Stiller movie \"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story.\" \"They might be adults, but they still like to play and have fun.\" Has Peter Pan syndrome come to stay? From playing dodge ball to jumping double Dutch and competing in rock-paper-scissors, adult men and women, from urban nests to rural towns, are reveling in games and activities once thought to be child's play. The 2009 World Yo-Yo Contest in Orlando, Florida, this weekend (August 13)  is all grown up, attracting more than 150 adult competitors, who can showcase dizzying tricks with the flick of a finger. Later in the month, hundreds of adults outfitted in pirate and animal costumes will race their homebuilt vehicles for Oregon's annual Portland Adult Soapbox Derby, a crafty activity that began for youths in the 1930s. \"Once a year, I get to build something for the kid in me,\" says Jason Hogue, a 41-year-old carpenter, who has participated in the race for eight years. Last year, he constructed a car shaped like a hammerhead shark. \"We get to use our creativity and get excited with our friends.\" Whether they're done to seek refuge from the daily grind or to provide nostalgia for youthful days -- or they're a product of what some experts say is a generation that can't grow up -- these juvenile pastimes are getting more popular. For example, adult viewership of the Nickelodeon show \"SpongeBob SquarePants\" swelled by 51 percent from 1999 to 2009, officials say. The World Adult Kickball Association, one of the largest kickball organizations, has spread its tentacles to 33 states as well a soldier division in Iraq. WAKA Kickball began as a casual game between a few young single friends in their 20s in Washington, D.C. Now, the games appeal to tens of thousands of adults, many of them yuppies wanting a quick escape from the stresses of their first 401(k), mortgage and job. \"I played soccer growing up, and I like competition,\" says avid kickball player Marlon LeWinter, 28, of New York City. LeWinter, a public relations executive, usually plays the position of center with a bunch of producers, writers and analysts in their late 20s. They named their team Chipwich Nation after they scarfed down the cookies-and-ice cream treat at a bar after a game one night. \"Sometimes when it's [the score] two to one in a kickball came, I get the jitters,\" he says. The economic bind also creates a favorable environment for adults to latch onto simple children's games and sports. With players who are trapped in a world of layoffs and job freezes, these adult leagues, contests and tournaments are the equivalent of sandbox time for children. They can make new friends and go for a beer after the game. These activities are also budget-friendly, costing less than $100 to join for several months of play -- much less than a golf club membership. Since the recession, Duncan Toys, one of the biggest yo-yo manufacturers in the United States, has seen sales spike. A company official noticed many of the adults who purchased yo-yos tried to get the same models they owned as kids. \"Nowadays, everything is taken so seriously that people revert to something like playing with a yo-yo,\" says Mike McBride, a 34-year-old multimedia designer who picked up the activity shortly after college. McBride, who will compete in the Orlando World Yo-Yo contest, says the activity helps him relieve stress. \"There's no pressure.\" In 2006, Christopher Noxon, in his book \"Rejuvenile,\" explored why adults fancy childhood pursuits like kickball, cartoons and cupcakes. Beginning with Generation X adults in the 1990s, the group began to shift from the norms of the hierarchal corporate ladder, and the age of marriage began to steadily climb. Soon, juvenile activities that had been regarded as silly became hip. Quirky became cool, and more organized teams, groups and competitions for playground sports and childlike hobbies emerged. \"Our whole idea of adulthood has changed,\" says Noxon. \"We value flexibility and creativity, and these are things kids are good at. It's brought us back to what we had as children.\" But it isn't just the younger generations that clutch leftovers from their youth or become interested in child-like activities. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s still collect roomfuls of model train sets, romanticizing the days when the only way to travel was by choo-choo. Women in their 40s acquire American Girl dolls that stir fond memories of reading the novels during childhood. Psychology experts say it shouldn't be a surprise that the affinity for childhood hobbies and activities extends across generations. After all, Americans have long had an obsession with youth. To be young is associated with being fun, vibrant and active. In the Internet age, finding one's inner child has never been easier, with the proliferation of social networks such as Facebook or Web sites like Meetup.com, where users can create groups and meeting times for activities. On the site, groups of adults organize scavenger hunts in Atlanta, Georgia, and action figure discussions in New York City. \"This is a generation of people who are far less homogenous and more niche-oriented,\" says Judith Sills, a clinical psychologist who works with young adults. \"They can bond around their quirky differences. Ten years ago, you couldn't have easily found another kickball player, even if you wanted to play.\"",

    "input": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN)  -- Ann Nixon Cooper sits back in her dining room chair, her eyes closed tight and her lips clenched, when asked if she will attend Barack Obama's inauguration in January. Ann Nixon Cooper was born in 1902, a time when women and black people were denied the right to vote. \"I could go and maybe would go, but I'm not looking forward to it,\" says the 106-year-old former socialite. What if Obama came to her house and asked her in person to attend? Cooper perks up and a big smile spreads across her face. \"Oh, yes, of course I'm ready to go!\" It's been a whirlwind ever since Obama mentioned the African-American centenarian in his victory speech Tuesday night. Throngs of media -- from the BBC to a Japanese station to national news outlets -- have descended on her Atlanta house. Strangers have stopped by too. She's taking it all in stride. She stayed up later than usual, until about 3 a.m., after Obama's speech and the phone began ringing off the hook. She had been tipped off by the Obama campaign that he'd say something. \"Somebody told him what to say and what to do and he followed through,\" she says.  Watch \"I'd be proud to meet him as anybody else\" Â» . Cooper -- who was born during a time when women and black people couldn't vote -- fully understands the significance of Obama's victory. \"Things are changing, changing, changing, and I look for more change now that it's the first black president in victory of faith over fear,\" she says. \"Don't you know, that's quite something to be proud of.\" What would she tell Obama if she ever meets him? \"I wouldn't have anything special to say about Obama. I enjoyed listening to him, but that's all,\" she says. \"I would be proud to meet him as anyone else.\" She and her late husband, prominent dentist Dr. Albert Cooper, raised four children in her house. The home was a center of Atlanta's black society and the scene of many parties. She knew Martin Luther King Jr. when he was just a boy and was close with his mother. She sometimes refers to Obama as \"that young man.\" In his victory speech, Obama praised Cooper's fight. The president-elect had learned of her story two weeks earlier after CNN profiled her when she went to the polls to vote early. Obama called her soon afterward.  Watch Obama talk about Cooper in his victory speech Â» . \"This election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations,\" Obama told the tens of thousands of supporters who had gathered in Chicago on Tuesday night. \"But one that's on my mind tonight is about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She's a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing -- Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old. \"She was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn't vote for two reasons -- because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin. \"And tonight, I think about all that she's seen throughout her century in America -- the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can't, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.\" Cooper watched Obama's speech from her home. \"Yeah, I knew he was talking about me -- I had been told that he would be saying these things.\"  See images of Cooper's early voting extravaganza Â» . She added that her late husband \"would be elated\" a black man will be president. \"Yeah, he'd be so tickled to death,\" she said. \"We looked forward to changes. Everybody looked forward to a better life.\" One of her grandsons, Albert B. Cooper, said the family has been overwhelmed with pride since Tuesday. \"It was a bigger honor than you could ever imagine to be mentioned in Obama's speech. For her to be used as an example of the strength -- and all the changes that have gone on within the black community -- is stunning. We were touched and proud and I can't come up with the words,\" he says. \"It's an amazing thing.\" Ann Cooper has called Atlanta home since the 1920s. She co-founded a Girls Club for African-American youth and taught community residents to read in a tutoring program at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached. Celebrities, including the late singer Nat King Cole, often dropped in to visit. One time many years ago, a young student from Morehouse College stopped to visit. He spoke of dreams to become a filmmaker. That man, it turns out, was Spike Lee. \"It's been a house with a heap of living going on in it,\" Cooper said. Born in 1902 in Shelbyville, Tennessee, Cooper danced the electric slide up until the age of 103. She has recently slowed down after suffering several heart attacks and a fractured hip. On a typical day, Cooper spends hours watching television in her wood-paneled sitting room. Her favorite shows are \"The Price is Right,\" \"Oprah\" and \"Dancing with the Stars.\" Three of Cooper's four children have died; her surviving daughter is 83. She has 14 grandchildren living and many great-grandchildren and great-great-grandchildren. When CNN first interviewed her in October, she said she only had one thing left to see in this world. \"I ain't got time to die 'cause I've got to see a black president,\" she said, giggling with excitement. \"I've got to see that.\" Now, she says, \"I would be very proud if I could just meet and shake his hand.\"",

It was flying the flag of Gibraltar. The Dignity was carrying crew and 16 passengers -- physicians from Britain, Germany and Cyprus and human rights activists from the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement  -- who were trying to reach Gaza through an Israeli blockade of the territory. Also on board was former U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney. Penhaul said an Israeli patrol boat shined its spotlight on the Dignity, and then it and another patrol boat shadowed the Dignity for about a half hour before the collision. One patrol boat \"very severely rammed\" the Dignity, Penhaul said. The captain of the Dignity told Penhaul he received no warning. Only after the collision did the Israelis come on the radio to say they struck the boat because they believed it was involved in terrorist activities, the captain said. But Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor denied that and said the patrol boat had warned the vessel not to proceed to Gaza because it is a closed military area. Palmor said there was no response to the radio message, and the vessel then tried to out-maneuver the Israeli patrol boat, leading to the collision.  Watch Penhaul describe the boat damage Â» . The captain and crew said their vessel was struck intentionally, Penhaul said, but Palmor called those allegations \"absurd.\" \"There is no intention on the part of the Israeli navy to ram anybody,\" Palmor said. \"I would call it ramming. Let's just call it as it is,\" McKinney said after the boat docked in Lebanon. \"Our boat was rammed three times, twice in the front and one on the side.  Watch Cynthia McKinney discuss the collision Â» . \"Our mission was a peaceful mission to deliver medical supplies and our mission was thwarted by the Israelis -- the aggressiveness of the Israeli military,\" she said. The incident occurred in international waters about 90 miles off Gaza. Israel controls the waters off Gaza's coast and routinely blocks ships from coming into the Palestinian territory as part of an ongoing blockade that also applies to the Israel-Gaza border. Human rights groups have expressed concern about the blockade on Gaza, which has restricted the delivery of emergency aid and fuel supplies. Tuesday's collision was so severe, Penhaul said, that the passengers were ordered to put on their life vests and be ready to get in lifeboats. The Dignity began taking on water, but the crew managed to pump it out of the hull long enough for the boat to reach shore. \"It could have ended with people drowning if they hit us more square on,\" Dignity's captain, Denis Healey, said. \"It could have gone down in minutes.\" Palmor said the vessel refused assistance after the incident. The boat was carrying boxes of relief supplies, volunteers and journalists to Gaza, the Palestinian territory that has been subject to an intense Israeli bombing campaign since Saturday. Israel Tuesday lambasted McKinney -- the Green Party's 2008 candidate for the U.S. presidency and a former Democratic congresswoman from Georgia -- for taking part in the maritime mission. In a written statement, the Consulate General of Israel to the Southeast, based in Atlanta, Georgia, said McKinney \"has taken it upon herself to commit an act of provocation,\" endangering herself and the crew. \"We regret that during this time of crisis, while Israel is battling with the terrorist organization of Hamas and defending its citizens, that we are forced to deal with Ms. McKinney's irresponsible behavior,\" the statement read. The trip was the Free Gaza Solidarity Movement's sixth in as many months. Israel launched airstrikes against Gaza on Saturday in what Defense Minister Ehud Barak called an \"all-out war\" against the Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has ruled the territory since 2007. The Israeli military says its goal is to stop a recent barrage of rocket fire from Gaza into southern Israel.  Watch the chaos in Gaza and Israel Â» . The Palestinian death toll has topped 375, most of them Hamas militants, Palestinian medical sources said Tuesday. At least 60 civilians have been killed in Gaza, U.N. officials said. Hamas has continued to fire rockets at southern Israeli towns since the airstrikes began, Israel says. Six Israelis have been killed -- five of them civilians. Hamas has vowed to defend Gaza in the face of what it calls continued Israeli aggression. Each side blames the other for violating an Egyptian-brokered cease-fire, which formally expired December 19, but had been weakening for months.",

Creator Cathy Guisewite says she is ending the comic strip in October in order to spend more time with her family and pursue new creative ventures. The strip, which has run in some 1,400 newspapers, will run for the last time October 3, according to Universal Uclick, the syndicate. \"After almost 34 years of meeting newspaper deadlines,\" Guisewite said in a statement, \"I'm facing some personal deadlines whose requirements simply exceed my ability to procrastinate any longer: an 18-year-old daughter who needs a full-time mom to help her through her last year of high school and beyond ... beloved parents I want to be able to visit more often ... and a creative biological clock, which is urging me to try something else while I can.\" Cathy has been a hit with people who appreciated her comic neuroses, which often resulted in her trademark exclamation, \"AACK!\" As a result, she has been featured on everything from refrigerator magnets and coffee mugs to calendars and T-shirts. The titles of Cathy book collections reveal the character's obsession with weight, food, shopping and shoes: Abs of Steel, Buns of Cinnamon (1997); Shoes: Chocolate for the Feet (2000); and Wake Me Up When I'm a Size 5 (1985). An early collection from 1982 had a cover showing Cathy on her sofa, surrounded by her TV, snacks, and a teddy bear. The title: Another Saturday Night of Wild and Reckless Abandon. Guisewite began the strip when she started working in the mid-1970s, said Lee Salem, president and editor of Universal Uclick. \"Cathy Guisewite would send her mother drawings describing the latest trauma in her life as a single young career woman, and in response, her mother urged her to try her hand at a comic strip,\" Salem said in a statement. \"The day the submission arrived in our office, we had a contract out to Cathy in return mail. Seven months later, the strip began in newspapers.\" It wasn't an immediate hit, but Cathy steadily gained popularity and eventually appeared in hundreds of newspapers. There are more than 30 Cathy books. \"Cathy has held a distinguished place in newspaper comic sections for more than three decades because of Cathy Guisewite's skillful hand,\" said Salem. \"Cathy balances truth and humor and speaks to women in a way that few comics have ever attempted. She is a cultural icon and her strip has earned its place among the modern greats.\"",

One of the pictures in the French magazine Paris Match that has stirred controversy. The latest edition of Paris Match includes photos of the Taliban fighters and their commander, \"Farouki,\" wearing French uniforms, helmets and using French assault rifles and walkie-talkies. Farouki, aged 30-35, claims in the accompanying story to have led his group in the August 18 ambush which killed 10 French troops and injured a further 21 in the Sarobi District, 40 miles east of Kabul. It was the French army's single highest death toll in 25 years. He said the area was \"our territory\" and the attack was a \"legitimate\" part of its defense. Farouki said it did not need a lot of planning, with the French soldiers only spotted a short time before the assault. He said the soldiers had died for \"[George W.] Bush's\" cause and that if France did not return the rest of its troops home they would all be killed. Farouki said they would continue fighting till the last man. See more on Paris Match's Web site . French Defense Minister Herve Morin accused the magazine of helping the Taliban. \"Should we be doing the Taliban's promotion for them?\" he asked in the French daily newspaper Liberation. Joel Le Pahun, father of one of the killed soldiers, told the newspaper the pictures were \"despicable.\" Green MP Daniel Cohn-Bendit called them \"voyeurism.\" However, Paris Match editor Laurent Valdiguie defended the publication, saying it was \"legitimate\" given the importance of the story. The story's author, Eric de LavarÃ¨ne, said only he and photographer VÃ©ronique de Viguerie met the group and he asked his questions via their \"fixer.\"",

    "input": "Metropolis, Illinois (CNN) -- Superman will not be saving Lois Lane this time, but the residents of Metropolis are hopeful his fans will. Metropolis, Illinois wants a companion statue for Superman, but the economy may block its efforts. The villain is the economy. Despite being about $70,000 shy of the funding needed to cast a figure in the image of the fictional \"Daily Planet\" reporter, this town of 6,000 residents says it's going forward with a ground breaking. Metropolis wants its Lois Lane statue. There are no skyscrapers here. If you search the local telephone book you won't find any familiar names. There's no Lex Luthor or Perry White. The closest Jimmy Olsen lives in Aledo, Illinois. If you call the nearby nuclear plant and ask about kryptonite they won't take you seriously. Most days of the year you can walk about town without seeing anyone in a cape or leotard. Very little about Metropolis, Illinois, resembles the metroplex made famous in \"Action Comics,\" except for the constant presence of Superman. His statue stands 15-feet tall outside the Massac County Courthouse and 50 yards away is the county justice center. In 1972, DC Comics, the current owner of the character, declared the town the official home for Superman. Since then, it's residents have fashioned a monument, a museum, and an annual festival around the superhero. \"We've had groups from as far away as Japan and Australia,\" said Karla Ogle, one of the festival organizers. \"There's a family that comes every year from Canada.\" And each year Noel Neill is honored. She's the original Lois Lane. Neill starred opposite George Reeves in the 1950s \"Adventures of Superman\" television series and it's her image the local chamber of commerce wants to immortalize in a statue. The town first came up with the idea of a companion statue for Superman in 2005. A lot has changed since then, primarily the economy. \"We've been affected pretty heavily because most of our revenue comes from the casino,\" said Mayor Billy McDaniel. The Harrah's Casino is the closest thing this little burgh has to a tall building. \"Their revenue has been down as much as 30 percent,\" noted McDaniel. And the Metropolis budget is not bulletproof either. The town has not been replacing some workers as they retire, because of the lower tax receipts. What about the prospects for Lois Lane? \"If there's any money out there we're going to find it,\" said the mayor. Metropolis has agreed to foot half the statue's bill, if the Illinois Board of Tourism provides a matching grant. Private donations have raised only $9,000 in four years, not even enough to pay for the monument's base. \"They were good initially, but slowed down to a trickle,\" said Clyde Wills with the Metropolis Chamber of Commerce. \"We're committed to the project,\" despite the economy. The city plans to break ground for the statue on June 11, during the opening night of their annual Superman festival, even though the state is months away from a decision on their grant request. Lois Lane's fate, like in most issues of the comic, is \"to be continued ...\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A Buffalo, New York, man is due in court Thursday to face charges that he raped a 13-year-old runaway police say he held prisoner in his home for six months. Michael J. Abdallah, 26, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree rape, unlawful imprisonment and custodial interference. Thursday's hearing will determine if the case should be referred to a grand jury. Buffalo police said that Abdallah kept the girl in his home from July through December 2009, behind dead-bolt locks and doors with no doorknobs. A criminal complaint alleges that Abdallah had sex with her more than 100 times. Police spokesman Michael DeGeorge said Abdallah also forced the girl to baby-sit his year-old son. Abdallah is unmarried, and the identity of the child's mother is not known. Police would not say how the girl left Adbdallah's home, why there was a delay from December to February for his arrest or where the teenager is now. Abdallah was arrested Friday when police raided his home on a child-abuse allegation, Buffalo media reported. The next day, Buffalo City Court Judge James A.W. McLeod set bond at $250,000 in an arraignment at which Abdallah represented himself. He has since been provided with a court-appointed attorney, according to media reports. But friends of the defendant told the Buffalo News that he was nothing more than a Good Samaritan trying to help a runaway girl he met in a Buffalo park. \"Everybody has had their moments, but Mike is not a monster. As long as I've known Mike, he's always been kindhearted to me. If he could help you, he will help you,\" Alicia Bellaus, 20, who grew up next door to Abdallah's relatives, told the paper. \"Mike always had her calling to someone, supposedly her aunt, to say she was doing OK. From what I knew, her aunt or her mom knew where she was staying,\" said Bellaus, who previously had a romantic relationship with Abdallah. \"To look at her, she is very developed physically, and you would think that she is older than 13.\" Bellaus said the girl told her she was 17 or 18 and denied having sex with Abdallah, and that she also said she did not want to go home to her mother, the News said. Police told the News that the family filed several missing person reports after the girl disappeared in July. And an unnamed law enforcement official told the paper that Abdallah was a manipulative drug dealer who \"lured her in\" and kept her trapped physically and psychologically. CNN, however, could not confirm that official's view. George Kimble, who lives four doors from Abdallah, said he was surprised when he learned about the accusations. \"This is a street where everyone knows everyone,\" said Kimble, who remembered Abdallah moving in about a year-and-a-half ago. \"I never recall him with a 13-year-old girl.\" Kimble said Abdallah was seldom home, and their brief conversations were limited to Abdallah's two dogs. Other neighbors told Kimble the house had a steady stream of visitors on any given day.",

    "input": "(CNN)  -- For almost a week, tens of thousands of Iranians have taken to the streets in daily protests -- handkerchiefs shielding their faces from the pungency of tear gas, fists punching the air, and chants of \"Down with the dictator\" echoing against buildings. Moussovi supporters rally Wednesday in Tehran, Iran. Released by Fars News Agency of Iran. The massive outpouring is a result of a disputed presidential election that the protesters think coronated the incumbent hard-liner, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, over their candidate, Mir Hossain Moussavi. Context can help put their grievances into perspective: . Q. The Iran that we know today is the result of the Islamic Revolution. What is it? A. The Islamic Revolution is the name given to the Iranian revolution of 1979, when the ruling U.S.-supported monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile.  See timeline of recent Iranian history Â» . The country held a national referendum to become an Islamic republic and approve a new constitution. The constitution was a hybrid of democracy and unelected religious leadership. It appointed Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini -- the leader of the revolution -- the supreme leader of the country. Before he died in 1989, he made it known that he wanted Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to succeed him. Q. Is it true that the ultimate power in Iran lies with Khamenei? A. Yes. The supreme leader has the final say in all important matters of the country, such as ties with foreign nations or Iran's nuclear aspirations. He appoints the Guardian Council -- the country's election authority. He also appoints key posts in the intelligence services and the armed forces, including the powerful Revolutionary Guard. Additionally, he confirms the president's election. In theory, the supreme leader is appointed by a body of clerics whom voters elect. But in practice, this body -- the Assembly of Experts -- has answered to the supreme leader. Khamenei, 70, was appointed supreme leader for life in 1989. Q. What is the Guardian Council, which has been in the news, saying it will recount some of the votes in the disputed election? A. The unelected Guardian Council is the second-most influential body in Iran politics. It consists of six theologians whom the supreme leader picks and six jurists nominated by the judiciary and approved by parliament. The council approves all candidates running for office in the country, and verifies election results. It vetoes bills passed by the parliament if they do not conform to the constitution and Islamic law. In the present crisis, opposition leader Moussavi has had to take his grievance to the Guardian Council. It has agreed to some vote recounts.  See galleries of protests in Iran Â» . Q. So, how much power does the president wield? A. It depends on how nicely he plays with the Guardian Council. The president is elected by direct vote to a four-year term, for a maximum of two terms. He is responsible for economic policy and social programs, but most of the larger decisions are made by the supreme leader. In theory, his powers are second to the supreme leader's. But in practice, he is often hamstrung by the Guardian Council. The Guardian Council has worked with hard-liner Ahmadinejad, a 53-year-old former mayor of Tehran who was elected in 2005. But it thwarted reform attempts by his predecessor, Mohammad Khatami. Q. What is the Revolutionary Guard, who said they will take legal action against pro-Moussavi Web sites? A. The guard was initially created to protect the leaders of the revolution. But over the years, it has broadened its scope. Today, it is directly under the control of the supreme leader and enforces the governments' Islamic codes and morality . With more than 200,000 members, it is tasked with overseeing the country's crucial interests, including guarding its oil fields and missile arsenals. Q. What is the Basij, who are said to be behind most of the violence against opposition supporters? A. The Basij is a volunteer paramilitary force that takes orders from the Revolutionary Guard. It plays the role of de facto morality police and is often summoned to crack down on protests. It is unknown how large the force is, though estimates are in the millions. Q. What evidence is there of ballot fraud? A. There are no concrete examples of fraud, because independent monitors did not oversee polling in Iran, but the circumstantial evidence is persuasive. The government had initially said it would take three days to verify the ballots after Election Day on June 12. But the election authority proclaimed Ahmadinejad the winner two hours after the polls closed. At the same time, the interior ministry said that 85 percent of the country's 46 million eligible voters had cast ballots -- a record turnout. To many, so many ballots could not have been hand-counted in such a short time. Also, the published results showed that Ahmadinejad won even in his opponents' strongholds, including Moussavi's hometown of ethnic Azeri Turks. \"This is the equivalent of Barack Obama losing the African-American vote to John McCain in 2008,\" said Karim Sajadpour of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Furthermore, Moussavi went into the election with massive support from the country's youth, who were unhappy with the faltering economy and an unemployment rate that tops 30 percent by some accounts. The youth make up 60 percent of Iran's population of 70 million. Q. Is it true that Ahmadinejad still enjoys widespread support? A. Yes. Ahmadinejad is popular across Iran's rural areas and among the Basij militia. He presents himself as a populist and a fighter. He has paid attention to the families of the bloody Iran-Iraq war, offering special preferences to veterans' children in university admissions. As president, his hardline approach has won him support among the Guardian Council. He has earned a reputation internationally as a fundamentalist for his Holocaust denials, calls to annihilate Israel, and cat-and-mouse games with the United States and the United Nations over Iran's nuclear activities. Many in the establishment view him as someone who does not cower to big-footing by the West. Q. Why, then, do some analysts think the vote was manipulated? A. Some experts say that even if it is likely that Ahmadinejad won the election, it is unlikely he could have won by the margin the government is claiming -- 62.63 percent of the vote. Time magazine's Joe Klein explains it this way: \"It is entirely possible that Ahmadinejad would have won anyway, but narrowly, perhaps with less than 50 percent of the vote, setting up a runoff election he might have lost as the other candidates united against him. It is possible that his government, perhaps acting in concert with supreme leader Ayatullah Ali Khamenei, decided to take no chances.\" Q. Why is Iran's population so young? A. After the revolution, the leaders encouraged early marriage and large families, rewarding families with cars and television sets for each additional child. During the country's devastating eight-year war with Iraq, which began in 1980, the regime continued encouraging population growth, because more children meant more future soldiers. It is those children who are now coming of age. Q. Why did Iran summon Switzerland's ambassador to complain about perceived U.S. involvement in Iran's election process? A. The United States cut diplomatic ties with Iran following the hostage crisis in 1979, when students in support of the Islamic Revolution took 52 Americans hostage and held them for 444 days. Q. Is this movement a challenge to the Islamic republic? A. The demonstrators say their demand is simple: Hold fresh elections. They say they are not out to challenge the Islamic regime.  Watch protests Wednesday in Tehran Â» . Furthermore, Moussavi is an unlikely man for the job. Though the 67-year-old former prime minister is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy as prime minister during the Iran-Iraq war, he also was a hard-liner whom the Economist described as a \"firm radical.\" He, like most Iranians in power, does not believe in the existence of Israel. He defended the taking of the American hostages in 1979. He was part of a regime that regularly executed dissidents. And as late as April, he opposed suspending the country's nuclear-enrichment program but said it would not be diverted to weapons use. The protests have exposed a fissure in the country, however, with tens of thousands of Ahmadinejad backers taking to the streets in a show of force of their own. Q. Are the current protests likely to continue? A. For now, the government seems to be allowing the populace to vent pent-up frustrations. But it also is gradually cracking down, such as blocking Web sites and banning international journalists from filming the rallies. The demonstrations have so far been focused on urban areas. Should the populace in rural areas take up the call for reform, the government might step in quickly to quash the protests, analysts say.  See map of demonstration sites in Tehran Â» . Q. Is this the first time Iranians have risen up in mass protests against the regime? A. No. Iran has twice seen public calls for reform in recent years: in 1999, after the closing of a reformist newspaper, and after parliamentary elections in 2000. On both occasions, the Revolutionary Guard descended on the streets after a few days and crushed the movements. Q. So, can true reform come to Iran? A. It is possible. Ahmadinejad's predecessor, Khatami, was elected president in 1997 by a landslide, despite being a reformer. During his two terms, he championed freedom of expression, tried to mend diplomatic relations, and supported a free market. He was, however, hamstrung at every step by stiff resistance from the supreme leader and the Guardian Council.

    "input": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Laura Hathaway initially had no regrets after getting a tattoo on her lower back when she was 21. But now, 10 years later, she wants it gone. Tattoo removal is more painful than the original tattoo, patient Laura Hathaway says. The pharmaceutical sales representative from Atlanta, Georgia, says it doesn't fit in with her current lifestyle as the mother of a 2-year-old boy who just started to talk. \"The other day I bent over and he said, 'What's that?' and it just confirms why I'm having it removed.\" Dr. Scott Karempelis of Atlanta Dermatology Associates is performing a multitreatment laser procedure that will gradually erase Hathaway's tattoo with little or no scarring. The process is painful, expensive and time-consuming. Karempelis says that in spite of the drawbacks, \"business is booming.\" He and three other dermatologists in his office see more than 30 patients a day who want tattoos removed by laser.  Watch Hathaway's tattoo beginning to disappear Â» . The American Academy of Dermatology reports tattoo regret is common in the United States. Among a group of 18- to 50-year-olds surveyed in 2004, 24 percent reported having a tattoo and 17 percent of those considered getting their tattoo removed. Karempelis uses a state-of-the-art laser that targets the pigment in the tattoo. \"It goes through the skin without damaging it and hits the pigment depending on which wavelength and which color you have, and it blows it into small pieces.\" The tattoo ink is then reabsorbed into the body through the lymphatic system. The process must be completed over several sessions in order to protect the skin from damage. Hathaway expects to go through 10 sessions several weeks apart, each lasting less than a minute. She admits it's a lot more painful than getting the original tattoo. \"It's prickly,\" describes Hathaway. \"It feels like a bee is sitting on your back stinging time and time again. Afterwards, the pain does go away and you're a little sore for a few hours.\" Patients with bigger tattoos are sometimes given the option to use a topical anesthetic, but Karempelis points out that it adds to the cost. Like other dermatologists, he charges by the square inch for the laser treatment. By the time Hathaway's done, she expects to pay more than $2,200. There's no guarantee that she won't have a scar. \"Scarring is your major risk,\" says Karempelis. \"Almost everyone gets a little bit of discoloration, a little lighter, a little darker for a while. But in most cases if you wait a year, you cannot see where it was done initially.\" Certain tattoo colors, such as green, yellow and purple, are harder to remove, Karempelis says, especially for people with darker skin. Some parts of the body also pose a challenge. \"The farthest away from the heart are hardest to treat, so the ankles are the toughest,\" Karempelis says. He predicts his business will increase in the future, after a new type of tattoo ink hits the market. Freedom-2 is a microencapsulated dye. It's designed to be easily removed by a single laser treatment. \"The laser would hit that pigment and it would completely dissolve immediately. ... You wouldn't need repetitive treatments,\" the doctor says. But until the ink becomes available, Karempelis expects to see a variety of patients going through long sessions to remove reminders of their past. He says the most popular tattoos to be removed in his office are the names of old boyfriends and former spouses. In Hathaway's case, her tattoo of a flower didn't fit the image she wants to portray. She says she got the tattoo long before low-rise pants became popular. \"It's just something I wanted to be private and now it's not.\" E-mail to a friend .

    "input": "(CNN)  -- Brazilian World Cup hero Ronaldo says he is to retire from football at the end of next year. Ronaldo, who was a member of the Brazil squad which won the 1994 World Cup and scored twice in the final in 2002 as they beat Germany, has been playing for Corinthians in his native country. The 33-year-old told the club's official Web site www.corinthians.com that he would see out his two-year contract which ends in 2011 before hanging up his boots. \"I renewed for two more years and those will be the last ones,\" he said after morning training on Monday. Ronaldo has enjoyed a glittering international career with Brazil, scoring 62 goals in 97 appearances, setting a new World Cup record with his 15th in the 2006 finals where they were knocked out in the quarterfinals. Despite his advancing years and with a string of injuries behind him, Ronaldo still holds out hopes of taking part in this year's finals in South Africa but admitted he faces a tough task in persuading Brazil coach Dunga to pick him. \"It's a thing that can still happen to me,\" he believes. But for now he has targeted South America's Libertadores Cup, having already helped Corinthians to the Paulista Championship in Brazil, scoring 12 goals in 20 appearances to show he still retains his scoring touch. \"I am determined. I want to give my best, have fun and I hope to finish by winning the Libertadores,\" he said. When he finally retires, Ronaldo will be remembered as one of the greatest footballers of all time, with a scoring rate of approaching a goal a game while plying his trade with top European club sides PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona, Real Madrid and both Internazionale and AC Milan. He is a three-time FIFA World Footballer of the Year. Ronaldo began his career in Brazil with Cruzeiro and returned to turn out for Corinthians after another serious knee injury while playing for Milan appeared to signal his playing days were over. But he has defied his critics, and after initially training with Flamengo, settled on the Corinthians and is set to act as an ambassador at the Parque San Jorge after he quits.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Prague has not been nicknamed \"Zlata Praha\" or \"Golden Prague\" for no good reason. The well-deserved eponym is a tribute to this city that mixes architecture, history, art and beauty like no other. While not forgetting its more somber communist past, Prague has been one of the first East European cities to get a luxurious makeover. Designer shopping malls, exclusive restaurants and trendy nightclubs abound. But it is the mystical atmosphere of a Prague of past eras that leaves many visitors craving to come back. Largely untouched by the ravages of WWII, Prague is arguably the only European city with so many century-old buildings left intact for people to enjoy. All more impressive than the others, these are the historical sites you should not miss in Prague. Wenceslas Square: In 1348, King Charles IV of Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) founded the town of Prague. The King built several open areas for markets, including Wenceslas Square, previously known as the Horse Market. Named after Saint Wenceslas, the patron saint of the Czech state, the square is the largest in the city and was at the center of much of Prague's history, including the Nazi occupation, the Soviet invasion, and the Velvet Revolution. In 1969, Prague student Jan Palach set himself on fire in Wenceslas Square to protest the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. And in 1989, during the Velvet Revolution that overthrew the Communist regime, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators gathered here to protest. Today the square has become one of the trendiest and busiest in the country. Lining Wenceslas Square are fashion stores, cafes, bars and kiosks. Above the square is Prague's Museum of Natural History, which was shot at by Communist troops when they mistook it for the Parliament building. Prague Castle: Kings, Roman Emperors and Presidents have lived in this legendary castle that overlooks the city. The castle is the largest medieval castle complex in Europe and arguable Prague's prime tourist attraction. First built in the 9th century, Prague Castle has survived wars, fires and opposing political powers. The castle complex consists of the Saint Virtus Cathedral, viewing towers, a monastery, museums and art galleries. The Czech crown jewels are also held here. After Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993, the castle became the seat of the President of the new Czech Republic. Charles Bridge: This magnificent 14th century gothic bridge over Prague's Vltava river is lined with a series of large stone statues that represent important religious figures and icons. Its construction started in 1357 under King Charles IV and finished in the beginning of the 15th century. Until the 19th century, the bridge was the only way to cross between the Old Town and adjacent areas, also known as the \"Lesser Town.\" During the day, thousands of people traverse the bridge to watch the views of the city and enjoy the numerous street performers. Dancing House: A masterpiece of modern architecture, Dancing House was named after dancing duo Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Dancing House is also sometimes nicknamed \"Drunk House\" for its wavy curves. The building was constructed between 1992 and 1996 by Czech architect Vlado Milunc and world-renowned Canadian architect Frank Gehry. The top floor houses one of the city's most exclusive restaurants, Celeste. Old Town Square: Located in the heart of the Old Town, this square included Prague's gothic Church of Our Lady before Tyn, the main church of this part of the city since the 14th century. The church's towers are 80 meters high and topped by small golden spires. Another fixture of the Old Town Square is the baroque-style St. Nicholas Church. In the center of the square is a large statue of Jan Hus, a Catholic priest who was burned at the stake by the Roman Catholic Church for heresy in 1415. But the most popular attraction for visitors of the square is the famous Astronomical Clock. Astronomical Clock: Built in 1410, the Astronomical Clock still functions and provides accurate data on a number of astrological events, such as the relative positions of the sun, moon and major planets. Each hour, the clock bells and a series of moving wooden puppets come out. Below the Astronomical Clock are 12 medallions with the signs of the zodiac, added by painter Josef Manes in 1865. Prague Cathedral: Saint Vitus's Cathedral is another one of Prague's Gothic masterpieces. The Cathedral, set in the walls of the Prague Castle, was commissioned by King Charles IV and work on it began in 1344. It took nearly six centuries to complete. Today it is the seat of the Archbishop of Prague and contains the tombs of many of the Bohemian Kings. The interior features stained-glass windows from different eras. One of the cathedral's chambers was used to crown several Kings and it is said the room can only be opened with seven golden keys given to different members of parliament. Vyshehrad: The old fortress of Vyshehrad and its surrounding parks is the place where the city of Prague was originally founded and around which the city was built. It is a great place to get a sense of the history of the city. Its thick walls house the National Cemetery, where many of Prague's most illustrious citizens are buried, including Czech composer AntonÃ­n Leopold Dvorak and writer Karel Capek.",

    "input": "Editor's note: This is part of a series of reports CNN.com is featuring from an upcoming, six-hour television event, \"God's Warriors,\" hosted by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour. Madeleine Albright: \"In order to effectively conduct foreign policy today, you have to understand the role of God and religion.\" WASHINGTON (CNN) -- As U.S. secretary of state under former President Clinton, Madeleine Albright invested long hours in the Middle East peace process. She wrote about the relationship between politics and religion in her 2006 book, \"The Mighty and the Almighty.\" CNN producer Jen Christensen recently spoke with Albright for \"God's Warriors.\" Here is an edited portion of their conversation: . CNN: Growing up I was told that in polite conversation you never talk about two things: politics and religion; however, our documentary, \"God's Warriors,\" is going to do just that. Part of the problem though in looking at these issues is the loaded quality of the language. Even our starting point. We essentially had to create a term, \"God's Warriors,\" as the traditional term \"fundamentalism\" seemed problematic. Did you encounter the same problem when you were writing \"The Mighty and the Almighty\"? Watch the making of the TV special \"God's Warriors\" Â» . Albright: Well, I think it's a very hard term, fundamentalism, as you're obviously finding. Historically, it's a term that described Christians who believed that everything that was in the Bible was exactly so. But now it's been used to describe everybody in the three Abrahamic religions who is conservative or reactionary. One of the things that I found in writing my book [was] that fundamentalism was a term that I was having trouble with. Because it has gotten ascribed to it a lot of negative associations. CNN: In your book, you argue for a better understanding of religion in the U.S. foreign policy arena. Isn't that a revolutionary idea for this generation of diplomats trained more in the realist school of foreign policy? Albright: As a practitioner of foreign policy, I certainly come from the generation of people who used to say, \"X problem is complicated enough. Let's not bring God and religion into it.\" But through my being in office, and as I explored the subject much further in writing \"The Mighty and the Almighty,\" I really thought that the opposite is true. In order to effectively conduct foreign policy today, you have to understand the role of God and religion. ... My sense is that we don't fully understand, because one, it's pretty complicated, and two, everyone in the U.S. believes in a separation of church and state, so you think, \"Well, if we don't believe in the convergence of church and state, then perhaps we shouldn't worry about the role of religion.\" I think we do that now at our own peril. Religion is instrumental in shaping ideas and policies. It's an essential part of everyday life in a whole host of countries. And obviously it plays a role in how these countries behave, so we need to know what the religious influence is. CNN: We interviewed a human rights lawyer in Jerusalem, Danny Seidemann, who has on occasion helped peace negotiators in Israel get ready for talks. He said one of the main problems with President Clinton's Camp David [talks] was that a lot of the preparation was done by \"yuppies in Ramallah, yuppies in Tel Aviv and yuppies in the Beltway.\" And that they didn't really understand the religious people who in the end would have to buy into the results of the negotiations in order for them to succeed. He said without that understanding the agreement was doomed. Albright: Well, I can't say I fully agree with him. I've talked about what I think we did right and what we did wrong at Camp David. I think that there was a mistake made, which was not understanding how difficult the issue of Jerusalem and the holy places would be. If Jerusalem was just a real estate issue, we would have resolved it a long time ago. But because the parties believe that God gave them that piece of land, then obviously there's another presence in the room that we needed to take into account. I disagree with the statement because President Clinton knew a great deal about the religious background. I had the honor of working for two democratic presidents, President Carter and President Clinton, and they're both very religious and both very knowledgeable about the religious backgrounds of the Middle East. CNN: The fate of Jerusalem seems to be a particularly tricky issue. Albright: Anybody that can really solve that issue is a Solomon. With this being holy to all three of the Abrahamic religions, it's very difficult. And religion, rather than bringing people together on this, is driving them apart, which ... I don't think [is] what is intended. It's so interesting; we're talking about the whole issue of sovereignty here. Because the parties both believed that God gave them that little piece of land, we started playing with a term, which was that it belonged to God. Divine sovereignty. Anybody who's been to Jerusalem can see why it is so complicated. Physically, religious holy places are completely intertwined, one on top of the other. So in many ways, there's great appeal to saying it belongs to God, and then trying to figure out how it [is] administered, maybe through some international group of some kind. CNN: Is Jerusalem a place where we could have this kind of utopian area, where the three faiths could all live peacefully together? Albright: Well, ideally, though it certainly doesn't seem that way at this point. And while the United States or the [Mideast] Quartet needs to play a key role in what to do with Jerusalem, ultimately the parties there in Israel are the ones that have to make the hard decisions. If there ever is a will to do this, just think about the incredible opportunities here. People would be able to learn about all three of these great religions in the same place. They'd be able to see how they relate to each other. It does sound a little utopian, well, very utopian at this point, but Jerusalem is an incredible place. I found the first time I went to Jerusalem, my initial reaction was, people are arguing over all this all the time, it made me think, well, there can't be a God, why would God put up with this? And then I had the total opposite reaction. One that stays with me, which is that there are so many holy places and symbols there, and all anybody talks about is their relationship to those symbols and to God, and therefore the power of God must be so strong there. I just think that it would be much better if people could figure out ... how to agree about it. CNN: So, therefore, how to figure out the fate Jerusalem is the perfect example of why we need to include religious understanding in our foreign policy. Albright: Definitely. I am not a theologian, and I have not turned into a religious mystic, but I am a practical problem solver. So I'm looking at religion from the perspective of how knowledge about what people believe in can be useful in terms of trying to resolve the most serious disputes. I think one of the major problems is that here in the United States, particularly, there is very little understanding of Islam. We all act as if Islam is a monolithic religion and that all Muslims live in the Middle East. The bottom line is most Muslims in the world don't live in the Middle East. They live in Indonesia, or Malaysia, or India, um, Pakistan. Second, there are a number of different sects within Islam. Now I think more people understand the difference between Shia and Sunni, but that is just the beginning. We really do not know anything about it. I think it behooves our diplomats to be very knowledgeable about religion when they are sent to a country. They obviously learn the language and the history [and] culture; they also need to learn about the religion, too. CNN: What impact has the religious right had on politics? Albright: Everybody ... has [an] impact on politics, that's what democracy is about. I think they have more of an impact on domestic than foreign policy. CNN: But you mention in your book that some gave you a hard time when you were the U.S. representative to the U.N. Albright: Well, the extremists really are very nervous in terms of the question of sovereignty and the creation of an international organization, which they misinterpret to be world government, which it actually is not. And then there are the even more extreme views -- you know, some of them saw the secretary-general as the antichrist and that I was consorting with the devil. These are the people who are afraid of the U.N., because they think it has black helicopters that will swoop down and steal your lawn furniture. And then there are some people who don't like the U.N. because it's full of foreigners, which frankly can't be helped. So you have a wide range of critics there. E-mail to a friend .",

    "input": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN) -- Security forces in Iran on Thursday confronted thousands of protesting Iranians across the city, first at a cemetery and later at a prayer venue and near a government building, witnesses and news reports said. Mourners gather around the grave of Neda Agh-Soltan in Beheshte Zahra Cemetery. Clashes erupted at the cemetery as two of Iran's main opposition leaders tried to join the several thousand people at a memorial for the slain woman who became the symbol of Iran's post-election violence, witnesses said. The gathering was banned, but participants ignored the government strictures. However, security forces barred opposition leaders Mir Hossein Moussavi and Mehdi Karrubi from the gravesite of Neda Agha-Soltan, the 26-year-old woman shot in election protests on June 20, witnesses and news reports said. More than 3,000 people were gathered at Agha-Soltan's grave, a witness said. Mourners arrived on the religiously significant 40th day after the fatal shooting in Tehran. For Iranians, a predominantly Shiite Muslim population, the 40th day after a death marks the last official day of mourning. At the cemetery, security forces used tear gas to clear the area of demonstrators and mourners. A witness said riot police and Basij militia were at the scene, but the confrontations with people in the crowd involved the militia.  Watch a report on the memorial clashes Â» . The witness spotted instances of the baton-wielding militia charging the gathering, and said as many as nine beatings were seen. Other people  appeared to have been beaten as they ran from police, the witness said. One of the mourners had a bloody head and one woman said she was struck on the back of the neck. One security force member sustained some sort of injury to the head and was bloodied. It is unclear exactly how that person was injured. A confrontation between women protesters and police also was seen. The women shouted, \"Don't beat up our young people. You, our Muslim brothers. It is a shame to beat up our young people.\" The crowd chanted \"Ya Hossein, Mir Hossein,\" the first a reference to the revered Shiite imam and the second a reference to Moussavi. Then there were more chants of \"Allah wa Akbar,\" or God is great. iReport.com: Share your photos, video, stories . Despite reports of arrests, none were seen on the mourning day. U.S. State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said using force to \"break up a group of people who were trying to exercise an important ritual in Islam, the mourning after 40 days,\" was \"particularly disturbing.\" \"We stand by the Iranian people who are exercising their universal right to self-expression and demonstrating peacefully,\" Kelly said. Iran's state-run news agency, IRNA, reported that the mourners \"disrupted the order\" in the city and damaged public and private property and that security forces were merely trying to control the \"illegal activity\" of the group. IRNA also reported that Tehran residents in the area were angry with the constant protests and wanted a stronger response from the security forces. Another witness told CNN that police directing traffic at the cemetery were helpful and friendly, in stark contrast to the riot police and Revolutionary Guard members who were at the gravesites. From the cemetery, the mourners arrived at the Mossalla, a building under construction that is expected to be the main venue of Tehran's Friday prayers, witnesses said. A couple thousand people demonstrated and police worked to disperse the crowd -- which also was defying a ban on such a gathering. \"The police tried to discourage drivers from driving the main highway that would lead to central Tehran, but very few listened,\" one witness said. \"Soldiers standing along the streets flashed the peace sign back at the honking cars with large smiles on their faces. It was obvious the soldiers and police forces were with the people.\" Thousands also marched and chanted along a prominent thoroughfare called Vali Asr Street, chanting slogans such as \"Death to the dictator\" amid the honking of car horns, a witness said. Amateur video posted Thursday on several Web sites and submitted to CNN's iReport showed a security officer swinging a baton at a demonstrator. CNN cannot confirm the circumstances of the images. Protesters gathered near the Interior Ministry building and trash cans were set ablaze, another witness said. Police on motorcycles attempted to break up the gathering, and one security officer was seen wielding a gun. Moussavi was the chief challenger of incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in the June presidential elections, which the government said Ahmadinejad won in a landslide but many Iranians think was rigged. Moussavi had said on his Web site that he and fellow reform candidate Karrubi would commemorate Agha-Soltan's death with her mother at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery. At the cemetery, a witness said a car identical to a vehicle belonging to Moussavi drove through the area. It was not clear if Moussavi was in the vehicle, but people were sitting atop and around the car as if to protect it. The car left the scene. In the days after the June vote, thousands of Iranians took to the streets to protest the results. The government cracked down. Hundreds were detained in prison, among them 50 \"political figures\" accused of playing key roles in the street demonstrations that turned violent, Iranian media reported Wednesday. Among those still reportedly detained is Shahpour Kazemi, Moussavi's brother-in-law, according to Moussavi's wife. Others include Behzad Nabavi, a Moussavi ally, and Mostafa Tajzadeh, who served under Iranian President Mohammad Khatami -- a Moussavi supporter -- the Iranian Labor News Agency reported Tuesday.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Despite defense criticisms of what it called a \"shameful\" leading question about whether Drew Peterson tried to intimidate a neighbor, a judge ruled Thursday that the former Chicago-area police officer's murder trial can proceed. Five witnesses took the stand in Joliet on Thursday, but not before lawyers from both sides argued about whether a mistrial should be ordered, thus bringing the entire case back to square one. This debate followed testimony Wednesday by Thomas Pontarelli, a Bolingbrook, Illinois, neighbor of Peterson's ex-wife Kathleen Savio and one of those who found her dead in a dry, clean bathtub on March 1, 2004. Pontarelli testified Savio had asked him to put a lock on her bedroom door and also that Peterson had once challenged him about the front door locks at Savio's house being changed, which Pontarelli insisted he didn't do. The night of March 1, he said Peterson -- a police officer in Bolingbrook who was barred from seeing Savio by a protective order -- called the Pontarelli house to say a locksmith was coming to get in his ex-wife's house. After the door was unlocked, Pontarelli, some of his family members and Peterson came across Savio's body, with no rug or towel nearby, in an upstairs bathroom. Later, prosecutor Kathy Patton brought up the time Peterson questioned Pontarelli about whether he'd changed the locks of Savio's front door, asking him, \"Did there come a time when you felt intimidated by him?\" \"Yes,\" Pontarelli responded. \"We had a conversation. He accused me of changing the locks on the front door. I (said) I didn't, but I got his message ... I found a .38 bullet out on the driveway.\" Catch up on the Peterson case in 3 minutes . After this statement, defense lawyer Steven Greenberg objected and subsequently Judge Edward Burmila asked the jurors and the witness to leave the courtroom. On Thursday, Greenberg argued for a mistrial, saying, \"(Prosecutors) are going to try and continue ... to put in evidence that people were fearful of Mr. Peterson ... So far, we have a jury that thinks everybody's afraid of Mr. Peterson. How is that fair to Mr. Peterson?\" Calling the state's question leading and unfair, the defense lawyer added that prosecutors were acting as if \"the rules of evidence don't apply to them,\" which he called \"shameful.\" Prosecutor Chris Koch, in response, said it was \"absurd\" to suggest the state was \"trying to mislead this jury.\" The judge ruled the question and response was inadmissible, later instructing jurors to ignore it and any reference to a bullet. But he also said the trial should continue and that the jury could consider the rest of Pontarelli's testimony. With this issue settled, the trial resumed with the testimony of Louis Oleskiewicz, the paramedic who saw Salvo \"down in the bathtub\" with no pulse. He spoke about her hair being matted down and skin feeling cold and \"waxy.\" Oleskiewicz said he didn't see any towels to suggest Savio might have been taking a bath, questioning whether a blue towel shown in a picture from the scene was actually there that night. A locksmith, Robert Akin, took the stand next to discuss being called -- with a call straight to his cell phone, even though he was not on call for his shop that night -- and unlocking the front door of Savio's house, with Peterson standing next to him flashlight in hand. Three Bolingbrook firefighters later testified about their experience at the Savio house that night, noting the presence of several people, including Peterson. Two of them said Peterson, who was in uniform, asked them to be respectful of the scene because it was his ex-wife. Testimony will resume Friday and, after a three-day weekend, pick up on Tuesday. The entire trial is expected to last about four weeks. Peterson's letter to the media . Peterson, now 58, was married to Savio in 2001 when he had an affair with then-17-year-old Stacy Kales, who later became Peterson's fourth wife. He has been called a suspect in her 2007 disappearance, though he's never been charged and she has never been found. Savio and Drew Peterson filed for divorce that October, and their relationship remained contentious for the next several years. Bolingbrook police records indicate officers were called to Savio's home 18 times to intervene in domestic fights from 2002 to 2004. Drew Peterson had Savio arrested twice for domestic violence, though she was found not guilty in both cases. A judge in March 2002 granted Savio a protection order from her ex-husband, prohibiting him from being near her, entering her home or taking out their children except for two brief weekly visits. Savio had claimed that months after that order was issued, Peterson held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her inside her home. On February 27, 2004, Peterson picked up his two sons from Savio's home, spending the next two days with them. Prosecutors believe that he entered her home again early on February 29 and killed Savio. At the time of her death, which authorities initially treated as an accident, a court was mulling how the couple's marital assets would be divided, and Savio was set to receive part of Peterson's pension and other support. During opening statements Tuesday, one of Peterson's lawyers argued that their client spent his career protecting the public and that murder accusations are groundless. \"Kathy slipped, fell, hit her head in a household accident, and drowned. Case closed,\" said attorney Joel Brodsky. InSession's Michael Christian in Joliet contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Oscar-winning filmmaker Roman Polanski has been arrested in Switzerland on a decades-old arrest warrant stemming from a sex charge in California, Swiss police said Sunday. Roman Polanski attends a film premiere in Paris, France, in June 2009. Polanski, 76, was taken into custody trying to enter Switzerland on Saturday, Zurich police said. A spokesman for the Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was arrested upon arrival at the airport. He has lived in France for decades to avoid being arrested if he enters the United States and declined to appear in person to collect his Academy Award for Best Director for \"The Pianist\" in 2003. The director pleaded guilty in 1977 to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, acknowledging he had sex with a 13-year-old girl. But he fled the United States before he could be sentenced, and U.S. authorities have had a warrant for his arrest since 1978.  Watch what happens now for Polanski Â» . Polanski was nominated for best director Oscars for \"Tess\" and \"Chinatown,\" and for best writing for \"Rosemary's Baby,\" which he also directed. He was en route to the Zurich Film Festival, which is holding a Polanski tribute this year, when he was arrested by Swiss authorities, the festival said. A provisional arrest warrant was issued last week out of Los Angeles, California, after authorities learned Polanski was going to be in Switzerland, Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, told CNN on Sunday. There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years, but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to attend hearings. Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who \"drugged and raped a 13-year-old child.\" The Swiss Justice Ministry said Polanski was put \"in provisional detention.\" But whether he can be extradited to the United States \"can be established only after the extradition process judicially has been finalised,\" a ministry spokesman said in an e-mail. \"It is possible to appeal at the federal penal court of justice against an arrest warrant in view to extradition as well as against an extradition decision,\" the spokesman wrote. \"Their decisions can be taken further to the federal court of justice.\" Gibbons said the extradition process will be determined in Switzerland, but said authorities are ready to move forward with Polanski's sentencing process, depending on what happens in Zurich. Polanski was accused of plying a 13-year-old girl with champagne and a sliver of a quaalude tablet and performing various sex acts, including intercourse, with her during a photo shoot at actor Jack Nicholson's house. He was 43 at the time. Nicholson was not at home, but his girlfriend at the time, actress Anjelica Huston, was. According to a probation report contained in the filing, Huston described the victim as \"sullen.\" \"She appeared to be one of those kind of little chicks between -- could be any age up to 25. She did not look like a 13-year-old scared little thing,\" Huston said. She added that Polanski did not strike her as the type of man who would force himself on a young girl. \"I don't think he's a bad man,\" she said in the report. \"I think he's an unhappy man.\" Polanski pleaded guilty to a single count of having unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor. There have been repeated attempts to settle the case over the years, but the sticking point has always been Polanski's refusal to return to attend hearings. Prosecutors have consistently argued that it would be a miscarriage of justice to allow a man to go free who \"drugged and raped a 13-year-old child.\" Polanski's lawyers tried earlier this year to have the charges thrown out, but a Los Angeles judge rejected the request. In doing so, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Peter Espinoza left the door open to reconsider his ruling if Polanski shows up in court. Espinoza also appeared to acknowledge problems with the way Polanski's case was handled years ago. According to court documents, Polanski, his lawyer and the prosecutor thought they'd worked out a deal that would spare Polanski from prison and let the young victim avoid a public trial. But the original judge in the case, who is now dead, first sent the director to maximum-security prison for 42 days while he underwent psychological testing. Then, on the eve of his sentencing, the judge told attorneys he was inclined to send Polanski back to prison for another 48 days. Polanski fled the United States for France, where he was born. In the February hearing, Espinoza mentioned a documentary film that depicts backroom deals between prosecutors and a media-obsessed judge who was worried his public image would suffer if he didn't send Polanski to prison. \"It's hard to contest some of the behavior in the documentary was misconduct,\" said Espinoza. But he declined to dismiss the case entirely. Legal experts said such a ruling would have been extremely rare. Polanski's victim is among those calling for the case to be tossed out. Samantha Geimer filed court papers in January saying, \"I am no longer a 13-year-old child. I have dealt with the difficulties of being a victim, have surmounted and surpassed them with one exception. \"Every time this case is brought to the attention of the Court, great focus is made of me, my family, my mother and others. That attention is not pleasant to experience and is not worth maintaining over some irrelevant legal nicety, the continuation of the case.\" Geimer, now 45, married and a mother of three, sued Polanski and received an undisclosed settlement. She long ago came forward and made her identity public -- mainly, she said, because she was disturbed by how the criminal case had been handled. Following Espinoza's ruling earlier this year, Geimer's lawyer, Larry Silver, said he was disappointed and that Espinoza \"did not get to the merits and consider the clear proof of both judicial and prosecutorial corruption.\" He argued in court that had \"Mr. Polanski been treated fairly\" his client would not still be suffering because of publicity almost 32 years after the crime. Polanski's arrest Saturday came two days after one of his wife's killers died. The director's pregnant wife, actress Sharon Tate, and four others were butchered by members of the Manson \"family\" in August 1969. Polanski was filming in Europe at the time. By her own admission, Susan Atkins held the eight-months-pregnant Tate down as she pleaded for mercy, stabbing the 26-year-old actress 16 times. CNN's Frederik Pleitgen, Brooke Bowman, Karan Olson and Ann O'Neill contributed to this report.",

She shouted a few words at Mandelson, who rushed inside the building, before walking away. London's Metropolitan Police said it did not arrest the woman because \"no complaint has been made as yet.\" Plane Stupid, a group that opposes airport expansion and aviation-related climate change, identified the protester as Leila Deen, 29. \"It's not right that someone like Peter Mandelson can stand up and talk about being green. The only thing green about Peter Mandelson is the slime coursing through his veins,\" said Deen, who said she works at a poverty charity. Deen disguised the custard in a disposable coffee cup with a lid. \"It was a grave decision that I had to take to highlight this, but we cannot have people like Peter Mandelson standing by and being applauded for his actions on climate change when he's agreed to the third runway and bullied others into that,\" she added. Mandelson indicated that Deen failed to make her point. \"She was so busy throwing what seemed like green soup or something in my face that she failed to tell me what the protest was about,\" he said. \"Thankfully, it wasn't paint and I've come through it intact.\" Mandelson said he wanted to get on with his meeting \"and not bother too much with adolescent protests.\"  Watch Mandelson get \"slimed\" Â» . It was the second high-profile action this week by Plane Stupid, which has become known for headline-grabbing stunts. Tuesday, nine of the group's protesters broke into the grounds of Aberdeen Airport in Scotland and delayed flights for several hours in a demonstration over expansion. The British government voted in January to approve a controversial third runway at Heathrow, saying it will increase airport capacity and is essential for British business. The government has promised noise and emission levels will actually be reduced as Britain meets European Union targets. Heathrow currently operates at 99 percent capacity. The runway's construction would involve razing areas around the airport, including an entire village and parts of two other towns. Opponents say emission levels will actually increase under the plans.",

The OTS announced Friday that it was taking over the $32 billion IndyMac and transferring control to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The OTS pointed the finger directly at Schumer for the failure, accusing him of sparking a bank run by releasing a letter that \"expressed concerns about IndyMac's viability.\"  Watch what's next for IndyMac Â» . \"In the following 11 business days, depositors withdrew more than $1.3 billion from their accounts,\" the OTS said in a statement announcing the California-based lender's takeover on Friday. The statement included a quote from OTS Director John Reich saying, \"Although this institution was already in distress, I am troubled by any interference in the regulatory process.\" Schumer, a member of the Senate Banking Committee, chairman of Congress' Joint Economic Committee and the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, rejected any suggestions of responsibility for IndyMac's collapse . \"OTS ought to stop pointing false fingers of blame and start doing its job to protect the future of the banking system, so that there won't be other IndyMacs,\" he said. Schumer's June 26 letter said he was \"concerned that IndyMac's financial deterioration poses significant risks to both taxpayers and borrowers.\" In a Sunday news conference, he said everything in his letter was already known to the public. \"IndyMac was one of the most poorly run and reckless of all the banks,\" he said. \"It was a spinoff from the old Countrywide, and like Countrywide, it did all kinds of profligate activities that it never should have. Both IndyMac and Countrywide helped cause the housing crisis we're now in.\" The embattled Countrywide Financial Corp. was recently purchased by Bank of America. Schumer argued that the \"breadth and depth\" of the problems at IndyMac were \"apparent for years, and they accelerated in the last six months.\" But OTS, he said, \"was asleep at the switch and allowed things to happen without restraint. \"And now they are doing what the Bush administration always does: Blame the fire on the person who calls 911.\" The White House had no immediate response. Schumer said OTS is \"known as a weak regulator,\" and added, \"my job was to try and toughen them up and that's what I tried to do.\" IndyMac, with assets of $32 billion and deposits of $19 billion, is the fifth bank to fail this year. Between 2005 and 2007, only three banks failed. And in the past 15 years, the FDIC has taken over 127 banks with combined assets of $22 billion, according to FDIC records. IndyMac will reopen Monday with a new charter and a new name -- IndyMac Federal Bank.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Former Haitian first lady Mirlande Manigat will face popular musician Michel Martelly in the second round of presidential elections in Haiti, the electoral commission announced Thursday. The government-backed candidate, Jude Celestin, was eliminated from the race. The announcement followed pressure from the United States and others on President Rene Preval to honor recommendations from the Organization of American States regarding the runoff election. In early December, the electoral council announced that Manigat had won but lacked the majority of votes needed for an outright victory. Initial results put her in a runoff with Celestin, a protege of the president. The third-place candidate, Martelly, claimed he had won more votes than Celestin and a review of results by an Organization of American States team supported that contention. That review suggested that Martelly earned a spot in the runoff. When the initial results were announced, Haitians responded by charging fraud and burning cars, tires and Celestin's campaign headquarters in Port-au-Prince. With Thursday's decision, the council accepted the findings of the review. The vote is set for March 20. Final results will not be known until April 16, officials say. U.S. Ambassador to Haiti Kenneth Merten told reporters in Washington that Thursday was \"a good day in Haiti.\" Merten called for all of Haiti's politicians and people to remain \"calm and peaceful\" in the run-up to the second round of voting. The attempts to resolve the political turmoil come as the toll in the nation's cholera outbreak surged past 4,000, the public health ministry said. Nearly 216,000 people have been sickened and 4,131 had died as of January 28, according to the latest report posted by the ministry. Struck by a massive earthquake a year ago, Haiti has been struggling to recover. Its troubles were compounded first by cholera and then by the controversy surrounding the November 28 presidential election. CNN's Moni Basu contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Concepcion, Chile (CNN)  -- We couldn't have traveled farther to see the same thing. We were returning to the United States from Haiti -- where every turn continues to unveil another human tragedy even six weeks after the January 12 earthquake -- when we were redirected to Chile. An 8.8-magnitude quake had struck the area around Chile's capital, a seismic event 800 times more powerful than the one in Haiti. Getting there was half the story. We took off from Miami, Florida, knowing the airport in Santiago was closed, so our aim was to get as close as we could. That set off a journey that would last 48 hours. We flew to Panama, Lima, Sao Paolo, Buenos Aires and Bariloche, then began a very long drive through the Patagonia region of Argentina, into Chile and north into the earthquake zone. We were followed by an enormous full moon and skimpy clouds that danced along the skyline. This region seems too lovely to be the scene of any tragedy. Its tall green mountains peaked with whitecaps and broad lakes give way to fields and sparkly beaches. South America had summer vacation until it was interrupted by this disaster. And it is, in a word, a disaster. Haiti, with its death toll and great suffering, sets the bar very high right now for what you can call a tragedy. But there is nothing inconsequential about hundreds of people dying, crushed in their own homes or swept away by a frantic sea. Chile has had very powerful earthquakes before and is a modern and wealthy place compared with Haiti. But as we drove up through Ozoro, Las Violetas, Los Angeles and other lovely farming towns, we saw chunks of roadway and roofs fallen away, fractured bridges, people camped in tents among their cows. Every Chilean we spoke to talked about how the previous earthquakes had pushed anyone with means to rebuild their homes or find new ones designed to withstand strong shaking. People here know what to do. But the sight of military convoys and ambulances told the story of what 8.8 can do. An ambulance driver in Los Angeles said there had been dozens of aftershocks, many powerful enough to add to the rising toll of injured and dead in towns without many large structures. They were overwhelmed and being dispatched to Concepcion, where a large population and tall structures meant more severe injuries. There, we found looting and people walking the streets in search of water and gas. The largest buildings were missing entire walls, and glass had shorn off the sides. A light cold drizzle was getting everyone wet. The vacation period means a lot of young people are out being mochileros (backpackers) and are separated from families by distance and downed phone lines. They have heard the stories of beach towns swept away and houses upended and are hitching rides at gas stations, hoping to find a way to reunite. The aftershocks are like a rising tide here, a clear sign that this is not over, that the damage is not done. The farm stands and cottages of the back roads are crooked and empty; the city centers look abandoned and on the brink. This country is not crying out for international assistance in the way Haiti did. It was prepared and has coping resources. This is a place that sends rescue workers to other countries because they're so good at it. Yet its natural beauty and efficiency are not enough to diminish what connects these folks to Haiti -- that the people waiting for buses beside the blackberry fields along Panamericana Ruta 5 are running scared.",

    "input": "New York (CNN) -- Just as it has happened for more than a century as the old year ticks toward history, a large crowd will gather Friday night in New York's Times Square to mark the old and the new with the descent of an iconic ball. The dazzling crystal ball will begin its 70-foot descent precisely at 11:59 p.m. ET to the chants of New Year's Eve revelers counting down the final seconds of 2010, according to the event's official website. Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Medal of Honor recipient Staff Sgt. Salvatore A. Giunta will push a button to start the ball toward 2011. Weighing in at 11,875 pounds with a diameter of 12 feet, the sparkling sphere is covered with 2,668 triangular crystals and is powered by 32,256 LED lights. By mixing red, blue, green and white light elements, the ball's lighting system is capable of producing a kaleidoscopic array of 16 million hues and colors, and billions of patterns, the event's website says. Each giant New Year's numeral making up \"2-0-1-1\" will stand 7 feet high and the numerals will use a total 453 9-watt LED bulbs. As in the past three years, the numerals were designed to be more energy efficient, as Duracell set up a lab in which visitors rode stationary bikes to provide the stored battery power that will light the numbers on the ball Friday night. More than one ton of confetti will be released at midnight, with personal individual wishes written in more than 25 languages, a tradition from the past three years. Times Square has served as one of the most popular sites of New Year's festivities since 1904, though the New Year's Eve ball made its inaugural drop down the flagpole at One Times Square in 1907. That first ball, built with iron and wood, featured one hundred light bulbs and was designed by Jacob Starr, a young immigrant metalworker. The New Year's Eve ball has beamed and dropped every year since with the exceptions of 1942 and 1943, when the United States was embroiled in World War II and New York City observed a citywide \"dim-out\" to cut energy costs. According to New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, this New Year's Eve celebration, like years in the past, is a product of a lot of hard work and planning by many people. \"We don't ever take it for granted,\" Kelly said. \"The situation changes somewhat, we have sort of a core plan but we always add to it or change it -- we don't want to get stuck in a rut where we simply take a plan off the shelf.\" iReport: Times Square readies for the crowds . As in previous years, security will be tight. Times Square will be closed to traffic at approximately 3 p.m. on Friday. Backpacks and alcohol are prohibited at the event and party-goers can expect a beefed-up police presence, according to the statement from the New York Police Department. \"It is a big complex operation and you know you always breathe a sigh of relief when it's over,\" Kelly said.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Nineteen former patients at a Denver, Colorado, hospital have tested positive for hepatitis C, federal prosecutors said Thursday as they announced new charges against a former hospital employee accused of exposing the patients to the virus. A hospital worker is accused of injecting herself and using unclean syringes for patients. Prosecutors charged Kristen Diane Parker with 21 counts of tampering with a consumer product and another 21 counts of obtaining a controlled substance by deceit or subterfuge, according to an indictment. Parker, 26, had previously faced three federal counts from earlier this month. Parker, who worked as a surgical technician at Rose Medical Center in Denver, is accused of injecting herself with syringes that held patients' pain medication Fentanyl, then replacing the pain medication in the syringes with saline, according to a statement from the office of the U.S. attorney for Colorado. In a statement to police during the investigation, Parker said, \"I can't take back what I did, but I will have to live with it for the rest of my life, and so does everyone else.\" Parker's attorney did not return a call from CNN on Thursday. Authorities said Parker knew she had hepatitis C, a contagious liver disease. Hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Parker believes she contracted the virus through using heroin and sharing needles with other users while she lived in New Jersey in 2008, authorities said. According to an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Food and Drug Administration, Rose Medical Center knew Parker tested positive for hepatitis C. She was counseled on how to limit her exposure to patients. Parker worked at Rose Medical Center from October 2008 to April 2009, said Jeff Dorschner, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney for Colorado. Parker's employment was terminated after she failed a hospital-ordered drug test, said Leslie Teegarden, spokeswoman for Rose Medical Center. The tests were ordered after co-workers reported \"suspicious behavior,\"  Teegarden said Thursday. Rose Medical Center contacted about 4,700 patients who may have been exposed to the virus, according to a statement on the center's Web site. Of those patients, 3,540 have been tested thus far, Teegarden said. She said the hospital plans to use tamper-resistant, pre-filled Fentanyl syringes to prevent intentional contaminations. Parker also worked at Northern Westchester Hospital in New York and Audubon Ambulatory Surgical Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Prosecutors have not charged her with any crimes related to her employment at the other two facilities. About 1,200 patients may have been exposed between May 4 and July 1 of this year, when Parker worked at Audubon, according to the center's Web site. As of last week, 545 of Audobon's former patients had been tested for the virus, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. One patient tested positive for hepatitis C, but that infection could not be linked to Parker, according to the department's Web site. Nearly 1,000 patients had been tested as of Thursday, said Audubon spokeswoman Amy Triandiflou. Details about what Parker may have done to expose Audubon patients to the virus are still sketchy, Triandiflou said. More than 2,700 patients could have been exposed at Northern Westchester Hospital, according to the hospital's Web site. The site did not indicate whether any infections had been detected. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. If Parker is convicted and if any one of the former patients suffers serious bodily injury because of her actions, she could face a maximum of 20 years in federal prison, prosecutors said. If she is convicted and if any one of the former patients dies as a result of the infection, she could be sentenced to life in prison, according to prosecutors. CNN's Jim Spellman contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Two's company, three's chaos in \"This Means War,\" a high-tech, high-octane gloss on the type of story we've seen a million times in sitcoms and screwball comedies. Taking his cue from Doug Liman's \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith,\" director McG aims for a kind of macho rom-com, a date movie that appeals to both men and women. The end product is slick, flashy and obnoxious. Reese Witherspoon has top billing, but rising stars Chris Pine and Tom Hardy call the shots as charmingly irresponsible CIA operatives FDR and Tuck. After an embarrassing fracas overseas, these best buds are assigned to office duty. And with homeland security very much on the back burner, it's not long before their thoughts turn to women ... or, as fate would have it, the same woman. Divorced dad Tuck meets Lauren through a dating agency. They hit it off. But within minutes of their first date, she bumps into FDR, a confirmed bachelor and ladies man. She calls him on his transparent lines, but he's persistent, and circumstances throw them back together even as she fixes up a second date with Tuck. (Lauren's a consumer products tester by trade, not someone who'd buy a car without taking it for a spin.) When they realize they're both chasing the same girl, the guys decide to let the lady make her choice -- without coming clean. Of course, neither can resist spying on the other's progress, despite a gentleman's agreement not to. In the movie's breeziest patches, the two hunks eavesdrop on Lauren as she compares their shortcomings with BFF Trish (an authentically abrasive Chelsea Handler). It might help if both men didn't come off so self-involved. We're meant to understand they love each other, as much as -- and probably more than -- Lauren, but that doesn't make their romantic trickery any easier to stomach. Hardy is a terrifically intense actor, who made a strong impression in \"Bronson\" and \"Warrior,\" and will soon be appearing as Bane in \"The Dark Knight Rises.\" But he doesn't make as much sense as a sensitive and domesticated superagent. Pine, on the other hand, is all too convincing as a smug and superficial womanizer. Witherspoon has the trickiest job of all, trying to retain our sympathies as she falls for both men. She might have pulled it off, except, it seems, \"Charlie's Angels\" director McG isn't interested in the emotional integrity of the character. He appeared far more invested in showing off the latest spyware gizmos and gadgets. In almost every respect, \"This Means War\" can be seen as the polar opposite of Witherspoon's last rom-com, \"How Do You Know.\" Most critics weren't kind to that picture (and it bombed in theaters), but, at the very least, it was an attempt to make sense of sex and romance in a real way. This crass and miscalculated movie might have been engineered by machines.",

President Obama called on both Israel and Hamas to make changes toward Mideast peace. He urged Israel to allow the flow of aid and commerce into the Palestinian territory. \"Our hearts go out to Palestinian civilians who are in need of immediate food, clean water and basic medical care,\" he said. The crossings should be opened with an \"appropriate monitoring,\" he added. Obama said Hamas leaders, for their part, must put an end to rocket attacks. He said he will send former Sen.

Earlier, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton arrived at her new office in the State Department, promising a renewed emphasis on candor and \"robust diplomacy\" as the primary means for advancing American interests around the world. America's new chief diplomat walked through the front doors of the State Department lobby shortly after 9 a.m. ET to thunderous applause from an overflow crowd of about 1,000 career diplomats and other department employees. \"I believe with all of my heart that this is a new era for America,\" Clinton told her colleagues. \"President Obama set the tone with his inaugural address. ... Robust diplomacy and effective development are the best long-term tools for securing America's future.\"  Watch Clinton greet her new employees Â» . In remarks that could be interpreted as a rebuke of the departed Bush administration, Clinton also said that the Obama administration would not \"tolerate the divisiveness and paralysis that has undermined our ability to get things done for America.\" Clinton also called for a new sense of candor and free exchange of ideas. She urged the country's diplomatic corps to think \"outside the proverbial box.\" \"There's nothing I welcome more than a good debate and the kind of dialogue that will make us better,\" she said. Clinton later attended an intelligence briefing and a meeting with members of the Diplomatic Security Service. She also walked through various State Department offices, including the operations center. Clinton also phoned international leaders, according to acting State Department spokesman Robert Wood. She is expected to call Asian leaders later Thursday. Clinton will also visit the U.S. Agency for International Development, which she praised \"for the work they've done on behalf of development through some very difficult years.\" During her confirmation hearing, Clinton pledged to secure more resources for the State Department and USAID, which has seen a lot of its development work fall to the Pentagon during the Bush administration.

    "input": "MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN) -- Gunmen shot and killed 17 patients and wounded two others in a drug rehabilitation center in northern Mexico late Wednesday, the mayor of Ciudad Juarez said Thursday. Police gather at the rehab facility where 17 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, late Wednesday. Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said authorities believe a rival drug gang attacked the men at the El Aviane rehab facility. \"At the very least, it was one organized crime group thinking that another group was operating in that place,\" Reyes told CNN. Wednesday night's shootings, he said, are similar to an attack at a drug facility in March that left 20 patients dead. A Mexican civic group said last week that Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, had the most slayings per capita in 2008 of any city in the world.  Watch scene at rehab center after shootings Â» . More than 1,420 people have been killed in Juarez this year, Reyes told CNN on Monday. About 1,600 people were killed in Juarez in 2008, Reyes said. The latest Juarez killings came on the same day that gunmen shot dead the No. 2 security official and three others in Michoacan, the home state of Mexican President Felipe Calderon. Jose Manuel Revuelta Lopez, the deputy public safety secretary of Mexico's Michoacan state, was killed in a shootout that also claimed the lives of two of his bodyguards and a bystander caught in the crossfire, said Jesus Humberto Adame Ortiz, spokesman for the state. Revuelta was leaving his office at 5:15 p.m. in the state capital, Morelia, when the shooting occurred, Adame said. An unprecedented wave of violence has washed over Mexico since Calderon declared war on drug cartels shortly after coming into office in December 2006. More than 11,000 people have since died, about 1,000 of them police. The offensive against the government has been especially fierce in Michoacan. In July, La Familia Michoacana drug cartel was accused of assaults in a half-dozen cities across the state and of torturing and killing 12 off-duty federal agents and dumping their bodies on a remote road. That violence was thought to have been retaliation for the arrest of a La Familia leader. In Juarez, much of the violence is being committed by the rival Sinaloa and Juarez drug cartels, which are fighting for lucrative routes into the United States as well as local street sales, Reyes said. The deportations of thousands of Mexicans who have served time in U.S. jails into Ciudad Juarez are adding a deadly ingredient to an already volatile state of security, he said. In the past 45 days, 10 percent of those killed in Juarez had been deported from the United States in the past two years, Reyes said. \"We don't have the statistics to know if they were criminals from the United States or not,\" he told CNN. \"We know they were deported from the U.S. Most of them come from U.S. jails. They end up in the city of Juarez, and that's a problem generated for us, but also for the United States.\" Most deportees are simply Mexicans who crossed the border illegally, but some hardened criminals get involved with the gangs, which have networks in the United States, Reyes said. According to a report released last week by the Mexican Citizens Council for Public Security watchdog group, Juarez had an estimated rate of 130 killings per 100,000 people. The city has a population of around 1.5 million. By comparison, the homicide rate in New Orleans, Louisiana, the deadliest city in the United States in 2008, was 64 homicides per 100,000 residents, based on preliminary FBI figures. CNN's Arthur Brice and Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.",

    "input": "London (CNN) -- Standard Chartered, a British banking giant, has paid $340 million to settle allegations it was involved in money laundering for Iranian clients. The settlement was reached with the New York State Department of Financial Services Tuesday, before a hearing due Wednesday. The hearing has now been adjourned. Standard Chartered -- which faced the loss of its U.S. banking license alongside fines for alleged breaches -- had pre-tax earnings of $6.76 billion in 2011, and the fine is \"easily manageable,\" according to a note by analyst Michael Symonds of Daiwa Capital Markets. Banks: Too big to prosecute? \"Reaching an early settlement means that StanChart avoids the potentially awkward hearing with the NYDFS.... and, critically, eliminates the immediate risk that the bank could lose its New York banking licence,\" Symonds said. However, investigations into the bank by other authorities including the Department of Justice and the Office of Foreign Assets Control continue, and \"this lone settlement does not draw a line through the matter,\" Symonds said. A statement from Standard Chartered said, \"a formal agreement containing the detailed terms of the settlement is expected to be concluded shortly.\" The group added that it \"continues to engage constructively with the other relevant U.S. authorities.\" What was Standard Chartered accused of? Standard Chartered was accused of helping Iran avoid American sanctions by concealing $250 billion worth of transactions over nearly 10 years, according to banking regulators in New York. More: Culture shift needed in banking? The New York State Department of Financial Services accused the London-based banking group of concealing 60,000 transactions with Iranian clients, including the Central Bank of Iran, from 2001 to 2010. The department says there is also evidence of similar schemes to conduct business with other U.S.-sanctioned countries such as Libya, Myanmar and Sudan. Why are there sanctions in place? The U.S. and its allies have increased economic sanctions against Iran during the past few years in an effort to deter the Islamic Republic from developing its nuclear capabilities. Iran has argued that its goal is to produce energy and medical isotopes, but U.S. officials say the Iranians are developing weapons. More: Age of irresponsibility in banks? Standard Chartered allegedly falsified business and official records to mask transactions with Iranian customers that were subject to U.S. economic sanctions, the New York State Department of Financial Services said. In exchange, the global banking group reaped \"hundreds of millions\" of dollars in fees, according to an order issued by the New York authorities. The regulators said the bank's actions left \"the U.S. financial system vulnerable to terrorists, weapons dealers, drug kingpins and corrupt regimes, and deprived law enforcement investigators of crucial information used to track all manner of criminal activity.\" How was Standard Chartered alleged to have violated the rules? The regulators said Standard Chartered had a well-established policy to \"repair\" documents in so-called U-Turn transactions, in which offshore money passes through the U.S. financial system on its way to other offshore accounts. Under federal law, banks are obligated to ensure that such transactions do not violate U.S. sanctions. But regulators say Standard Chartered's New York branch regularly manipulated wire transfers that would have identified Iranian customers in the U-Turn transactions. More: Banking ethics \"in question\" According to the order, an official in the bank's U.S. division warned top bank managers in London in 2006 that the bank could face \"serious criminal liability,\" according to internal emails. How was the warning received? The warning was allegedly rejected by the recipient, who regulators say responded by writing in an email: \"You f-ing Americans. Who are you to tell us, the rest of the world, that we are not going to deal with Iranians. [sic] \" According to the regulators, Standard Chartered's most senior management, \"designed and implemented an elaborate scheme by which to use its New York branch as a front for prohibited dealings with Iran -- dealings that indisputably helped sustain a global threat to peace and stability.\" The regulator had ordered executives of Standard Chartered -- which it says was operating as a \"rogue institution\" -- to appear in New York Wednesday to answer the charges. How did Standard Chartered respond to the allegations? Standard Chartered refuted the charges, saying \"well over 99.9%\" of the referenced transactions complied with U.S. regulations. It said it strongly rejected the position and portrayal of facts made by the U.S. regulator. The statement said the group had approached U.S. agencies in January 2010 and informed them they had initiated a review of historic U.S. dollar transactions and compliance with U.S. sanctions. It said the \"group does not believe the order issued by the DFS presents a full and accurate picture of the facts,\" and \"Standard Chartered ceased all new business with Iranian customers in any currency over five years ago.\" How much will this damage Standard Chartered? The large fine was expected and, as Symonds pointed out, is unlikely to significantly dent the bank's balance sheet. However, pressure has come down on chief executive Peter Sands, who flew to New York City to deal with the allegations. Sands has been at the bank's helm since 2006 following four years as group finance director. David Marshall, senior bank analyst at CreditSights, said in a note the fine was a \"little underwhelming\" given the strength of the original charges. The bank has been \"tarred\" but immediate regulatory pressure will be \"relieved for now,\" he said. \"It doesn't mean corporates will withdraw their business, but they will likely ask more questions,\" he added. Standard Chartered shares rallied on news of the U.S. settlement.",

The British government urged Libya on Friday not to celebrate the anniversary of the convicted bomber's release, saying it would be \"offensive and deeply insensitive\" to the families of the 270 people killed in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Scotland. Also Friday, the Obama administration again blasted the decision by Scotland to release Abdelbeset Ali Mohmed al Megrahi from prison exactly a year ago on compassionate grounds due to a diagnosis of terminal cancer. \"As we have expressed repeatedly to Scottish authorities, we maintain that al Megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in Scotland,\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement. President Barack Obama's assistant on homeland security and counterterrorism, John Brennan, called the release of al Megrahi \"unfortunate and inappropriate.\" Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg noted al Megrahi was only given three months to live when he released, but he is still alive today. Menendez noted that on August 20, 2009, al Megrahi stepped off a plane into the arms of a cheering throng in Libya. \"A mass murderer tasted freedom, experiencing joy,\" Menendez said. \"It was a scene that made the stomach turn ... that made old wounds fresh again in the hearts of those whose family members died at the hands of that man.\" Lautenberg said, \"It is the families of those victims who deserve compassion, not this terrorist.\" \"Al Megrahi ... is very much free, living in the lap of luxury by all accounts,\" Menendez said. Doctors who examined the convicted terrorist in prison now say he could live another 10 years, he said. The case has outraged many on both sides of the Atlantic, and led U.S. senators to demand answers from Scotland about the details of his release. Menendez said his office has sent letters to British Prime Minister David Cameron and Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, \"laying out those areas where questions linger\" and asking for additional answers and documentation. Scottish authorities have defended their actions in the case, saying Justice Secretary Kenny MacAskill relied on a medical report from the top doctor in the Scottish Prison Service, along with reports from the parole board and prison governor, in deciding to free al Megrahi, who had been serving a life sentence. \"We took the decision in good faith,\" Salmond told Sky News on Friday. \"We followed the judicial processes, the law of Scotland and the jurisdiction the Lockerbie atrocity has been governed [by], not for the last year, but for the last 20 years.\" Under the Scotland Act of 1998, Scotland has its own government that is responsible for most of the day-to-day issues there, including the justice system. It took charge of the case because the flight al Megrahi was convicted of bombing exploded over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. Scottish authorities have insisted that three doctors hired by Libya to assess al Megrahi's condition last year played no part in the decision to release him. Menendez said he wants to know what was discussed when the doctors met with Libyan officials. Dr. Andrew Fraser, the director of health and care at the Scottish Prison Service, also said the three-month prognosis was a reasonable estimate. U.S. senators also have repeatedly voiced suspicions that Scotland released al Megrahi as part of a deal allowing BP to drill off the Libyan coast. Salmond has already shot down such concerns, saying \"there is no evidence whatsoever\" of any link. Menendez plans to chair a U.S. Senate hearing in September on the controversy surrounding al Megrahi's release. Friday, Menendez said the senators have asked the British and Scottish governments to conduct an independent investigation in the United Kingdom, which he said Cameron supported before he became prime minister. Lautenberg called on British and Scottish officials to stop \"stonewalling and side-tracking.\" \"Help us clear the air; help us give information to the families.\" Menendez also said letters are being sent to Libyan and Qatari leaders, inquiring whether \"commercial interests\" led them to pressure Britain and Scotland to release al Megrahi. Al Megrahi is the only person ever convicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie in December 1988, killing 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground. Most of the dead were Americans. The flight had been heading to New York from Frankfurt, Germany, via London, England, when it blew up. A special Scottish court in the Netherlands convicted al Megrahi in 2001.",

    "input": "Louisville, Kentucky (CNN) -- Detective Steve Watts is locking up another accused pain pill addict. But he's seen this suspect before. She's back in handcuffs for the second time in less than a week. The charge this time, like it was just four days ago, is fraudulently obtaining prescription medication. For Watts and the other detectives of the Louisville Police Department Prescription Drug Diversion Squad, it will be one of 500 to 600 arrests they make each year. Even with arrests nearly every day, \"We're just scratching the surface,\" according to Watts. The number of investigations the unit initiates is up 148 percent compared with a year ago. It can be surprisingly easy to get prescription narcotics that are highly addictive, and they're highly profitable on the street. But detectives in Louisville say most of the people they arrest aren't in it for the money. Instead, they get pills to support their own habit, and police say they have a variety of methods for feeding their addiction. A former nurse will use her medical training to impersonate a doctor to call in fake prescriptions to a pharmacy and simply go in and pick up her drug of choice. Others use prescription pads stolen from physicians or \"doctor shop\" by getting legitimate prescriptions from multiple doctors who are unaware of what other drugs their patients are already taking. Watts sees his job as giving those he arrests a wake-up call. \"If I can make this the worst day of her life so that tomorrow she will seek treatment, then I've won,\" he said. Kentucky is among the top states in the country for prescription pill abuse, according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. \"People think that, well, it's authorized by my doctor, we can pick it up at any of the local retailers on the corner, and that prescription abuse is not really a problem,\" Watts said. The vast majority of those Watts and his fellow detectives arrest start their addiction with legitimate needs for pain medication from something such as a car accident. But then they can't stop. That's what worries physicians such as Dr. David Greene. \"We know that narcotics are potentially addictive -- we don't know who might become addicted and who might not,\" he said. Greene practices in eastern Kentucky, where he says prescription pill abuse is rampant. \"It's come to the point where there are few people who don't have someone in their family or know someone who's had problems with addiction, overdose or abuse,\" Greene said. When patients come looking for a prescription for powerful pain medication, doctors like him are forced to determine whether the need is real or whether the patient might be an addict. \"There's no test for pain,\" Greene said. \"The only thing we have to go on is what they tell us, and I generally believe my patients. But most people who are going to lie to you are much better liars than you are at detecting.\" One of those patients who Greene says fooled him was a 79-year-old grandmother who was selling her pills out of her nursing home. If the patient is an addict, doctors refuse them at their own peril. In December, a man came into Dr. Dennis Sandlin's rural clinic in Perry County, Kentucky, looking for a prescription. Sandlin demanded that he take a urinalysis test to check for drugs in his system. Later that morning, the patient returned and shot and killed Sandlin. \"My dad was writing in a chart at the nurse's station. Someone heard my dad say, 'You don't want to do this. I take care of a lot of elderly people.' And he said, 'well you didn't help me' and that's when he shot him,\" Sandlin's daughter Danielle said. Danielle is now working to raise awareness of the dilemma doctors face in prescribing pain medication. Her father, she said, was rigorous about prescribing pain medication. \"He would drug test the pope if he came in asking for something.\" Greene has encountered intimidating patients in his clinic as well. \"Physical violence is a real fear. We have people who come in who are threatening and abusive,\" he said. After having one patient impersonate him, Greene no longer calls in controlled substances prescriptions into local pharmacies. Some doctors, fearing either physical violence or contributing to addiction, have stopped prescribing pain medication altogether. That puts doctors such as Greene, who do prescribe, in a difficult position. \"No matter what you do, you're going to have an unintended consequence,\" Greene said. \"If you refuse to prescribe, you'll end up with people suffering. And if you do prescribe, you'll find patients diverting them, selling them, using them for recreation.\" The solutions, police and doctors say, range from electronic prescriptions that would be difficult to forge to a national prescription database that would allow doctors to see what other drugs a pill-seeking patient is already taking. Danielle Sandlin is pushing for some kind of reform in the wake of her father's death. \"He lost his life for something as silly as a pill.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Since \"The Blair Witch Project,\" \"Cloverfield\" and \"Paranormal Activity,\" it's been impossible to see a camcorder movie without steeling yourself for some monstrous horror lurking just offscreen. \"Project X\" is supposed to be a comedy, but parents with teenagers -- or parents with kids who may one day turn into teenagers -- will regard it with much the same mixture of dread and terror. It's Thomas' 17th birthday. Mom and Dad have recklessly elected to take off for the weekend. Sure, they know he'll probably have friends over, but they trust him to use his common sense, and anyway, he doesn't have that many friends. But they reckon without the influence of his determined buddy Costa, who puts all his considerable social networking skills to promoting what turns out to be the ultimate house party. Beer will be chugged, tequila slammed, pills popped (cherries too), furnishings trashed, cars crashed, there will be fire, SWAT teams and loud noise late into the night. Oh yes, my friends, the peace will be disturbed! There's nothing new about any of this -- the wild party is firmly entrenched in youths' rites of passage in the movies and in high school lore across the land. In my day, it was Tom Cruise turning his home into a brothel and getting on the wrong side of Guido the Killer Pimp. Now, it's Thomas Mann orchestrating a rave in his backyard and stupidly ripping off a frazzled drug dealer by the name of T-Rick. (Kids, if you take away just one lesson from this movie, let it be this: There's no percentage in ripping off your dealer.) Still, it seems to me Cruise was at least respectful of those working girls. To Thomas and the gangsta-mouthed Costa (Oliver Cooper), even their classmates are \"hos\" and \"b*tches.\" If this movie has it right, today's teen culture is about what you would expect from a demographic brainwashed on a junk media diet of rap, pornography and reality TV. Please note, I said \"If.\" \"Superbad\" seems almost quaint in comparison -- and a whole lot funnier, in my opinion. Not that there's any point in sermonizing about such a self-consciously anarchic celebration of adolescent hedonism. There's not much to it, but at least there's a trace of punk rebellion in the orgy of destruction visited on a comfortably middle-class suburban home -- even if the coda dubiously suggests that this could be the shortcut to social status and parental respect. Yeah, as my kid would say, right. Directed by newcomer Nima Nourizadeh from what must have been a stick-thin screenplay, \"Project X\" loses more than it gains from the \"videography\" gambit. It is indifferently acted and in too much of a rush for quick hits to establish anything like the lull and swell of a real rave -- there's no undertow, no rapture, just a randomized string of highs and lows. Even the hangover is shortchanged (despite a producer credit for \"Hangover\" director Todd Phillips). That's not to say there aren't at least a few outrageous gags, YouTube moments to share, but mostly this looks like exactly what it is: a wasted opportunity.",

The wicket-keeper was pictured at Benazir International Airport in Islamabad by AFP on Monday after flying in from London, his base since November. He was also pictured with Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik, who AFP said had assured Haider he would be safe to return to his homeland. Haider fled from the team's base in Dubai prior to a one day international match with South Africa, telling CNN when he arrived in London that he feared reprisals over his decision. Upon his return to Pakistan he was quoted by AFP as saying: \"I am happy to return. There were solid reasons behind my going to London and I am sure everyone realized that no one can put his career at stake for nothing. \"I am happy the way I was given full security. I want to spend some time with my family and then meet PCB (Pakistan Cricket Board) chairman (Ijaz Butt) which I will share with you.\" AFP also quoted Malik as saying: \"Haider will be given full security as promised. He is a citizen of Pakistan so there is no restriction on his movement. He has told us some facts which at this point of time we cannot share with the media.\" The Pakistan Cricket Board ripped up Haider's contract after he left the team's camp in the United Arab Emirates with the player applying for political asylum in the UK. He granted CNN an exclusive interview when he arrived in London, saying: \"I listened to people in Pakistan who talked about the match fixing [problem], they said that a lot of people are involved and I felt threatened ... and very disappointed. \"I know I can't believe anyone. If you got threatened then you would then not believe people either. If I told anyone, they may have contact with these people [involved in match-fixing], so this could cause a problem for my family in Pakistan and also me in Dubai.\" Pakistan cricket has been dogged by allegations of corruption and three of Haider's former teammates, Salman Butt, Mohammad Aamer and Mohammad Asif, were banned after the International Cricket Council found them guilty of \"spot-fixing.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Wiping tears from his cheeks, a man who survived avalanches that killed eight snowmobilers in western Canada said Wednesday that he and two others tried to save their friends but eventually left the mountain because of the threat of more slides. Jeffrey Adams says he freed himself and helped free two others before making a \"gut-wrenching\" decision to leave. Jeffrey Adams, with his his fiancÃ©e at his side, said he and the two other survivors \"did everything we could to try to save\" the eight Sunday. \"They died doing what they loved. ... I'm truly sorry to the families that we couldn't find them,\" Adams said. Adams described digging himself out after the avalanches struck the group Sunday in British Columbia about 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) east of Fernie, a town in the Canadian Rockies about 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of Calgary, Alberta. Both avalanches left him buried but near the surface, he said. He was able to dig himself out, choking on snow, and free a second companion without gloves or gear.  Watch Adams describe digging himself, others out Â» . Adams and six others had been snowmobiling near the base of a mountain when the first avalanche happened, he said. The avalanche buried him for \"a minute or two,\" but he was able to free himself. He started digging for a companion as another group of four people showed up to help, Adams said. One called 911 on a transmitter. But then they heard a crack, and a second slide buried all 11 of them, Adams said. Miraculously, he said, only 8 to 10 inches of snow covered him. \"When I opened my eyes, I could see daylight,\" he said. \"I was digging. I managed to get my mouth free. I was already choking. I took a few breaths. After about five minutes of struggling, I got myself out, looked around and realized there wasn't anybody else -- couldn't see any sleds, no gear, nothing.\" He yelled for his friends and heard an answer, and he was able to dig out one man, whom he identified as Jeremy. The two were working on freeing a third man, James, when they heard another crack. \"We said, 'Sorry, James, we've got to run,' \" Adams remembered tearfully. \"As we were running away from James, he was saying, 'Don't leave me here! Don't leave me here!' We kept saying we're sorry. We went off and sat to the side, and the slide never hit us in the area we were in. We just got the snow cloud. We went back in and finally got James out.\" But then the three looked around and saw no one. They considered getting the one snowmobile that wasn't struck by the avalanche, but determined that the area was too unsafe. \"That's when we had to make the gut-wrenching decision to leave our eight friends and start walking off the mountain,\" an emotional Adams said. The group had walked for about 10 minutes and was thinking of going back, but when he turned to look, \"the whole center of the mountain came down\" in a fourth avalanche. \"We just decided our best bet was to keep walking,\" he said. They were hoping for a helicopter in response to the earlier 911 call, he said, and one eventually arrived and picked them up. Searchers found seven bodies Monday and the eighth Tuesday. Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified the dead as Danny Bjarnason, 28; Kane Rusnak, 30; Warren Rothel, 33; Michael Stier, 20; Len Stier, 45; Blayne Wilson, 26; Kurt Kabel, 28; and Thomas Talarico, 32. Adams and the other two survivors, James and Jeremy -- whose last names and ages were not given -- suffered minor injuries. One was hospitalized overnight. \"It's hard,\" Adams said. \"I replay it in my head all the time whether it was the right decision or not.\" He said he had spoken with the families of most of the other men. \"So far, all of them are supporting our decision to leave,\" he said. \"It was a hard one, to leave eight guys up there.\" He described the victims as \"good buddies,\" his voice breaking. Experts told him the second avalanche hit the group at 150 kph (93 mph), Adams said. He estimated the wall of snow was 15 feet high. He said members of the group knew the avalanche danger was high, and that's why they weren't climbing the mountain. Even buried under a few inches of snow, \"you don't know what way is up and what is down,\" he said. \"You can't move. You simply can't move in it,\" Adams said. The snowmobilers were from Sparwood, British Columbia. They were in an area called Harvey Pass, which police called \"a popular backcountry snowmobile destination.\" Sparwood Mayor David Wilks said all the victims were upstanding citizens who worked as businessmen or in coal mines. The mayor said temperatures were as low as minus 30 degrees Fahrenheit in recent weeks, though the air had warmed to 25 degrees Fahrenheit. The warmer temperatures could melt and loosen packed snow, raising the danger of avalanches.",

    "input": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The highly fortified International Zone in Baghdad came under fire the same day that Vice President Joe Biden paid a surprise visit, an Interior Ministry official told CNN. Vice President Joe Biden talks to the media Tuesday in Baghdad's fortified International Zone. Biden was not injured, according to CNN's Chris Lawrence, who was traveling with the vice president. But at least one round seems to have landed in the U.S. Embassy grounds, U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill said. The zone houses the embassy and many government buildings. Lawrence said he heard the blasts but saw no damage. CNN's Cal Perry said he heard four loud \"booms.\" Warning alarms were sounded, and security was stepped up in the International Zone, which is informally known as the Green Zone. It is not clear what weapons were fired or if Biden was near the location where the rounds hit. For security reasons, reporters traveling with the vice president are not allowed to report his location.  Watch as Lawrence reports on the attack Â» . A U.S. military spokesman said he could confirm only that one round hit, and he said it did not land in the International Zone. \"Initial reports indicate one round of indirect fire impacted near the International Zone, not in it,\" Lt. Col. Phillip Smith, a spokesman for the U.S. military in Baghdad, told CNN. But Hill told reporters that some sort of projectile landed in the east end of the embassy complex. He said the projectile was the reason for a \"duck-and-cover\" alarm that journalists traveling with Biden heard during a briefing by top U.S. officials in Baghdad. The alarm sounded intermittently throughout almost the entire 35-minute briefing by Hill and the top U.S. general in Iraq, Ray Odierno, Lawrence said. Odierno and Hill did not seem concerned, he said. No one jumped up or tried to run out of the building. They paused if they were talking when the alarm sounded, and picked up when it stopped. There was an \"all-clear\" as the briefing ended. Hill said it is kind of unusual to get this type of attack now. He said they used to happen 10 to 12 times a day, but now are few and far between. Biden's visit was widely reported on Iraqi television, Perry said. He is in Iraq to meet with the country's leaders and visit U.S. troops, his office said. Journalists on the plane with the vice president were not told where they were going until after they were on the way. Biden was due to sit down with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani and Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, as well as Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government, and other officials. He was greeted at the airport at dusk by Gen. Odierno, Ambassador Hill and Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari.  Watch Biden arrive in Iraq, greet troops Â» . He flew by helicopter to the International Zone. Biden, Hill, Odierno and Deputy Secretary of State Jim Steinberg, who is traveling with Biden, then went into a meeting. They did not speak to reporters. This is Biden's third trip to Iraq this year, after visits in July and January. \"The president has asked the vice president to provide sustained, high-level focus from the White House on Iraq, and this trip is part of that mission,\" the White House said in a statement issued as Biden arrived. The United States is less than a year away from its goal of withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq. Hill has said the next 12 months are \"very critical\" to establishing security in Iraq, but the goal of withdrawing most U.S. troops by August 2010 is \"absolutely achievable.\" Biden said Odierno is \"optimistic\" that Iraqi forces will be ready in time to allow U.S. withdrawals to go ahead as planned, according to Lawrence.

    "input": "(CNN) -- French Prime Minister Francois Fillon unveiled further details Monday of a 26 billion-euro ($33 billion) business stimulus package which his government hopes can stall falling growth and prevent the country joining other major European economies in recession. Up to 1,000 projects will benefit from the package, which was first proposed by President Nicolas Sarkozy in December and approved by French lawmakers last week. Around 20 billion euros of the total amount will be spent over the next 12 months. Businesses will receive 11.4 billion euros while the same amount will be invested in public projects with social housing identified as a priority. The final 4 billion euros will be spent on improving France's transport, energy and postal service infrastructure. The package is expected to stimulate economic growth of around 1.3 percent, Fillon said. France has so far avoided the worst of the recession that has gripped many of its western European neighbors, including Germany and the UK. But unemployment rose by a further 45,000 in December after surging by 64,000 in November, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde said Monday, adding that she would be \"very surprised\" if France experienced positive growth in 2009. Speaking to CNN this weekend at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Lagarde, defended the case for public spending in the face of fears that stimulus packages amounted to storing up unmanageable debts for future generations. \"When the house is on fire we don't look at what can be built, Lagarde said. \"We need to kick start (the economy) and we need to restore confidence.\"",

    "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The U.S. Air Force is grounding more than 100 planes used to support ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan because of fatigue cracks in the wings, Air Force officials said Friday. Aircraft like this A-10 Warthog provide close support to ground troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The officials said 127 A-10 Thunderbolt IIs, including some used in the United States, will be grounded until they are each inspected for the cracks. \"The inspections are a necessary step in addressing the risk associated with A-10 wing cracking, specifically with thin-skin wings. This risk is of great concern to the Air Force and is representative of a systemic problem for our aging Air Force fleet,\" the Air Force said. The A-10 Thunderbolt II, nicknamed the \"Warthog\" because of its unique un-aerodynamic look, is one of the Air Force's older aircraft, having first been delivered to the service in 1975. The average age of the A-10 fleet is now 28 years, but the entire Air Force fleet has an average age of 25 years, according to Air Force statistics. The Air Force has more than 400 A-10s in its fleet. The cracks in the older A-10 A-models and A-10 C-models were discovered at Hill Air Force Base in Utah during routine maintenance. No A-10 has had an accident because of the cracks just discovered, according to Air Force officials. The inspection of the 127 planes will give priority to the planes in the Iraq and Afghanistan theaters of battle, officials said. The plane was designed as a tank killer, with a front-mounted Gatling gun that fires 30-mm armor-piercing ammunition capable of destroying a tank. The planes are now primarily used in Iraq and Afghanistan to protect ground troops in close combat situations, flying low and slow and with the ability to target individuals hidden on mountainsides or rooftops. Last year, the Air Force grounded hundreds of F-15 fighter jets after one fell apart during a training mission. The culprit was a fatigued longeron, a part that holds the fuselage together. Numerous F-15s flying in Iraq and Afghanistan also were grounded until they were inspected, forcing the service to fly other aircraft in their place. The Navy was also asked to help cover the F-15 missions during the weeks they were grounded.",

Twenty-one children -- ranging in age from 5 to 17 -- were on the St. Landry Parish school bus when it was hit while pulling back onto a highway in central Louisiana, Louisiana State Police said in a news release. Earlier Friday state police indicated that the crash left three children -- ages 5 and 15, plus one more whose age was unknown -- in critical condition. As of 5 p.m., Port Barre High School Principal William Duplechain said, 19 students had been treated and released from hospitals, and two remained in critical condition. They included a kindergarten student, who was unresponsive, according to the principal. The other was a middle-schooler who was placed in a medically induced coma so surgeons could operate on his broken leg. Gil Savoy, a substitute bus driver, was driving the students when the accident occurred, Port Barre Town Clerk Toria Comeaux said. Savoy is the mayor of Port Barre, a community of about 2,400 people some 30 miles north of Lafayette. He had pulled over on the side of U.S. 190 and, after all the students had boarded, began to slowly move forward \"with all of his warning devices still activated,\" according to Louisiana State Police. At that point, an 18-wheel truck driven by David Cox, 52, of Dallas, Texas, rammed into the bus from behind, police said. Comeaux said that the truck, which she was driving behind, had debris coming off it at the time of the crash. Both Savoy and Cox suffered minor injuries, with \"routine toxicology samples\" taken from both, the state police said. No one has been charged, and the investigation is ongoing. Video from CNN affiliates KLFY and KATC showed severe damage to the back of the bus and to the tractor-trailer's front. Anthony Standberry, a St. Landry Parish school board member, told KLFY that the speed limit on that stretch of U.S. 190 is 65 mph. He said he favors working with parents and school officials to remove all bus stops along major highways. CNN's Max Newfield and Vivian Kuo contributed to this report.",

Police had tried to stop the truck on a nearby street after they realized it was taken during an aggravated robbery in Fort Worth, Texas, on Wednesday, Dallas police said in a statement. The driver refused to stop and the chase began shortly after 2:30 p.m. The man drove the silver Chevrolet through an airport gate and down one runway, drove across the taxiway to another and back in the opposite direction. \"Air traffic was suspended on that runway, however there were several plane[s] at the opposite end of the runway that the suspect began driving towards,\" the statement said. \"Supervisors monitoring the pursuit made the decision to terminate the pursuit by whatever means necessary so as to preserve the safety of the occupants of the planes. Officers were able to strike the suspect vehicle with their police car, causing it to spin out and ultimately come to a stop. The suspect was taken into custody shortly after that.\" A knife believed to have been used in the Fort Worth robbery was recovered in the truck, police said. The suspect was identified as Michael Laurence Brown, 46. Police said the suspect may be linked to other crimes. Charges in the airport incident will follow an initial investigation, police said. \"Although all major incidents such as this are reviewed to ensure all proper procedures were followed, it appears all the officers involved did an outstanding job to bring a dangerous pursuit to a safe end while getting a violent criminal off the streets,\" according to the police statement. Four commercial carriers and several general aviation companies use the airport, located just north of downtown Dallas. The chase shut down operations for about 10 minutes, forcing one arriving aircraft to delay its landing and holding departing planes on the ground, FAA spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said.",

    "input": "(Good.is) -- By far, my greatest interests in life are words and humor. I'm obsessed with both, which is why my favorite comedian is the late George Carlin -- the funny man most obsessed with how we talk. Nothing has ever floated the boats of my two obsessions more than a good Carlin DVD or book. Until now. The publication of \"Green's Dictionary of Slang\" -- a product of 17 years of work that make it the largest slang dictionary ever published in English -- is a glorious event for anyone who loves words and likes to laugh. Covering slang from the United States to England, New Zealand, and beyond, Jonathon \"Mr. Slang\" Green records and documents more than 100,000 words and idioms in an OED-like, quotation-packed historical dictionary. Those terms range from the crude (\"sweat bird turds,\" meaning \"work hard\") to the subtle (\"give someone the mitten\" -- end a relationship) and everywhere in between. As Green says, slang is \"...vibrant, creative, witty, and open to seemingly infinite re-invention. It is voyeuristic, amoral, libertarian, and libertine. It is vicious. It is cruel. It is self-indulgent. It is funny. It is fun.\" So is this dictionary. Folks have struggled to define slang for centuries. One of the most accepted definitions is \"Historical Dictionary of American Slang\" editor Jonathan Lighter's claim -- \"The aim and chief function of slang is to lower and disavow the dignity of discourse.\" Good: 'Mass Transit:' A dance performance inspired by riding L.A.'s buses . Michael Adams -- author of \"Slang: The People's Poetry\" -- offers a complementary view: \"... it's not just that slang lowers dignity, but that dignity is under criticism in slang ... To the extent that everyday speech is boring, slang is meant to elevate discourse, not lower it.\" As for Jonathon Green, in the intro to his massive new dictionary, he writes, \"I would call slang a 'counter-language,' the desire of human beings, when faced by a standard version, of whatever that might be, to come up with something different, perhaps parallel, perhaps oppositional.\" That drive to coin words seems as biologically driven as many of the topics slang usually names. As Green notes, \"...the basic concerns remain consistent in slang as they do in much that is human: sex, money, intoxication, fear (of others), aggrandizement (of oneself).\" Within any of those topics, the range of vocabulary is astounding. Take sex. One my favorite euphemisms -- \"Ugandan discussion\" -- is included, as well as many variations on themes, such as \"playing.\" You can \"play at\" itch-buttocks, all fours, belly-to-belly, blindman's bluff, bo-peep, fathers and mothers, and handie-dandie. Good: More college grads are taking nonprofit jobs. But is it just a fad? You can also play \"night baseball,\" \"the first game ever played,\" or \"Mr. Wobbly hides his helmet.\" The most romantic term might be \"bouncing refrigerators.\" I'm going to add that to the hobbies list on my dating profile immediately. Beyond sex, the range of terms and types of terms is enough to make your top-hamper (head) spin. There are comic book-y sound effects, like \"kerplunk,\" \"kaplunk,\" and \"ka-plonk.\" There's British rhyming slang, including \"Dick Van Dyke\" (bike), \"two eyes of blue\" (too true), and \"Meryl Streep\" (sleep). There are indefinite words, such as \"thingahoochie\" and \"thingsmadoodle,\" plus exclamations like \"Holy creeping Jesus!\" Pop culture is well-represented, as \"go to the mattresses\" is traced to Maria Puzo's The Godfather in 1969, and \"neo maxi zoom dweebie\" was coined in The Breakfast Club in 1985. College slang appears often, nowhere as blatantly as in \"undue perversity\" -- a nickname for Purdue University. Speaking of education -- and as a teacher myself -- I love the term \"gerund-grinder\": an 18th century insult for a schoolteacher. That's not even the tip of the tip of the slangberg: Green's lexical buffet seems to go on forever. Of course, even the biggest and best slang dictionary ever can't be complete or perfect. I think Lighter's Historical Dictionary of American Slang (HDAS) is a slightly better word book -- in theory, if not fact. Sadly, that incredible project has never been finished, and what is published is a tad out of date. I was also stunned by some omissions in Green's. How can \"assmunch\" and \"meh\" miss the cut when so many obscurities are listed? Then again, I'm sure every English speaker knows some slang terms that didn't get scooped up. Good: Low-tech project inspires community engagement in New Orleans . When looking at such a massive, well-documented collection of words, griping about what's missing is a tad ungrateful: like dissing Christina Hendricks for not being voluptuous enough. It's a shame George Carlin didn't live to see this amazing work, which is awesome in the \"causing awe\" and \"whoa, dude\" senses. In addition to his prolific comedy, Carlin was a bit of a lexicographer himself -- Green cites some of Carlin's 2,443 Dirty Words several times. I bet Carlin would appreciate Green's spin on slang: . \"To me its greatest charm is that at its heart, even its most obscene and gutter-dwelling heart, it is subversive. This is not political subversion -- slang is above politics -- but a subversion of the English language itself. And by subverting English, it subverts the givens of the world that English informs.\" Carlin, a lifelong subversive and committed atheist, once speculated that his soul might go to a garage in Buffalo. I hope someone finds that garage and sends a copy of Green's massive record of our naughty mother tongue there -- stat. He would love it. Â© 2010 Good. All rights reserved.",

    "input": "(Travel + Leisure) -- From Fitzrovia to Covent Garden, London is embracing its charming -- and sometimes cheeky -- past. Every era, from the roaring '20s to the swinging '60s, is represented, with new takes on old-fashioned locales: chip and sweets shops, hidden Prohibition-style hangouts, even ballrooms. The shelves at Hope and Greenwood, in Covent Garden, are filled with glass jars brimming with British sweets. But rather than flaunt themselves as fusty Churchillian relics, these new spots are drawing stylish Bright Young Things who can't get enough of the city's collective nostalgia trip. They're celebrating inspired design, tastes and bygone lifestyles with zeal. At the forefront of London's retro renaissance: sugar. Behind a shiny strawberry-red faÃ§ade in Covent Garden, British confectionary is experiencing a resurgence at Hope and Greenwood, a sweet 1950s-style candy store named after its sugar-loving owners. Glass jars and cut-crystal candy dishes that grandma would love brim with classic and all-but-disappeared \"pick and mix\" English candies -- Minty Humbugs, Raspberry Ruffles and Traffic Light Lollies. It's the kind of place that will even inspire adults on a strict diet to indulge in sweets (and sweet thoughts) of yesteryear. Travel + Leisure: See London's best retro spots . Over in the trendy, up-and-coming neighborhood of Marble Arch, Cocomaya is attracting followers with its jewel-like handcrafted chocolates tantalizingly displayed under glass domes on marble counter tops and antique mirrors. And places such as East End's Treacle are delighting locals and visitors alike with a return to the no-nonsense proper British teahouse, serving up comforting classics like Jammy Dodgers and buttercream cupcakes. Bourne & Hollingsworth (named after the department store that once existed on its site) is decidedly more adult; the quirky basement bar in Fitzrovia is tricked out to feel like grandma's -- complete with signature floral wallpaper and consciously stodgy dÃ©cor. Still, zany accents, like a fireplace full of discarded Champagne bottles, reflect the underground boÃ®te's joie de vivre spirit of excess. On Prohibition themed nights, vintage gin cocktails arrive hidden in teapots, as Billie Holliday sets the mood. Geales, in Notting Hill, is the ideal spot to start -- or end -- an evening on the town, London-style. Now a shadow of its former 1939 no-frills self, the newly renovated fish and chips shop is giving a lighter gourmet twist to an old London standby; golden, delicately fried cod and haddock is the restaurant's main event, supported by more elegant briny treats like raw oysters and classic shrimp cocktail. No matter where you go in London town these days, vintage style is everywhere. What's old is new -- again! -- in England's retro-mad city. Planning a beach getaway?

    "input": "London, England (CNN) -- The fashion brand created by Alexander McQueen is to survive despite the designer's suicide last week, the label's majority stakeholder Gucci Group has confirmed. \"I believe strongly in the Alexander McQueen brand and its future,\" Gucci Group CEO Robert Polet said in a statement carried on the Web site of Gucci parent PPR. The future of McQueen's 11-store, 180 employee fashion house had been uncertain following the 40-year-old's death, with industry experts speculating it was not successful enough to endure without its figurehead. PPR on Thursday revealed a company-wide net profit rise of 6.9 percent to â¬984.6 million ($1,328 million) but a 4 percent revenue fall to â¬16.52 billion. It did not break down figures to reveal McQueen's turnover, but reports speculate the brand is running at a loss despite heavy celebrity endorsements. The Times of London reported on Thursday that the label had struggled to make a profit and analysis of recent accounts showed it had liabilities of more than Â£32 million ($49 million). PPR boss Francois-Henri Pinault said in a statement: \"Lee Alexander [McQueen] was a pure genius and a poet who was imaginative and original. His art went beyond the fashion world. The Alexander McQueen trademark will live on. This is the best tribute that we could offer to Lee.\" McQueen's death last week shocked the world of fashion, with many in the industry paying tribute to a man they described as a unique talent capable of becoming a major name. A coroner on Wednesday said McQueen hanged himself in his wardrobe and left a suicide note . McQueen, who had dressed stars from Sarah Jessica Parker and Nicole Kidman to Rihanna and Sandra Bullock, killed himself nine days after the death of his mother. He expressed his devastation at her death on his Twitter account days before he died. McQueen was born in 1970 in London's East End, the son of a taxi driver and trained in London's Savile Row, going on to study fashion at college before making his name with his own extravagant designs.

    "input": "Jos, Nigeria (CNN) -- A government official condemned Monday the series of Christmas Day attacks on churches in Nigeria that killed 35 people, blaming an extremist group that has claimed responsibility for similar attacks in the last two years. \"The latest mindless and cowardly attacks by Boko Haram members specifically directed at churches were premeditated,\" said retired Gen. Andrew Azazi, the national security adviser to President Goodluck Jonathan, in a statement. \"Only last week, five improvised explosive devices were recovered in five churches at Mubi in Adamawa State.\" The Boko Haram sect claimed responsibility for the attacks, government officials said. In the past, the group has targeted Christians and Muslims it considered insufficiently Islamic. In the bloodiest of Sunday's attacks on churches in five cities, 32 people were killed as services ended at St. Theresa's Catholic Church in Madalla in Niger State, Azazi said. Two people have been arrested, he added. Olusegun Okebiorun, controller-general of Nigeria's fire service, said that, in addition to the fatalities, 65 people were wounded in Madalla, which is located west of the capital city of Abuja. Attacks in the central Nigerian city of Jos in Plateau State northeast of the capital followed the same pattern, Azazi said. Two blasts targeted the Mountain of Fire Ministries church in Jos, said journalist Hassan John, who witnessed the carnage. No one was killed in the bombings, but a police officer who got into a gun battle with attackers died of his wounds, John said, citing officials. Police arrested four people and recovered four unexploded devices, Nigerian state television reported. The cities of Kano, Damaturu and Gadaka were also struck Sunday, John said. Officials said three people were killed in the blast in Damaturu, a northern town in Yobe state, John said. Also in Damaturu, a police station and a state security building were bombed, said an aid worker who, citing security concerns, asked not to be identified. In Yobe, security forces stopped a vehicle that was carrying a bomb, which detonated, killing \"the criminals\" and three security operatives, Azazi said. \"We renew our appeal to all Nigerians that this is not a fight between security forces and some dissident elements,\" he said. \"It is a conflict between some misguided extremists in our midst and the rest of our society, because the victims are not confined to any ethnic boundary. We must cooperate to fish them out. And because our cause is just and our collective resolve is stronger, together we shall prevail.\" The blasts mark the second consecutive holiday season that bombs have hit Christian houses of worship in the west African nation. In 2010, five churches in Jos were attacked on Christmas Eve. The blasts killed dozens in Jos, which lies on a faith-based fault line between the Muslim-dominated north and the mainly Christian south. CNN.com: Al Qaeda-linked group claims responsibility for bombing . In a statement issued late Sunday, Jonathan called the bombings \"a dastardly act that must attract the rebuke of all peace-loving Nigerians.\" In Washington, the White House said U.S. officials would help Nigeria pursue those behind \"what initially appear to be terrorist acts.\" \"We condemn this senseless violence and tragic loss of life on Christmas Day,\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said in a statement. \"We offer our sincere condolences to the Nigerian people and especially those who lost family and loved ones.\" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned the acts \"in the strongest terms,\" his office said in a statement. He expressed his condolences to the Nigerian people and reiterated a call \"for an end to all acts of sectarian violence in the country.\" Nigeria is Africa's most populous nation and has the world's sixth-largest Christian population -- about 80.5 million people as of 2010, according to a report published this month by the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life in Washington. That makes the country just over 50% Christian, according to Pew. Boko Haram translates from the local Hausa as \"Western education is outlawed.\" The group has morphed into an insurgency responsible for dozens of attacks in Nigeria in the last two years. Boko Haram's targets include police outposts and churches as well as places associated with \"Western influence.\" CNN's Josh Levs, Richard Allen Greene, Esprit Smith, Karen Smith, Amir Ahmed and Hamdi Alkhshali contributed to this report.",

    "input": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Legendary pinup queen Bettie Page died of pneumonia at the age of 85 in a Los Angeles, California, hospital Thursday, a week after suffering a heart attack, according to her agent. Pinup queen Bettie Page was credited with helping to usher in the sexual revolution. \"She captured the imagination of a generation of men and women with her free spirit and unabashed sensuality,\" said agent Mark Roesler in a written statement. \"She is the embodiment of beauty.\" Page, said to be one of the most photographed people of the past century, became a recluse in recent decades. Yet, her images continued to be used around the world to market Bettie Page action figures, clothing lines and other merchandise. \"Her popularity as an underground, guilty pleasures phenomenon has continued to soar despite the fact that the reclusive Page disappeared almost a half century ago, leading many to believe that one of the most photographed individuals of the 20th century was already dead.\" Roesler said. The Web site, BettiePage.com, logs about 20 million hits a month, Roesler said. A TVGuide.com poll recently placed Bettie Page as the \"ultimate sex goddess,\" outscoring others such as Marilyn Monroe. iReport.com: Share your trubutes to Bettie Page . Page was born to a poor family in Tennessee on April 22, 1923. While her birth certificate spelled her name \"Betty,\" she changed the spelling later in life to \"Bettie.\" At a time when few women pursued a college education, Page earned a bachelor of arts degree in education from Peabody College in Tennessee in 1944, according to her official biography. Her teaching career, however, was hampered by her looks, she said. \"I couldn't control my students, especially the boys,\" she is quoted as saying. After her modeling career ended, Page returned to Peabody College to work on a master's degree, the bio said. Her Southern drawl and a refusal to sleep with a Hollywood producer hampered her acting career, according to her bio. \"I didn't like his looks,\" Page said. \"I wouldn't have gone to bed with him anyway. He was a creep. He drove off in his big car and scolded me, 'You'll be sorry.' I wasn't.\" Page said she regretted not accepting studio boss Jack Warner's offer of another screen-test, but it came while she was trying to save her marriage to her first husband, Billy Neal. Her modeling breakthrough began after she divorced Neal in 1947 when she met a police officer whose hobby was photography. He suggested the black bangs, which became her trademark, her bio said. Not long after, her images were everywhere, gracing magazine covers and locker pin-ups. Page wore nothing but a Santa hat in Playboy's January 1955 centerfold. Playboy founder Hugh Hefner said her appearance in his magazine's first year was a milestone. \"She became, in time, an American icon, her winning smile and effervescent personality apparent in every pose,\" Hefner said. \"A kinky connection was added by Irving Klaw's spanking, fetish and bondage photos, which became part of the Bettie Page mystique,\" Hefner said. \"They were playful parodies that are now perceived as the early inspiration for Madonna's excursions into the realm of sexual perversion.\" Perhaps the most memorable photos of Page were her bondage poses, which she said were all pretend. \"I never understood how anyone believed those poses were sexy,\" she later said. \"To be tied up? I don't get it.\" \"She was a remarkable woman, truly someone that changed the social norms, not only here in this country, but also around the world,\" Roesler said. \"While Jackie Robinson was changing the racial attitudes, Bettie Page was changing our attitudes on sex. She became a James Dean type of 'rebel' figure as she allowed people to be less inhibited and look at sex in a different way.\" Saucy photos of Paige in skimpy clothing or none at all helped to lead the way for the sexual revolution of the 1960s. Page suddenly disappeared from the scene in 1958. It was only decades later revealed that she re-emerged to explain that she underwent a religious conversion and moved to Florida. Her life took a dark turn starting in 1978 after her third marriage failed, Roesler said. Page went through \"some mental instability, violent mood swings, and serious trouble with the law\" and was eventually diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic, according to her bio. Page reappeared in public in December 2003 for Playboy's 50th anniversary party, where she made a grand entrance with Anna Nicole Smith. It was the only time in the past 50 years that Page allowed her photograph to be taken, Roesler said. A private funeral service is planned for Tuesday. Page will buried at Westwood Cemetery in Los Angeles, just a few feet away from Monroe.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- As the sun set Sunday evening, millions of people in a mammoth chunk of the Central and Eastern United States finally got relief from scorching heat -- though, for many of them, it won't last long. Summer has been out in full force for days, baking areas from Missouri to New York to Georgia in life-threatening heat, and unleashing thunderstorms that knocked out power to millions and killed 13 people on Friday and Saturday. Then, three more people died Sunday afternoon after a fresh batch of storms. Between June 24 and Saturday, 1,928 record-high temperatures were broken or tied nationwide, not including new ones expected from Sunday that still aren't in the National Climatic Data Center's official count. Many cities and towns in the Southeast and Midwest saw temperatures Sunday that topped 100 degrees Fahrenheit, much like they've experienced in the few days prior, and the Northeast also saw blistering heat. The National Weather Service warned, for instance, that the heat index (or what it actually feels like) near the North Carolina coast could hit 120 degrees. Thunderstorms rolling across some of the roasting locales late Sunday afternoon brought some relief, but also danger as well. The National Weather Service reported that a man in Calico in eastern North Carolina, died around 4:30 p.m. when a shed fell on him as he was trying to store his golf cart. A few minutes later and about 15 miles east in Gilead, strong storm-related winds knocked over a tree that fell on a couple in a golf cart, killing them both. These deaths were tied to a batch of storms that affected not only North Carolina, but also South Carolina and Georgia. Another band moved east from the Chicago area through Ohio, at one point prompting a tornado warning. Tamara McBride, an Ohio Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman, said the latest storms downed trees and power lines to produce yet more outages. Yet as of Sunday night, there were no reports of new fatalities. The forecast in that state, like in many others through the Midwest, Southeast and Mid-Atlantic region, calls for slightly cooling Monday, compared to over the weekend. Yet temperature drops are all relative: It will be cooler, for instance, for residents of Louisville, Kentucky, but they can still expect a high of 99, and a heat index of 103, on Monday. In Columbus, Ohio, the thermometer is forecast to rise as high as 96, though it should feel even warmer. Many other locales should be even more sweltering, with highs Monday forecast yet again to be around or above 100 degrees from Missouri to South Carolina. The lack of any significant let up in the blistering conditions is a concern, authorities say, because the effects of heat can be cumulative -- so the longer you experience it, the more likely you are to experience conditions such as heat stroke, dehydration and the like. \"Current indications are that this heat wave may continue for much of the upcoming work week,\" the weather service's St. Louis bureau warned. \"Do not wait until the heat wave has lasted for several days, take action today to protect your health and continue to do so.\" Hundreds of thousands of people in Indiana through Maryland are still dealing with this heat without the benefits of electricity, due to a derecho -- or massive storm usually with straight-line wind damage -- that barreled eastward late Friday and into Saturday and was fueled, in part, by the extreme heat. The destruction prompted state of emergency declarations by governors of Maryland, Ohio, West Virginia and Virginia. Deaths tied to those storms were reported from Ohio to New Jersey, all of them linked to downed trees except for the electrocution of a man in Washington. Will 2012 be the hottest summer on record? Virginia had the highest death toll, at seven, with the state Department of Emergency Management noting the deaths were spread across four different counties. And in New Jersey, 2-year-old and 7-year-old cousins died after a fallen tree crashed on the tent they were huddling inside in Parvin State Park, state Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Larry Ragonese said. While down from a peak of about 4 million from right after the storms hit, the number of storm-related outages was still dangerously high given that people were trying to get by without working air conditioning or ice. Record heat, storms bring despair, 'horror' One of the most affected utilities was APE Ohio, which had around 425,000 customers out of power as of 10 p.m. Sunday. Widespread outages were reported further east as well, including over 310,000 Dominion customers in Virginia plus more than 490,000 outages in Maryland for customers of BGE and Pepco. \"It's the combination of heat and power outages that are hitting people,\" McBride from Ohio's emergency management agency said, predicting some may not get electricity until \"well into the week.\" \"As the days continue with food and without power, we will just have to mobilize resources.\" One such initiative, ordered by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is to have National Guard troops check on and help the state's most vulnerable, primarily the elderly and the ill. Cities throughout the affected regions offered water at certain sites and opened cooling shelters, including 35 in Virginia alone, to help people stay cool. Photos: Storm damage in Washington, D.C. Emergency rooms in Prince George's County, Maryland, filled up over the weekend by people looking to escape the heat, said Fran Phillips, deputy secretary for the state's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. She noted that libraries and community centers across the state would stay open late to act as cooling centers. \"This is not a one-day situation; it is a multiday challenge,\" said Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, who called it the largest power outage unrelated to a hurricane in his state's history. Instagram down in mass power outage .

    "input": "(CNN) -- I came to America as a transfer student in the fall of 2004. I did three years of computer engineering in India and then transferred to Purdue University Calumet. On July 2, 2005, just a month before graduation, a guy who lived on the first floor of my apartment building set fire to his place. He wrapped his baby in a blanket, put the baby in a car seat, put the car seat in the closet and then poured gasoline over the apartment with his baby and wife still in it. He then set the whole place on fire and left. The fire started at 4:30 a.m. My roommate and I could not jump out with the balcony and windows engulfed in flames. As my roommate fell unconscious in front of me, I started running down the stairs and passed out. A firefighter found my body and pulled me out. As the paramedics were taking me to the hospital, I heard one say, \"This guy is 95% burned; he doesn't have a chance.\" At that moment, I thought about my family and how I came to America to get good education, and now I didn't have a chance to live. I was soon unconscious and later woke up in the University of Chicago burn unit after four months in an induced coma. The man's wife, his baby and my best friend and roommate, Prabhat Singhal, died in the fire. After seven months in Chicago, I was transferred to Wishard Health Services in Indianapolis for my rehabilitation. I don't have any family in America so I lived in a nursing home. I stayed there for 2ÃÂ½ years while I went through reconstructive surgeries to regain range of motion in my arms. For more than five years, I went through an intense therapy program. I wore a face mask for three years and pressure garments on my entire body; I wore dynamic splints on my hands, wrists and elbows to increase range of motion, daily dressing changes to my wounds and performing hourly exercises to restore function in all of my joints. I wanted to get an MBA so I studied in my extra time. I scheduled my Graduate Management Admission Test, or GMAT, exam and got a six-hour pass from the nursing home to take the test. I scored 700 on my GMAT and got accepted into the Indiana University Kelley School of Business Evening MBA program in Indianapolis. I wanted to go to a part-time program since I didn't know how much of a course load I would be able to take. Everyone gets their acceptance letter mailed to his home; I got my letter mailed to the nursing home. My doctors did everything they could to help me regain range of motion in my arms. Even after 54 surgeries, I am still very limited. I don't have any finger movement in my left hand and very limited finger movement in my right hand. I type with one finger. I rely on various adaptive equipments to perform my activities of daily living. This horrific crime not only left me with disabilities but also interfered with my visa. I have not seen most of my family in India since the accident seven years ago, because I am still waiting on a green card. My sister has been denied a visa four times in trying to visit me. I have been able to come out of this tragedy because of the values that my parents instilled in me and the help from my occupational therapist. My parents taught me the value of education, hard work and perseverance. They taught me to be content in life no matter what the circumstances. They taught me that \"we can always find someone who is in worse condition than we are in. So be thankful for what you have.\" I call my occupational therapist, Shannon Hendricks, my guardian angel. God sent her into my life when I was in the deepest and darkest pit of my life. She took me to church every Sunday while I stayed in the nursing home, which brought some normalcy into my life. Today, I can live independently because of her hard work. After 3ÃÂ½ years, I graduated with my MBA on May 13. I am now seeking a job in finance. To give back to the community, I volunteered in the Wishard therapy department between many of my surgeries. I still visit the Wishard burn unit and talk to other burn patients about my experience. I also lecture at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis to occupational therapy students about all the adaptive equipment I use to live independently. I have had some wonderful people in my life who have helped me in my journey. I plan to do the same for other people.",

Inmates at the Fishkill Correctional Facility work with the dogs to prepare them to help wounded troops. Still, dogs are more than just companions. They can be the eyes for those who can't see, lead those who can't walk and calm people suffering from conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder. Where do these service dogs get their start? For some, it all begins behind prison walls... At the Fishkill Correctional Facility in upstate New York, more than 1,600 men convicted of abuse, robbery and murder are serving their time. \"I've been incarcerated for robbery in the first degree,\" an inmate named Michael says. \"I really had no regards for other people. It was always me, me, me, me.\" Now, a groundbreaking program called Puppies Behind Bars is transforming these offenders. Inmates are given 8-week-old puppies and taught to train them to become service dogs for the disabled, including wounded soldiers. The puppies and prisoners are together 24 hours a day. The puppies sleep in crates in the inmates' cells. In return, the puppies give the prisoners something many of them have never experienced before -- unconditional love. \"I'm going to make my family and those around me proud of me again. Joining this program, it helped me to give myself a sense of pride again. To know that by nurturing and raising these dogs to their fullest potential, that I could give back.\" Oprah.com: Amazing animal friendships you have to see . Animal lover and five-time Academy Award nominee Glenn Close first learned about Puppies Behind Bars when she volunteered to help inmates at the women's prison in her town. She was so moved by the impact of the program that she called \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\" herself to share this story. \"We know the bond that can be created between humans and animals. And there is common knowledge that it's a healing quality,\" she says. \"The bond that's created between inmates -- who never knew love, never knew responsibility, have only been told that they're worthless -- and the bond that they then train their dogs to establish with these wounded returning veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan is changing their lives.\" Oprah.com: 10 inspiring pets . Roberto is an inmate whose life has been changed by the program. Convicted of second-degree murder, Roberto has been in prison since he was 17. \"I am now 33 years old. I wish I could turn back the hands of time for the hurt and pain that I've caused so many people, especially my victim's family,\" he says. Roberto was chosen for Puppies Behind Bars and immediately bonded with his yellow lab, Frankie. \"From the moment I got her, it was amazing,\" he says. \"There was some beautiful moments in here that I shared with my puppy.\" Eventually, Frankie had to move on -- and Roberto had to say goodbye. \"The first night I was without Frankie, I have to say it was a long night,\" he says. \"It was hard for me to realize that the next morning I was going to wake up and not actually feed her that morning.\" Since leaving Roberto, Frankie has become a lifeline for Sgt. Allen Hill, who suffers from traumatic brain injury and severe combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder after he was hit by a roadside bomb in Iraq. Frankie helps Sgt. Hill overcome his paralyzing, violent flashbacks by kissing his face. After a few months together, Sgt. Hill and Frankie return to Fishkill to meet Roberto. When Frankie sees Roberto, she takes off running. \"She looks beautiful,\" Roberto says. Sgt. Hill thanks Roberto for all that he's done. \"Frankie has been there for me. She's been my rock when I've needed her to help me out with a flashback or a nightmare. I can do things that for a year and a half I couldn't do,\" Sgt. Hill says. Roberto is moved. \"This is an overwhelming feeling, and to see you is breathtaking,\" he says. \"And to see what Frankie had done in your life.\" Oprah.com: Animals that are working hard every day . Now paroled, Roberto is expected to be released from prison this summer, but what he learned from Puppies Behind Bars will stay with him forever. \"Being able to be involved in the puppy program has taught me to be a responsible person,\" he says. \"It has taught me patience.\" Sgt. Hill, his wife, Gina, say Frankie has changed their lives. \"The biggest difference that Frankie has made in my life was, one, she allowed me the opportunity to go back to church,\" he says. \"And, two, she's helping me gain my independence back so I'm not so reliant on Gina and other family members.\" Gina says she's starting to see her husband's playful, energetic side come through once again. \"We're starting to see that side of him again that we haven't seen in the year and a half he's been home from Iraq,\" she says. \"Frankie has brought my sons their daddy home. She has lit the light back in him that had been so dark.\" Perhaps the greatest legacy of Puppies Behind Bars is the lesson of love each inmate learns. Jesse, another prisoner at the Fishkill Correctional Facility, is currently training Joy, his third dog. \"She brought forth in me the ability to love again. It had been so dormant in me for so long because of the cold place that I'm in,\" he says. \"I didn't know that I could love again, and we all get to see how greatly these dogs affect the lives of the people that they touch.\" From The Oprah Winfrey Show  2009 .

    "input": "(CNN) -- For nearly 20 years Jennifer Schuett has held onto every memory of the night she was abducted from her bedroom, raped and left for dead. Jennifer Schuett remembers small details of the night she was abducted, raped and her throat slashed at age 8. It was August 10, 1990. Schuett was 8 years old and lived alone with her mother in the first floor of an apartment complex in Dickinson, Texas. The bedroom windows faced the parking lot. Investigators were never able to identify a suspect, but new DNA testing may change that. CNN normally does not identify victims of sexual assaults. But Schuett wants to go public with her story-- and her name-- to increase the chances of finding and prosecuting her attacker. \"It's not about me anymore,\" she explained. \"It's about all the little girls that go to sleep at night. I know there are so many girls out there who have been raped and hurt. You have to fight back.\" For that, Schuett, 27, is relying on her voice, her memory and advances in DNA testing. \"I remember everything; I've always wanted to remember everything, so I can find the person that did this,\" Schuett told CNN during a phone interview. \"If I had blocked this out of my memory, the investigation wouldn't have come this far. I'm a fighter.\" Schuett says she was alone in her bed when a man came creeping in through the window. She remembers waking up in a stranger's arms as he carried her across a dark parking lot. \"When I opened my eyes, his face was the first thing I saw and he covered my face and mouth,\" she said. \"He ran with me to his car. He told me he was an undercover cop and that he knew my family. He seemed calm -- not nervous, not aggressive.\" After they left the parking lot, he drove her through the streets of Dickinson, Texas, pulling into a mechanic shop next to her elementary school. \"Watch the moon. The moon will change colors and that is when your mom will come to get you,\" she recalled him saying. \"Oh, it looks like she is not coming.\" Schuett said he drove her to an overgrown field next to the school and raped her. \"He had a knife to my throat and touched my face and offered me Reese's pieces,\" she said. \"I was scared but I knew I couldn't be fast enough to get away. Cars would drive by but I couldn't get away to get help.\" She believes she passed out. \"I woke up to him dragging me by my ankles,\" she said. \"I felt thorns ripping the skin off my back. I would see him turn to look at me and I would play dead.\" She passed out again, and awoke at daybreak. \"I remember feeling dew around me and I couldn't figure out why when I screamed I couldn't hear myself,\" said Schuett. She lay naked on top of an ant hill with her throat slashed from ear to ear, and her voice box torn. Much later, she said, \"I heard children playing hide and seek. That is when one of the kids tripped over my foot,\" said Schuett. She was found at 6 p.m. on a hot August day. She had been lying in the field for nearly 12 hours. She was rushed to the hospital in critical condition. \"Three days after the attack, I started giving a description. The doctors told me I would never be able to talk again, but I proved them all wrong,\" said Schuett. She believes she got her voice back so she could tell her story. \"I never wanted to play the victim role. I wanted to be a strong survivor,\" she said. But the attack left its mark. \"For the first two years, I had nightmares and was scared,\" she said. \"But I never wanted sympathy. ... If I had given up, he would have won, and I wanted to show him: 'You didn't win.' \" Shuettt said she is now \"on a manhunt.\" Houston FBI Special Agent Richard Rennison is one of the lead investigators in the case, along with Dickinson police Detective Tim Cromie. Both men were discussing the case, when Rennison received a memo from the FBI's Child Abduction Rapid Deployment (CARD) Team, saying they were looking for cold child abduction cases that could be retested for DNA evidence. The Schuett case was one of the cases selected. Rennison, who has 10 years of experience in child abduction cases, said he has never seen a case like Schuett's. \"This is the only one that I can think of that the victim has suffered some traumatic injuries and survived,\" he said, \"The main reason the CARD team picked this case was because she was alive. In cases of child abduction it is rare that the child is recovered alive. Frequently you recover a body and most times you never find them.\" Schuett is a living witness who can help put the pieces together. The investigators found evidence collected 19 years ago, which can be retested. It includes the underwear and pajamas Schuett was wearing, as well as a man's underwear and T-shirt, which were found in the field where Schuett was left for dead. The clothes were tested in 1990, but the sample wasn't large enough for conclusive results. But now, modern techniques allow DNA to be isolated from a single human cell. Once they get back the DNA results -- \"any time now,\" Schuett said -- they will run them through the FBI's criminal database and see if they get a match. The FBI has also offered a $10,000 reward for information that could lead to a break in the case. And last weekend Schuett appeared in \"America's Most Wanted,\" which resulted in several leads from viewers who called in with information. \"Someone might remember something about that night,\" Schuett said. \"Dickinson is a really small community. Everybody knows everybody. I know someone in town knows something.\"",

    "input": "HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- Setting one species up to scare off or even kill another is nothing new. One of the world's most fearsome killers? Me? The heart-stoppingly infamous cane toad. Toads, bees, mongoose and even moths have all been utilized with varying degrees of success over the years in the hope that they could do the job humans couldn't. Sometimes it works, frequently it doesn't, and in some cases we are still waiting to find out. If any of these following examples teaches us anything at all, it is that if you are going to play with Nature, you do so at your own peril. Click here for gallery Â» . The Cane Toad . Who would have thought a humble toad could end up as the killer of one of the world's most fearsome creatures, the crocodile? It all started off so innocently, too. Introduced to Australia in 1935 from Hawaii, the cane toad, which is native to Central and South America, was supposed to kill off the scarab beetles that were decimating Australian sugarcane crops. Unfortunately, the toads failed to go after the beetles and decided to multiply at a very fast rate instead (they can lay between 8,000 and 30,000 eggs in one go) ending up as another pest the Australians were keen to see the back of. According to the Australian Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH), the cane toad \"expanded through Australia's northern landscape at 27-50 kilometers a year\" and is now heading south at a rate of 1.3 kilometers a year. Cane toads not only eat pretty much anything that can fit in their mouths, but as of yet, no known predators or diseases have been identified that can take them on. The problem is that they are extremely toxic, with the DEH stating \"almost anything that eats the toad dies rapidly from heart failure\". And that includes crocodiles. According to the University of Sydney, crocodile populations that have come across these new pests have been dropping like flies, in some places by as much as 77 percent. Small Indian mongoose . The risk with hired killers is that sometimes they can be a bit too good at their job. Such is the case with the small Indian mongoose, which was introduced into Hawaii and some of its surrounding islands in 1883. The idea was the mongoose, a \"voracious and opportunistic predator,\" according to Columbia University, would keep rats out of the sugarcane fields, where they had been feasting on what was on offer. The mongooses came in and missed out on the rats, as the former happened to be day-lovers, while the latter was nocturnal. So they turned their attention to other species instead, including birds (specifically ground nesters), small mammals and reptiles (they particularly liked snakes and iguanas). Little did the Hawaiians know at the time, but the small Indian mongoose is one of the world's most fearsome killers, now listed by the World Conservation Union in the top 100 of the world's worst invaders. These tiny creatures have hunted several species to extinction, including, says Columbia University, at least seven types of amphibians and reptiles in the West Indies; and in Jamaica alone it has been responsible for the extinction of a lizard, a snake, a rat and two birds. In Hawaii, the endangered Hawaiian crow, the endangered dark-rumped petrel and the nene goose are now all at risk, thanks to the appetite of this tiny, furry creature. And to make matters worse, this particular mongoose is a vector for rabies too. The English sparrow . The early bird catches the worm, but if that bird is an English sparrow, it does a little more than that, as the Americans found out in 1850. It was then that the bird was intentionally introduced to the U.S. as a means of protecting trees from canker worms. But according to Cornell University, the sparrow also set about feasting on crops as well. The sparrow had a very varied appetite, feeding on wheat, oats, corn and barley, pretty much any vegetable or fruit it laid its eyes on and it had a taste for chicken feed too. Surprisingly for its size, the sparrow is also a fairly aggressive creature and proved a bit of a bully to the locals, \"displacing some native birds and harassing others\", says Cornell. To add insult to injury, it carried 29 diseases that infected both humans and livestock. While U.S. populations are now largely on the decline, according to the Global Invasive Species Database, Australia meanwhile is on high alert, with the bird now having been assigned as \"an extreme threat category\" there. The red Fox . Australia has an unenviable claim to fame: it is home to the most number of mammal extinctions in the world. According to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), nearly half of all mammals that have gone extinct in the last 200 years, have been Australian. And much of the responsibility for these extinctions rests on the shoulders of introduced predators like the red fox. Just on its own the red fox could be responsible for \"dozens of small mammal extinctions\" in the country, according to Columbia University. The English brought the red fox with them to the country in 1855, not only introducing it for a spot of hunting, but also, it is thought, to control the brown hare populations. Unfortunately, the red fox was an excellent predator but it liked chasing after more types of creatures than just the brown hare. It had a ball, as Australian wildlife just wasn't equipped to deal with it. As a result, it freely preyed on birds, mammals of varying sizes and reptiles. It particularly seemed to like newborn lambs, goat kids and chickens, creating an economic headache for local farmers. And it didn't take them too long to spread either -- according to Australia's DEH, it took the red fox just 100 years to inhabit almost the entire continent. A natural scavenger, the red fox is incredibly adaptable too, which has meant not only has it proliferated on a massive scale, but with the absence of any real predators to speak of, they have proven very difficult indeed to kill. The European red fox is often described as Australia's number one predator; and as its also a \"key carrier of rabies\", says Columbia, the red fox is up there amongst Australia's most unwelcome guests.

Still reeling from the massive demonstration that followed the country's disputed presidential election, Iran on Wednesday will commemorate November 4, 1979, when a group of Islamist students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 53 hostages and effectively ending diplomatic relations with the United States. While the government will allow the \"faithful\" to celebrate the anniversary of the embassy seizure, those who \"intend to gather illegally and spread lies among people who gather to peacefully participate ... will be held responsible for their actions,\" said Ahmad Reza Radan, head of Iran's security forces, according to the semi-official Iran Student Correspondent Association. The government of Iran arrested more than 1,000 people in a massive crackdown after the June 12 election, in which incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the overwhelming winner. In the aftermath of the fallout, the government accused several reformists, including opposition candidates Mehdi Karrubi and Mir Hossein Moussavi, of spreading anti-government propaganda and fueling the anger among the public. Despite warnings from Iran's hardline leaders, the reformists have largely refused to back down. They released the names of 72 protesters they say were killed in the unrest that followed the election -- more than double the government's official number. Karrubi, a former parliamentary speaker, has been especially vocal about the claims of detainee rape. He publishing a firsthand account of one alleged victim on his Web site last month. He has been scorned by government hard-liners, whose credibility and legitimacy have been publicly questioned since the elections. On Wednesday, Islamic authorities tried to pre-emptively silence anti-government demonstrations and rhetoric. According to the Islamic Republic News Agency, Hossein Sajedinia, deputy of operations for Iran's security forces, said, \"The police will not allow a handful [of individuals] to disrupt the organization and safety of this day, by fooling people and the youth.\"",

Passengers walk past firefighters at a Green Line station in Boston after the trolley collision Friday evening. The trolley driver has told investigators he was text messaging during Friday night's collision, which injured 20 people. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which previously had banned operators from using cell phones and other portable devices, now has told employees to leave the devices at home while on duty, National Transportation Safety Board member Debbie Hersman said Monday. Hersman also noted investigators have determined that the operator may have missed some crucial indications of a stopped trolley ahead on the tracks.  Watch new transit rule on cell phones Â» . \"There were several signals -- two green signals, a yellow signal and a red signal -- coming out of the station, and the point of collision occurred 80 feet past that red signal,\" Hersman said. \"We did a site-distance test, and we know that the operator had the ability to see the trolley stopped in front of him 480 feet in advance of the collision.\" Boston officials said over the weekend that the trolley operator was using his cell phone. Numerous media outlets, including CNN's Boston affiliates, have identified the driver as 24-year-old Aiden Quinn. \"The operator of the striking train was interviewed at the hospital by two detectives,\" said MBTA general manager Daniel Grabauskas. \"He admitted that he was texting at the time of the accident.\" The operator told detectives that, when he looked up, \"it was too late as he applied the brake and the train struck the other trolley,\" Grabauskas said. He described himself as \"outraged.\" \"We have reinforced for a number of years that the use of cell phones or any other kinds of electronic devices while operating a train or a bus is absolutely prohibited,\" Grabauskas said. Though the investigation is ongoing, he said, the two-year employee will be fired if his version of events is confirmed. None of the injuries was considered life-threatening, the MBTA said. The collision happened at 7:18 p.m. ET Friday as the Green Line trains were traveling between the Park Street and Government Center stations in downtown Boston. Both trains were traveling westbound when one train rear-ended the second, an MBTA official said. A train operator also was text messaging last year in a California train crash that killed 25 people.

    "input": "(CNN)  -- Holders Brazil needed a last-gasp equalizer from Fred to salvage a 2-2 draw against Paraguay in their Copa America Group B match Saturday in Cordoba. It was another lackluster performance from the five-time world champions after being held to a goalless draw by Venezuela in the opening match of their title defense. They took a first half lead through Jadson, but trailed 2-1 with only a minute left when substitute Fred spared their blushes. Jadson replaced Robinho in the starting line up as Brazil coach Mano Menezes rung the changes after the disappointing performance against Venezuela. The Shakhtar Donetsk midfielder repaid that confidence with a fine strike six minutes before halftime in the Mario Kempes stadium. But Paraguay, themselves held by Ecuador in their opener, leveled 11 minutes into the second half through Blackburn striker Roque Santa Cruz. Paraguay then took a shock lead with Dani Alvez losing the ball to Santa Cruz, who found Haedo Valdez. He scored with a deflected shot and a real upset looked on the cards. But Menezes replaced Neymar with Fred and he struck at the death to grab a point for the favorites. The start of the 12-team tournament has been marked by sub-par displays from hosts Argentina and Brazil, with both still looking for a victory after two games apiece. The top two teams from each of three groups of four qualify for the quarterfinals with the two third-placed teams with the best record.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Unlike NBC, other TV networks aren't hoping to attract more than 200 million viewers as the London Olympics unfolds throughout the next 16 days. That said, they're certainly not going to make the ratings game any easier on the National Broadcasting Company, which reportedly shelled out $1.18 billion for the U.S. rights to air the games. (That's about $286 million more than they paid in 2008.) \"One of TV's first great reality shows,\" the Olympics used to be one of the few original programs to air during the summer, said Ron Simon, a curator at the Paley Center for Media. Back then, there was hardly any effort to counter program. Now, with competition shows such as CBS's \"Big Brother,\" ABC's \"Bachelor Pad\" and Fox's \"So You Think You Can Dance\" -- not to mention scripted cable dramas such as \"Burn Notice\" and \"The Closer\" that often pull in up to 6 million viewers -- other networks could likely draw a substantial audience during the Olympics. It can be challenging for any series to go up against the Olympics, Simon said, but \"there is the possibility that if there's not compelling storylines for the Olympics, there are some real interesting shows out there (for people to watch).\" One thing is for sure: Cable TV isn't holding back. Beloved dramas such as AMC's \"Breaking Bad,\" TNT's \"The Closer\" and DirecTV's \"Damages,\" which have all embarked on their final seasons, are surely hoping for steady ratings throughout the games. \"Cable is going about business as usual,\" said Robert J. Thompson, the founding director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University. \"There are a lot of table scraps to be gotten.\" The No. 1 reason broadcast networks \"don't want to completely roll over and play dead during the Olympics,\" Thompson said, is because they have schedules they want to promote for fall. This is a really important time for networks to be promoting new shows, he said, which is why NBC plans to premiere pilot episodes for \"Go On\" and \"Animal Practice\" directly after Olympic coverage on August 8 and 12, respectively. \"The real value of the Olympics is to use it as a venue to promote the upcoming season,\" Thompson said. In total, 211 million viewers in the U.S. tuned in to the 2008 Beijing Olympics (with about 27 million people tuning in each day), making it the most-viewed TV event to date, according to Nielsen Media Research. But that's not always the case. Between viewers' fascination with Beijing, the \"magical\" opening ceremony and compelling personal storylines, the 2008 games had a lot going for it, Simon said. \"It goes back to the old network formula,\" Simon added. \"You need the compelling personality and the storylines. And that sort of has to develop. Obviously four years ago, there were great numbers because of one person, Michael Phelps, and the series of events and expectations around him.\" It's too early to tell if subsequent plots -- such as Phelps becoming the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time or Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt's record 100- and 200-meter dash times -- will develop at the London Games. Though there's already a good deal of buzz surrounding athletes such as 17-year-old swimmer Missy Franklin and 16-year-old gymnast Gabby Douglas. \"Both Bolt and Phelps are back, but they're sort of not what they once were,\" Simon said. \"You're going to have to look for other people that not only are fantastic within their individual sports, but that can create that storyline.\" Even NBC seems unsure of what to expect, given the network's conflicting statements regarding its expectations. \"I know this is going to stun you, but I think these Olympics will be huge,\" Alan Wurtzel, NBC's president of research, said in a conference call with reporters via The Salt Lake Tribune. \"Without question, they're going to dominate 17 nights of prime time. I believe they will rank in the Top Five of the most-watched events in television history, with north of 200 million viewers.\" Meanwhile, NBC Sports Group Chairman Mark Lazarus said at a June news conference, via Forbes: \"I would love to match those scenarios, though it's unlikely. We are not measuring ourselves against Beijing.\" Despite garnering respectable ratings during the U.S. trials, it's difficult to predict how many people will tune in once the Olympics are underway. And while NBC will likely take home a gold medal in the ratings game, other networks shouldn't be counted out of the games.",

    "input": "Editor's Note: Jack R. Nerad is Executive Editorial Director for Kelley Blue Book and kbb.com, and co-host of \"America on the Road,\" heard on more than 300 radio stations. In the 1980s he served as Editor of Motor Trend magazine. Nerad is the author of \"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Hybrid and Alternative Fuel Vehicles,\" published recently by Alpha Books. Jack Nerad says bankruptcy would drive car buyers away from GM and imperil suppliers. (CNN) -- The events of the past week have been unprecedented in the auto industry and in the annals of American business. As the events have unfolded, there is the strong implication from the administration's automotive task force that Chapter 11 bankruptcy, followed by restructuring and \"cleansing\" of General Motors' balance sheet, is a potential scenario in the ongoing efforts to keep the giant automaker alive. GM's new chief executive, Fritz Henderson, acknowledged as much on CNN Sunday. \"You can't rule options off the table. So you basically say we will spend time to try to get it [done] outside of bankruptcy. But if we can't, we're not going to compromise our goals. We're going to get it done inside our bankruptcy. Our preferred approach is still to do it outside, but you can't rule out going in.\" Over the past few weeks pundits of all stripes have appeared on financial news networks suggesting that entering Chapter 11 is GM's only way to future viability. \"Get on with it,\" they say, and save us the agony. It is the only way, they argue, General Motors can get relief from its immediate cash-flow issues, tear up or substantially modify its union contracts, dump unnecessary brands, close plants and \"right-size\" its operations. But those pundits who propose Chapter 11 fail to acknowledge that General Motors is a consumer-facing company whose success or failure is in the hands of millions of average Americans. This group will decide to buy or not buy General Motors vehicles based on what they know, hear and even feel about GM's future. As talk of imminent bankruptcy swirls in the press, the news they hear about General Motors certainly is not reassuring, as they consider which brand to buy. How does that manifest itself in the car-buying public? We at Kelley Blue Book asked 500 potential new-vehicle buyers a string of related questions that yield answers to that multi-billion dollar question. Their response is telling. Asked \"How likely would you be to buy a car from General Motors if they were to go bankrupt,\" 42.1 percent of new-vehicle buyers said they were either \"not at all likely\" or \"not very likely\" to do so. Even with a warranty guarantee from the federal government, consumers are not very enthusiastic about considering a GM purchase. Such a guarantee only moves the needle about three percentage points with 39.8 percent saying they were either \"not at all likely\" or \"not very likely\" to purchase a GM vehicle in such a situation. Asked, \"How likely would you be to buy a car from General Motors if they were allowed to keep operating but had to renegotiate their contracts and agreements with suppliers and laborers?\" the responses changed. Given that scenario, only 31.6 percent of new-vehicle buyers said they were either \"not at all likely\" or \"not very likely\" to purchase a GM vehicle, and they were out-numbered by the 41.5 percent who said they were either \"very likely\" or \"extremely likely\" to do so. While one must keep in mind that consumers don't always do what they say they are going to do, the import of this is clear: Bankruptcy puts a damper on consumer confidence and vehicle demand. There are other reasons to question the wisdom of a Chapter 11 filing as well. Beyond its potentially chilling effect on consumer demand, there is a domino effect on the supplier community. Many GM vendors have operated for years on ever-declining, razor-thin margins and are heavily dependent on GM for cash-flow. If that cash-flow ceases for even a relatively short period of time it could well send many of those suppliers into bankruptcy and force others simply to close their doors. The likely bankruptcies of supplier companies would have a ripple effect through the entire American vehicle manufacturing industry, causing hardships for the healthier companies as well. Further, while a \"quick-cleanse\" bankruptcy is contemplated, it is very difficult to imagine that the Chapter 11 bankruptcy of one of the largest industrial companies in the world would not take a year or more to unravel, rather than weeks or months. And if GM languishes in bankruptcy it is hard to imagine consumers flocking to buy its new vehicles. Nor is it likely the government would subsidize those operations through the potentially lengthy proceedings. The implications of the pronouncements made by President Obama and the auto industry task force indicate clearly that they believe a figurative hammer is needed to move the stakeholders -- the United Auto Workers union, pensioners, bondholders and creditors -- to accept settlements that are, at best, unpalatable to them. The threat of bankruptcy is that hammer. But the question should be asked: Is the hammer the task force is holding over the head of the GM stakeholders in an effort to get concessions, the same hammer that will drive away consumers and require the federal government to make larger and larger cash infusions or see GM founder?

    "input": "(CNN) -- Tourists visiting an Egyptian resort have been warned to be alert after a series of shark attacks that have left one woman dead and several people seriously injured. The German woman died Sunday after being attacked by a shark in waters off Sharm el-Sheikh, prompting Egypt's tourism ministry to close the beach until the animal responsible is found. Thousands of tourists flock to Sharm el-Sheikh each year, attracted by its warm climate and clear waters, but the UK Foreign Office on Monday amended its travel advice for people visiting the area. A statement on its website read: \"Attacks by oceanic white tip sharks are extremely rare and shark attacks of any kind are very unusual in the Red Sea. \"If you are considering diving or snorkelling in any of the Red Sea resorts be aware that safety standards of diving operators can vary considerably. \"A basic rule is never to dive or snorkel unaccompanied. Where possible make any bookings through your tour representative. \"Unusually cheap operators may not provide adequate safety and insurance standards.\" Tour operators Thomson and First Choice also warned holiday-makers about the shark attacks. \"We are treating the situation very seriously and are advising all of our customers not to swim in the sea at Sharm el-Sheikh,\" a statement said. \"We have also cancelled all water-based excursions until further notice.\" After the attacks authorities ordered people to stay out of the water around Sharm el-Sheikh. On Thursday, the Environment Ministry said two sharks suspected of the maulings were caught. Jochen Van Lysebettens, general operations manager of the Red Sea Diving College in Sharm el-Sheikh, said employees at the Hyatt Regency resort told him the attack happened about noon (5 a.m. ET) in a protected swim area off the resort. Van Lysebettens has three dive-instruction operations in the area, including one at the Hyatt Regency. The 70-year-old woman, a regular guest at the resort, was snorkeling near a reef when she was attacked, he said. She called for help, and a lifeguard brought her to shore, but she had lost too much blood and resuscitation efforts failed, Van Lysebettens said. The woman's arm and leg were severed, he said. A British tourist described witnessing one of the shark attacks. Ellen Barnes, 31, of Horsham, West Sussex, told The Sun newspaper: \"The water was churning like I was in a washing machine. I was being thrown around in the blood.\" After the Sunday incident, the Chamber of Diving and Watersports called on its members in the region \"to stop any snorkeling activities happening from any boats or shore.\" The chamber is under the umbrella of the Egyptian Tourist Federation. Van Lysebettens said all tourists were ordered to stay out of the water at least through Monday. The dive community is organizing volunteer expeditions to find the shark, he said, and about 40 people will search Monday. On Friday, two sharks were caught and killed near the South Sinai National Park on the Sharm el-Sheikh coast, according to the Chamber of Diving and Watersports. The chamber said that as of Friday, the condition of three injured snorkelers -- two Russian women and a man from the Ukraine -- were unchanged. One of them was critical, the chamber said in a statement, but did not say which one. The three were attacked in a 24-hour period November 30 and December 1, the chamber said. Van Lysebettens said he is not a marine biologist, but many have speculated an oceanic white-tipped shark was responsible for the German woman's death, as well as the other attacks. Divers are upset because the two sharks killed Friday are thought to be innocent. They were a mako shark and another oceanic white-tipped shark -- which did not match pictures taken by someone accompanying one of the injured snorkelers, he said. Officials at the national park did not provide details on \"why the animals could not be relocated to remote waters as was previously suggested,\" the chamber's statement said, adding it \"does not wish to see any harm to any further sharks.\" Exploratory dives were taking place on Friday, Van Lysebettens said. Officials are not sure what triggered the feeding behavior, described as highly unusual. \"This incident has clearly shocked our community, and the CDWS is continuing its investigation into why this may have happened,\" Hesham Gabr, head of the Chamber of Diving and Watersports, said in the statement. \"It is clear from our initial discussions with shark behavioral experts that this highly unusual spate of attacks by an oceanic white tip shark was triggered by an activity, most probably illegal fishing or feeding in the area.\" Several divers in the area saw carcasses of dead sheep in the water last week, Van Lysebettens said. It's not known how they got there, he said, but they could have washed out to sea or fallen off a boat. The shark may have been attracted by the carcass, he said, and could now be attacking slow-moving things on the water's surface. CNN's Brian Walker and Karen Smith contributed to this report.",

    "input": "London (CNN) -- Tensions between police and marauding gangs continued into Tuesday in areas of Great Britain, after violence initially sparked by the shooting death of a 29-year-old man in London spread to other parts of the nation. The number of people arrested in London since the violence began has risen to 334, police said Tuesday. During the overnight hours, standoffs continued at several locations in London as police in riot gear warily watched roaming gangs often just yards away. A bus in Ealing, West London, a bus was vandalized and set on fire, while the driver was still on board. He escaped without injury. There was evidence of vandalism in central London, with visible damage to a number of shops. The developments come as reports flowed in from other parts of the country that outbreaks of violence and vandalism had occurred. In Bristol, in southwest England, police said several shops and vehicles were damaged Monday night and \"a number of main roads have been closed to allow officers to take control of what is currently a volatile situation.\" \"Officers are urging people to avoid the city centre at this time. People already in the city centre should leave the area and go home,\" Bristol police said in a statement early Tuesday. Street disturbances appeared to have spread to Birmingham, about 120 miles north of London, where police said \"several premises\" in the city center had been attacked \"with some shop windows smashed and property stolen in various locations.\" A police statement issued early Tuesday said about 100 people had been arrested in Birmingham and added there were no reports of \"major injuries of member of the public or police officers as a result of the disorder.\" Disturbances also were reported in the Liverpool area, about 180 miles northwest of London, with police there saying officers had responded to \"reports of vehicles on fire and criminal damage\" in south Liverpool. The office of British Prime Minister David Cameron announced that Cameron would return to London Monday night, cutting short a vacation in Italy, for meetings to discuss the violence. As disturbances and looting flared in various parts of London, an official from the London Fire Brigade told CNN: \"We are too busy now to take any calls from the media.\" Police reported \"fires burning at a number of premises including a very large blaze at a sofa factory\" in the south London borough of Croydon. In the Hackney area of east London, gangs attacked a police car and shops. Video showed riot police involved in skirmishes, youths destroying a police car, smashing shop windows, a sporting goods shop being looted and the window of another shop being smashed. Police said in a statement that a crowd of between 250 and 300 people gathered, with those in the crowd throwing \"petrol bombs\" and setting cars ablaze. In Lewisham in south London, a car was set afire. \"This is just thugs wanting to intimidate people,\" Councillor Michael Harris told the BBC. \"We've had good community relations in Lewisham and it's simply not justified.\" He described the people carrying out the acts as young people whose faces were covered with masks. Several hundred people in the center of Peckham in South London threw projectiles -- stones, clay pots and bottles -- with one policeman saying, \"they raided the bottle bank,\" CNN's Dan Rivers reported from the scene. Large numbers of them, many with faces covered by shirts and bandannas, rushed back and forth with police -- in far fewer numbers -- standing their ground at the entrances to roads, Rivers said. Police created a cordon around Clapham Junction, one of London's busiest train stations, with trains unable to go to or from the station. There was no obvious sign of violence at the station but a policewoman told CNN it was not safe for people to go near the station. The policewoman did not explain why. The violence started in the ethnically diverse, working-class suburb north of London's center whose residents are predominantly Afro-Caribbean. Saturday's riots occurred after the shooting death Thursday of Mark Duggan, a black man, as he was seated inside a cab. Officers from Operation Trident -- the Metropolitan Police unit that deals with gun crime in London's black communities -- stopped the cab during an attempted arrest and soon afterward shots were fired, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) said. Duggan, a father of four, was fatally shot. Shooting deaths are rare in England. The commission divulged neither who shot Duggan nor why police had stopped the cab, with the incident still under investigation. Some reports suggested that Duggan was held down by police and shot in the head, but the IPCC has denied this. \"Speculation that Mark Duggan was 'assassinated' in an execution style involving a number of shots to the head are categorically untrue,\" the IPCC said in a statement. A British police watchdog group said evidence from Thursday's shooting scene, including a nonpolice firearm, was to undergo forensic testing. The man's family and friends, who blamed police for the death, gathered Saturday night outside the Tottenham police station to protest. The protest began peacefully but soon devolved into riots as demonstrators -- whose numbers included whites and blacks -- tossed petrol bombs, looted stores and burned police cars. The unrest prompted Home Secretary Theresa May to cut short her summer vacation and return Monday afternoon to London. In all, 35 police officers have been injured since the violence broke out, Metropolitan Police said. On Monday morning, residents in the South London neighborhood of Brixton awoke to see the aftermath of Sunday night's sporadic shooting in the commercial center. A KFC's windows were smashed, a Foot Locker store was burned, and the main street was closed as police investigators combed through the area looking for evidence. Police said they were reviewing closed-circuit television footage in an attempt to identify looters. Looting also occurred in pockets of Enfield, next to Tottenham, in north London. \"The scenes of violence and destruction over the weekend are utterly appalling,\" said London Mayor Boris Johnson, in a statement. \"People have lost their homes, businesses and livelihoods through mindless violence. I understand the need for urgent answers into the shooting incident that resulted in the death of a young local man, and I've sought reassurances that the IPCC are doing exactly that. But let's be clear these acts of sheer criminality across London are nothing to do with this incident and must stop now.\" A representative of Johnson said Monday evening that he was cutting short his family holiday in North America to return to London. Police said the rioting and looting in other parts of the capital were \"copycat\" events conducted by opportunists and criminals. \"This is not about the black community and the police, it's about young people and the police,\" said Shaun Bailey, a youth worker, in a statement circulated by the mayor's office. \"And let's not beat around the bush and pretend this is some type of social justice protest -- it's sheer criminality.\" The specter that such violence could arise had been a concern to David Lammy long before the weekend. The Labour MP for Tottenham told a reporter in March that Tottenham could become a scene of violence as cuts to social-service programs for youths were implemented. \"It's heartbreaking,\" he told the Tottenham & Wood Green Journal. \"I'm really worried that the social experiment that we're seeing from the Tory-led coalition will lead to scenes akin to something that we see in some of the inner-city areas of America and that's why we need to bring this government down.\" But the leader of Enfield Council, Doug Taylor, was unmoved. \"There can be no justification for the violence and the looting,\" the Labour Party member told a reporter. Deputy Prime Minister Nicholas Clegg called the rioters \"opportunists -- cynical folks who are indulging in smash-and-grab criminality.\" Police say they have evidence that some of the rioting was coordinated using social media, including Twitter. Tottenham was the site of riots before. In 1985 Floyd Jarrett, who was of Afro-Caribbean origin, was stopped by police near the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham on suspicion of driving with a forged tax disc, a document all British vehicles must carry. A few hours later, officers raided the nearby home of his mother, who collapsed and died during the raid. Rioting erupted shortly afterwards. Like the current violence, a protest outside Tottenham Police Station sparked the 1985 conflict.

    "input": "Gore, Georgia (CNN) -- Duncan Shropshire stops at the edge of the treeline, where the meadow becomes a forest. His yellow linen shirt is misbuttoned and crooked, leaving the bottom of his belly slightly exposed. His 8-year-old daughter, Mia-Grace, stands a foot or so behind him, wiping her runny nose with the sleeve of her blue sweatshirt. After about a minute, she lets out a sigh of boredom. Shropshire, 51, clasps his daughter's hand and begins leading her into the Northwest Georgia forest. \"This is where your ancestors are buried, back here,\" Shropshire says. \"C'mon, I'll show you.\" And with a loving tug, Duncan Shropshire shares with his daughter a key piece of their family's history. Still holding hands, the pair weaves through the maze of thin pines, stepping over fallen oaks and basketball-sized sinkholes. Mia-Grace stays silent while her father seems singularly focused on moving forward. After five minutes, they reach a large clearing where rows of fist-sized rocks bulge out of the ground. Each rock sits atop small depressions in the ground. \"You see those humps in the ground?\" Shropshire asks. \"Uh-huh,\" Mia-Grace replies. \"Those are rows of graves. They're stacked like spoons here,\" Shropshire says. \"There was a lot of people here. People of the 1800s are buried here. And I'm trying to keep it in your memory the way granddaddy kept it in mine so it won't be forgotten.\" The two crouch over a large, flat rock with the words \"Lewis Dickson, 4\" scratched into it. To the left of the marker is a row of 12 rocks. To the front, there are four other rows of stones, varying in number. \"How long did they bury our kin here?\" Mia-Grace asks. \"They started in the early 1800s, baby,\" Shropshire answers. \"They worked our people to death here. They were slaves. And probably about 1905 is when they stopped burying in this area. Your great-great-great grandfather, a (slave-owning) man named Wesley, he had five children by this slave woman, your great-great-great grandmother. She is buried over here on this side. Her name is Molly.\" Mia-Grace's light green eyes get big. \"I'm worried I might step on them,\" she says. \"Oh, baby,\" Shropshire says with a laugh, \"they're gone. They're gone! They're sleeping right now, waiting for the Lord to come.\" A \"rare\" and \"special\" place . The Shropshire gravesite is in the Appalachian foothills outside Gore, Georgia. About 1,000 feet from the clearing is an old, abandoned church on a dusty dirt road. Experts say that if slaves or former slaves are buried at the site, it would be a unique archeological find. \"In Appalachia, it would be extremely rare to have a black or slave graveyard,\" explained Ruth Little, co-author of \"Sticks and Stones: Three Centuries of North Carolina Gravemarkers.\" \"The farms in Appalachia were small, and there were fewer slaves.\" Little says slave cemeteries in the area would have been marked with field stones, like the rocks at the site, or wooden stakes that burned down. \"It's very regional and very local,\" Little continued. \"I've seen on the coastal area with graves marked with seashells.\" Other grave markers used in black burial cites throughout the Southeast include iron pipes, broken dishes, cups, bottles and live cedar trees, according to Chicora Foundation Executive Director Michael Trinkley. He specializes in cemetery preservation. \"The problem with preserving these types of sites is that African-American cemeteries are hard to find,\" Trinkley said. \"You can think of the people buried there as the invisible dead. And not knowing where they are, or how many there are, makes them susceptible to loss.\" Even if gravesites are recognized, they still might be destroyed for development. Trinkley points to the low country of South Carolina. \"The areas that were used for burial grounds,\" Trinkley explained, \"those areas were close to water. They were considered waste areas, places where burying slaves wasn't a significant loss to the planter. Those areas today are among the most sought-after for real estate.\" Officials in Chattooga County, where the site is located, say that they are unaware of any grave sites in the hills near Gore and that the site needs to be registered with the library as a cemetery before it can be considered for protection through local ordinances. Trinkley and Little both say the potential historical importance of grave sites warrant investigation by local or state officials. \"What if in that grave was your mother or your child?\" Trinkley asked. \"It's an issue of respect and an issue of dignity. It's the last decision society and the individual make together.\" \"There aren't many traceable slave graveyards, and each one is special in it's own way,\" Little added. She says the Shropshire family can point to that spot and say, \"This is where we're from; this is where our roots are.\" Two cemeteries for two ancestors . Shortly before sunset, Mia-Grace and Duncan Shropshire head over to an old white cemetery about a mile from the forest gravesite. The dates on the gravestones suggest that it was used around the same time as the forest cemetery. There, Shropshire and Mia-Grace walk over to a marble headstone that tops 10 feet. In front of it is a small plastic Confederate flag flapping in the breeze. \"This is Wesley Weatherspoon Shropshire. ... He was one of the colonels in the Civil War for the Confederacy,\" Shropshire says. \"He had five children by way of a slave he owned by the name of Molly.\" \"My great-great grandmother?\" Mia-Grace asks. \"Your great-great-great grandmother,\" Shropshire corrects her. He turns to point toward another grave site when Mia-Grace notices her father's misbuttoned shirt. She stops him mid-sentence and begins to fix the crooked buttons. \"Why is Molly buried over there and Wesley over here?\" she asks. \"Because that's the way it was, Mia,\" Shropshire answers. Mia-Grace's face is filled with intense concentration as she tries to undo the bottom button on her father's shirt. Finally, she pries the button free. She looks up at her father and says assuredly, \"But people are people. It doesn't matter what they are. They're all the same.\" \"That's a good thing to think, but back then it wasn't like that, Mia,\" Shropshire tells her. \"The dark-skinned people were buried way back over yonder, and the light-skinned people were buried here.\" Mia-Grace finally fixes her father's shirt, leaving it straight. Then, she skips over to the other end of the cemetery. Shropshire watches her race across the lot. \"You can't do well in life if you don't know your history. Without your history, you're nothing,\" he says. Mia-Grace playfully hides behind a large headstone, calling for her daddy to chase her. A quarter-way toward her, he stops, turns around and yells back, \"I reckon she'll be buried wherever she wants to.\"",

    "input": "Freetown, Sierra Leone (CNN) -- Millions of people will breathe a sigh of relief that Charles Taylor has finally been held to account for the years of violence, misery and suffering that he brought to the people of West Africa. Taylor, a former president of Liberia, was found guilty after a lengthy trial by a special court sitting in The Hague for aiding and abetting rebels during the bloody conflict in Sierra Leone between 1996 and 2002. The violence in Sierra Leone shocked the world as thousands of civilians were caught up in the fighting. Limbs were hacked off as punishment, mass killings and gang rape were common and thousands of children were forced to fight or become sex slaves. The survivors still struggle with the mental and physical scars of their ordeals. Incredibly, despite the tens of thousands of cases of documented atrocities, only 13 people have been held to account for these crimes. And, under a 1999 amnesty agreement drawn up in a desperate bid to end the fighting, Taylor may be the last to stand trial for what happened. Everyone else -- his commanders and lieutenants and fighters on all sides -- remain free to go about their lives as if nothing happened. Taylor's conviction brings some measure of justice to the people of Sierra Leone, but it is only the first step in a long journey back to normalcy for the people. Years after the end of the war, people are still grappling with the challenges and the legacies of the violence. Since the Truth and Reconciliation Commission published its report in 2004, only a limited number of recommendations on reparations have been implemented. Without a long-term, sustainable plan and sufficient funds to assist survivors to rebuild their lives, many are begging in the streets for a living. Failing to prosecute the perpetrators of crimes under international law gives the impression that they will not have to face the consequences of their actions. It ignores the distress of the victims and creates a risk of further violations. The failure to address impunity weakens state institutions, denies human values and debases the whole of humanity. Prosecutions serve to clarify the truth about what happened, establish accountability for human rights abuses and contribute to building confidence in the rule of law. Without them, victims are left to suffer without official acknowledgment of the crimes committed against them or assistance to rebuild their lives. Although the initial prosecutions of Taylor and his cronies were restricted to those individuals considered to bear the \"greatest responsibility\" for crimes under international law, the government of Sierra Leone authorities must now move to hold others to account. It must rescind the 1999 amnesty and strengthen and build an independent criminal justice system so that further investigations and prosecutions can be made. Justice needs to go hand in hand with peace. In neighboring Liberia, similar violence between 1989-1996 and 1999-2003 saw countless attacks on civilians resulting in death, disfigurement and displacement. As in Sierra Leone, government and armed opposition groups used rape and other forms of sexual violence against women and girls as deliberate strategies, as a weapon of war and to instil terror. Women of all ages were victims, including very young girls and older women. It is estimated that as much as 60-70% of the population suffered some form of sexual violence during the conflict. By the end of the war in Liberia, more than 20,000 children were believed to be involved in the conflict. Both boys and girls were abducted and forced to fight, carry ammunition, prepare food or go to the front line. In many cases, child soldiers were forced to carry out killings, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, looting and abducted and forcibly recruiting other children. Currently, there are no plans for Liberian authorities to investigate the crimes under international law committed during the 14-year conflict. Instead, the people in Liberia are expected to forgive and forget the past and just move on. But, like the people of Sierra Leone, the victims of past human rights violations in Liberia have the right to know the truth, obtain justice and be granted full reparations for what they suffered. With similar investigations now under way involving grave crimes committed in northern Uganda, Darfur and the Democratic Republic of Congo, Taylor's conviction sends a signal that authorities are finally moving to end impunity, establish the rule of law, promote and encourage respect for human rights and restore and maintain international peace and security. But official moves to hold perpetrators to account must be transparent, comprehensive and fair. They must remember and involve the thousands of victims. And they must ensure that justice is done. Otherwise, those who committed some of the most egregious crimes imaginable are getting away with murder. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Brima Sheriff.",

    "input": "OMAHA, Nebraska (CNN)  -- Investigators probing the deadly mall shooting in Omaha have seized computers and are analyzing information on Web sites in the search for clues in the case, police said Thursday. The 19-year-old gunman sent at least one text message to his former girlfriend, with whom he broke up about two weeks ago, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said. Robert Hawkins also left a voice mail for his mother before killing eight people at a department store Wednesday. He chose his victims randomly, police believe, then took his own life. Hawkins visited a friend near the Westroads Mall before the shootings and apparently went directly to the shopping center after that meeting, Warren said. Police don't yet know why Hawkins chose the mall or the Von Maur department store in particular, Warren said, adding only that the teen \"may have frequented the Westroads Mall.\"  See who Hawkins killed in department store Â» . The incident itself appeared to be premeditated, as Hawkins left a suicide note and other correspondence, Warren said.  Watch officials detail the rampage Â» . \"Typically there are hints that something like this may take place,\" Warren said. \"Certainly you can't anticipate someone engaging in this type of shooter rampage, but if there is any justification, any explanation,\" police will find it, he said. \"Apparently he had been experiencing some mental health problems, ideations of suicide.\" Debora Maruca-Kovac -- a friend of Hawkins' family who was letting him live in her home -- found the suicide note just minutes before the shootings.  Watch her describe their last conversation Â» . \"He basically said how sorry he was for everything,\" she told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. \"He didn't want to be a burden to people and that he was a piece of s--- all of his life and that now he'd be famous.\" Warren said the rifle used was an AK-47. Police haven't finished tracing the gun, but believe Hawkins stole it from his stepfather's home. Security officers flagged Hawkins as suspicious when he entered the mall. He left soon after he entered, then returned less than six minutes later with something apparently hidden in a balled-up sweatshirt. He went up an elevator to the mall's third floor, then immediately began firing, ultimately turning the firearm on himself, Warren said. \"It doesn't appear as though there was an opportunity for intervention,\" Warren said. Hawkins fired more than 30 rounds, the police chief said. The shootings sent panicked holiday shoppers fleeing for cover. \"It was just so loud, and then it was silence,\" said witness Jennifer Kramer, who hid inside a circular clothing rack. \"I was scared to death he'd be walking around looking for someone else.\"  Watch how Kramer and her mother hid Â» . A friend of Hawkins' said he hadn't thought Hawkins was capable of such violence. \"He was the one guy, you know, if people would be getting in a fight he'd be trying to break it up,\" said Shawn Saunders, who had known Hawkins for about 2Â½ years. \"If there were arguments amongst our friends or groups, he was kind of like the calm, cool and collected one.\"  Watch how Saunders learned Hawkins was the shooter Â» . Nebraska Gov. Dave Heineman said Hawkins had been a ward of the state for nearly four years, but he did not specify in what capacity. The state's custody ended in August of last year, Heineman said. U.S. Army recruiters turned Hawkins down last summer when he tried to enlist, a source familiar with the situation said Thursday. The source didn't want to be named because it is against the military's rules to discuss potential recruits. The reason for his rejection was unclear. Heineman ordered that flags throughout the state be lowered to half-staff through Sunday. The dead include six store employees and two customers, ranging in age from 24 to 66. One store employee was in critical but stable condition Thursday and another had been upgraded from critical to serious, according to hospital officials. Another person was still being treated Thursday afternoon, Warren said, but he did not specify whether the individual was a customer or employee. Two other customers had been treated and released, he said. Westroads Mall remained closed Thursday, but the facility, including the Von Maur store, could reopen Friday. E-mail to a friend .

    "input": "(CNN) -- Basketball is often viewed as a game of opposing sides. But one man is using the game to bring young Catholic and Protestant men together on the same team in Belfast, Northern Ireland. After graduating college, Michael Evans coached basketball at two high schools in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Former college basketball player, Michael Evans, 26, in partnership with another basketball player, Dave Cullen, created the organization Full Court Peace to help forge friendships between between schools in the divided communities. He spoke with CNN's Nicole Lapin about how Full Court Peace works. The following is an edited transcript of the interview. Lapin: So you wanted to use basketball as a bridge but you started Full Court Peace almost to dupe these youngsters into working together? Evans: Yea that's one way to put it. I think what I did was I just coached basketball separately in two high schools. And, uh, on the opposite sides of these walls I've been talking about. And I got roughly five on each side to latch on to me. These 16-year-old boys. You know, they came from broken homes and I showed them loyalty. That's what coaches do, is show their players loyalty and the kids latched on to me, so much that I was able to sell the idea of making an integrated team out of their enemies and it was a complete success.  Watch more on Michael Evan's organization Â» . Lapin: They didn't think that they were going to work with the other side. Like Robert, for example, one of your players who is Protestant. What did he think when he was going to work with a Catholic team? Evans:That was a pretty discouraging moment throughout the whole process of forming that team. I told Robert the news and he shunned me. He couldn't believe that the time I'd spent with him alone was really just basically me trying to convince him to join this team. I thought I might have lost him. Lapin:  Now he's also friends with the other side to this day. There was a little bit of hesitation at first, I know they did speak, but are they still friends? Evans:They are still friends. I recently went back to Belfast and had dinner with a lot of them all together. And the ones that couldn't meet for the integrated dinner asked about their team mates. The neighborhoods are too divided for them to visit each other so they communicate a lot online through bebo.com which is a social networking site over there. And they keep up with each other. They're not bashful about having pictures of each other, arm-in-arm on their social networking sites, and they communicate through me about each other because I'm in touch with all of them. Lapin: So that's amazing, Michael. How do you think you do this? How does sports diplomacy, which is really what this is, succeed where world leaders, prime ministers and presidents have failed? Evans: I mean just because a politician, two politicians come together and say they agree on something, it doesn't mean that the people on the ground are going to be agreeing on it. And most importantly the youth that are growing up in these environments, that doesn't mean that they agree with what's going on. So that's sort of just a face to the whole solution. I think what sport does, namely basketball, is that you put kids in a small, very small group together and they're forced to communicate in order to succeed; in order to win. And then the coaches role is very unique in that the kids all bond over having one voice and one person telling them what to do and guiding them along and helping them with success.",

Deepa: Mumbai is a very young city by Indian standards, only 500 years old, whereas a city like Delhi is really ancient. Mumbai used to be a fishing hamlet and it grew after the British arrived. So it's a young city and one that has been formed by migrants. Almost everyone in Mumbai has arrived here in the course of the last few generations, and so the city has a vibrancy and cosmopolitanism that is different from other cities. CNN: What makes Mumbai special to you? Deepa: The fact that I am so grounded here -- I was born here and four generations of my family live here. But also, Mumbai is on the move, it's vibrant, it's accepting of change and it's got a very active citizenry. It's the one place where you can make a mark, where you can make a difference. When you live in Mumbai you feel like you're in the nerve center of the country. You feel like all the big events are near you and you're connected to everything. In other cities I tend to feel more remote. If there's a new play it premieres in Mumbai, if there's a new band they play in Mumbai -- everything happens here. We're close to the center of commerce and I would rather be close to the center of commerce than the center of politics! What makes Mumbai special to you? Let us know . CNN: What are your favorite parts of the city? Deepa: I think my favorite is a place called Bhuleshwar. It's the \"native\" bazaar area that sprang up outside the old British fort. It's got a certain colorful energy and retains its 18th Century-feel to some extent. Everything under the sun can be bought there; it's got a spice market, a jewelry market. It's a busy, bustling area where a lot of trade happens, so I love it. CNN: Where do people go if they want to escape Mumbai's bustle? Deepa: We head out of the city -- we run for the hills! We go to the Western Ghats, which is a mountain range that runs parallel to the coast, barely a two-hour drive from where I live. \"There's climbing and a whole bunch of very interesting mountain forts to explore; there's whitewater rafting, paragliding, cycling. Ecologically, it's a very bio-diverse area so it attracts photography enthusiasts and bird watchers. We're very lucky that we're so close to it. We also have a lot of beaches just outside the city and they are popular as well. Within the city there are little enclaves of peace -- even in Bhuleshwar market there are temple complexes where there's a surprising silence compared to the bustle of the streets. We also have our seaside promenades where we love to hang out. The young, who have no other place to go, find romance on Marine Drive and Bandra Bandstand. It's Mumbai's version of Lovers Lane -- except the lane is wide open! CNN: What's a typical weekend in Mumbai? Deepa: We party quite hard, so Saturday and Sunday evenings are days when you go out with friends and family. There are a huge number of restaurants with all sorts of cuisines on offer. There are some great clubs -- my favorite right now is a place called The Blue Frog -- and there's an active cultural scene. Alongside all the partying we're all in a mad race to lose weight and look good. Bollywood is helping men wake up to the fact that there's nothing wrong with a well-toned physique. In all the suburbs of Mumbai there's a mushrooming of places where young guys are pumping iron and trying to be 'he-men.' CNN: Do you think the city's changed since the terrorist attacks last November? Deepa: Yes, I think there's a hardening of stances and an unwillingness to accept platitudes. I also think there is increased uneasiness between communities. CNN: Has tourism been affected by the attacks? Deepa: My own business went bust for two weeks. For two weeks I had nothing but cancellations in Mumbai and I was only saved by the fact that I was doing business in other cities. But then business picked up again. My first clients after the attacks were a Jewish American couple and I was heartened by the faith and support they showed for Mumbai. Mumbai also gets big tour groups that arrive by bus and I think that kind of group tour has lessened, but my business gets more independent travelers and they are still coming. People choose to respond to crises more positively than we think they will and I'm seeing very strong individual responses. CNN: If Mumbai was a person what would he or she be like? Deepa: This is a city which is strangely beautiful and strangely warty. At its heart this city is about money, it's a city of exchange and commerce, so it would be a trader or a wheeler dealer -- someone who's on the move, making deals and making money!",

    "input": "New York (CNN) -- A paralegal who accused the New York police commissioner's son of raping her inside a Manhattan law firm said the incident left her pregnant and prompted her to get an abortion, according to a source familiar with the investigation. The woman, described as around 30 years old, told police earlier this week of the alleged October attack by Greg Kelly, a former Fox News White House correspondent and current co-anchor on WNYW's \"Good Day New York.\" Kelly, 43, the son of New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly, has since taken a leave of absence from his anchor chair. He has not been charged with a crime. According to the source, the woman told authorities that over the course of three days in early October, the pair exchanged phone numbers, mutually flirted, talked and exchanged text messages about getting together. When they finally met for drinks at a South Street Seaport area bar, the woman told police that they each used credit cards and took turns paying, consuming drinks until she became intoxicated, according to the source. She said she then invited Kelly to her office building where they had sex in her boss' office, according to the source. The woman, whom authorities are not identifying, described her condition to authorities as \"woozy\" and said she was not a willing participant, the source said. She said she later learned that she was pregnant, telling authorities that it couldn't have been from her boyfriend, who had had a vasectomy, the source said. The woman told authorities she continued to exchange what the source described as nonconfrontational messages with Kelly following the alleged assault. Later, a man presumed to be the woman's boyfriend sought out the elder Kelly at a public event, according to Deputy Police Commissioner Paul Browne. The man said to the commissioner, \"'Your son's ruining my girlfriend's life,'\" Browne said. \"Kelly asked, 'What do you mean by that?,'\" added Browne, noting that the man said, \"there were too many people around, and so the commissioner told the man to write him a letter.\" It's not clear if the man had done so. Greg Kelly's attorney, Andrew Lankler, said the allegation of rape is false. \"Mr. Kelly strenuously denies any wrongdoing of any kind, and is cooperating fully with the district attorney's investigation,\" he said in a statement. \"We know the district attorney's investigation will prove Mr. Kelly's innocence.\" He said his client is \"cooperating fully.\" The scandal leaves Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. again confronted with a sex scandal that bears implications far beyond the courtroom. Vance was involved in the sexual assault case against former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn last year. A hotel maid accused Strauss-Kahn -- once considered a leading French presidential candidate -- of assault during an encounter in his room at New York's Sofitel. The charges were ultimately dropped. Vance's office has taken over the Kelly investigation to avoid possible conflicts of interest by would-be police investigators, said a source with knowledge of the probe. His office, which fended off criticism over its handling of the Strauss-Kahn case, has remained largely tight-lipped about how prosecutors are dealing with the Kelly investigation. Linda Fairstein, former head of the district attorney's sex crimes unit, said she's confident Vance's office is well-positioned to handle the Kelly case. \"He could have kicked it out of the county, but it's not a conflict for him,\" Fairstein said. \"It all comes down to what his investigators can do.\" Some of those investigators, she said, are former police officers who are capable of pursuing the case. Two days before the Kelly allegations surfaced this week, the newsman interviewed Vance about the handling of the Strauss-Kahn scandal. Prosecutors ultimately dropped that investigation due to apparent gaps in evidence and credibility questions about Nafissatou Diallo, the hotel maid. \"Your office chose not to prosecute Dominique Strauss-Kahn for sexual assault, an alleged sexual assault,\" Kelly said to Vance on \"Good Day New York.\" \"A lot of people were frustrated. They thought Nafissatou Diallo had a strong case that should have at least gone to trial. Why did your office decide not to prosecute DSK?\" Vance responded that he felt he could not prosecute \"beyond a reasonable doubt.\" \"Our job as a prosecutor's office is not to put points on the board,\" Vance said during the interview. \"Our job as a prosecutor's office is to try to do right. To pursue every case to where it should end up appropriately.\" The investigation is the latest high-profile case before Vance, who has often been seen as a reformer, following a series of sexual assault cases that has left his office open to criticism. In addition to the Strauss-Kahn case, Vance's office presided over an investigation of two New York police officers who were acquitted in May on charges of raping a 27-year-old woman whom they had helped home. A jury acquitted the men of felony rape and burglary but found them guilty of official misconduct, a misdemeanor. Vance is the son of Cyrus Vance Sr., who held various high-level Cabinet positions, including Secretary of State under President Jimmy Carter.",

She delivered this commentary during the \"Cutting through the Bull\" segment of Monday night's broadcast. CNN's Campbell Brown says nonemergency legislation needs time to be read by the public and Congress. (CNN) -- Whether by omission or commission, both the White House and Congress get a dose of blame for not living up to the new era of transparency promised by President Obama. The president's old campaign Web site still has this commitment there for all to see: . \"As president, Obama will not sign any nonemergency bill without giving the American public an opportunity to review and comment on the White House Web site for five days.\" Well, the president broke that promise barely a week after taking office when he signed the Lilly Ledbetter Bill dealing with equal pay for men and women. A good bill, and certainly one that could have survived a five-day comment period. So, maybe the White House folks just forgot? But then there is Congress and the Stimulus Bill. How fast could you get through it? According to the nonpartisan Sunlight Foundation, lawmakers had just 13 hours to read 1,100 pages of material that would cost the American taxpayer $787 billion. That's less than a minute and a half per page, with no time for bathroom breaks. No wonder so many of our lawmakers didn't seem to notice that last-minute exemption clearing the way for bailed-out companies like AIG to pay out big bonuses. So, the House tried to clean up the mess last week by rushing through another bill -- a tax on AIG bonuses. That bill was just 11 hours old before it went on the floor to be argued and then quickly approved. And the list goes on well before the president took office. The bank bailout got all of 29 hours, the rescue of Fannie and Freddie was only available for 19 hours. This is how bills could literally become, to borrow a phrase, too big to fail -- and too fast to stop. The Sunlight Foundation is calling on Congress to allow the American people three days, 72 hours, to read a nonemergency bill online before debate begins. We strongly agree. And yes lawmakers, you can have three days to read it over, too, before taking a stand. As for President Obama's promise of a five-day public review once a bill leaves Capitol Hill headed for his desk, it would be nice if he kept his word on this going forward. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Campbell Brown.",

    "input": "MacDill Air Force Base, Florida (CNN) -- The names of two people who tried Monday to enter MacDill Air Force Base with unauthorized weapons were released by officials Tuesday. The individuals were identified as Army Spc. Christopher Paul Kilburn based at Fort Riley, Kansas, and civilian Micah Noel Goodier of Palm Beach, Florida. Kilburn, who was on AWOL status from the Army, has been charged with desertion, a release from the air base said. He is being turned over to Army authorities, and additional charges are pending, the air base said. Potential charges against Goodier will be determined by the U.S. Attorney's Office, the air base said. Earlier, officials said a man and a woman tried to enter the base using fraudulent identifications, Vice Commander Col. David Cohen said at a news conference Tuesday. All gates at the base reopened Tuesday. They were temporarily closed after the heavily armed man and woman were taken into custody after trying to enter the facility without authorization. The pair were stopped early Monday evening at a gate at the base, which houses the headquarters for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Senior Airman Katherine Holt said. A search of the vehicle after they were detained revealed three handguns and three \"rifle-style\" weapons, Cohen said. The investigation was ongoing, he said. The incident was not being investigated as a terrorist threat, Cohen said. Authorities cordoned off the pair's sport-utility vehicle and searched it using a robot, but no explosives were found. Video showed base personnel removing weapons, ammunition and military-style clothing from the vehicle, which was later towed away.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Counting was under way Sunday in Myanmar's first election in 20 years, a poll that critics say is aimed at creating a facade of democracy. Polls closed Sunday and officials results were not immediately available, though critics say that the outcome was all but certain to be favorable to the ruling military junta. Riot police roamed streets in the city of Yangon, the former national capital that is also known as Rangoon. Election workers for the Union for Solidarity and Development (USD) had campaigned in the countryside, where many rural residents didn't know how to vote. The party is supported by the governing junta of mostly of ex-military members. \"These are our candidates for this region,\" a USD election worker told one resident. \"It is not important to put down the name of the party, but the people have to know our symbol and make their mark right here.\" Because many citizens in rural areas know so little about the political process, election workers said they also had to show people how to vote. \"I am not just campaigning for our party,\" the election worker said. \"I am educating the people on how to vote. Many people don't know how to vote.\" Their word is very influential -- especially in rural areas, where most people in the nation live. \"I don't know anything about the election,\" one woman said. \"If someone tells me what to vote, I will follow that guideline.\" Opposition parties like the National Democratic Force (NDF) are complaining that a lack of money is keeping them from running and campaigning in most areas of the country. An NDF representative said the party will only contest in about 15 percent of constituencies. Several residents said they did not expect any change as a result of the election. \"Nothing will change after the election,\" a farmer said. \"The government is not trying to convince us. We don't matter to them because we are poor.\" Not that it seems to matter to him. \"I don't care who will be elected,\" he said. \"I don't know whom I will vote for because I have no knowledge of politics.\" Government critics say the election is a sham, and Nobel Peace Prize-winning democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi has rejected voting in the elections, her lawyer said. The National League for Democracy, Suu Kyi's party, announced in March that it would not participate. A new law forced the NLD to choose between honoring Suu Kyi as its leader and risking the party being declared illegal, or ejecting Suu Kyi from the party and contesting the elections. \"Since NLD is not participating in this coming election, she doesn't want to vote,\" her lawyer Nyan Win said in October. Suu Kyi's party won a landslide election victory in 1990, but the military junta rejected the results. This year, the generals refused to allow international monitors to oversee the election and recently overhauled Myanmar's constitution in a way critics say is aimed at tightening the regime's grip. The constitution now requires more than 100 military nominees in parliament. Myanmar, also known as Burma, has been under military rule since 1962. In October, the military regime rejected international monitoring of Sunday's elections. \"Since we have many experiences in election, we don't need experts on this issue,\" said Thein Soe, chairman of the election commission. \"And since we have all ambassadors who are representing their countries, we don't think we need to invite any special group to observe the election since all the ambassadors are here and can watch it on election day,\" he added. U.S. President Barack Obama strongly criticized the elections in a statement Sunday. The elections, he said, \"were neither free nor fair, and failed to meet any of the internationally accepted standards associated with legitimate elections. The elections were based on a fundamentally flawed process and demonstrated the regime's continued preference for repression and restriction over inclusion and transparency.\" Opinion: Why the U.S. must not give up on Myanmar . One of the biggest flaws was the imprisonment of more than 2,100 political prisoners, who were denied the opportunity to participate, Obama said. The biased electoral commission left opposition candidates sidelined, he said, and the junta has denied registrations for some ethnic parties and canceled the vote in certain ethnic areas. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also criticized the country's rulers on Sunday. Speaking during a visit to Australia, Clinton said the country was holding \"flawed elections that once again expose the abuses of the military junta.\" And in a statement issued later Sunday, she said the generals \"missed an opportunity to begin genuine transition toward democratic governance and national reconciliation.\" \"Burma's leaders must come to realize -- after five decades of sustained internal conflict, economic mismanagement, and international pariah status -- that Burma needs a better way forward, a way that does not rely on suppression but rather strives to create a truly democratic and prosperous future for the Burmese people,\" Clinton said. The United States continues to insist on the \"immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners,\" including Suu Kyi, and will maintain its sanctions against leading members of the regime, she said. Suu Kyi has spent most of the past 20 years under house arrest, and the regime recently passed a law that made her ineligible to run because of a court conviction. The Nobel laureate has called the law unjust. A Myanmar court convicted Suu Kyi in August 2009 for breaching the terms of her house arrest after American John Yettaw swam uninvited to her lakeside house in Yangon and briefly stayed there. In February, a court rejected her appeal for release. Suu Kyi's current house arrest is due to end in mid-November, but her lawyers are skeptical that the military junta will release her. Her supporters have said her latest conviction was a way to remove her from the election campaign.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The pepper-spraying of student protesters at the University of California-Davis was an \"objectively unreasonable\" use of force by campus police, a state review of the incident concluded Wednesday. Scenes of UC-Davis police Lt. John Pike spraying seated demonstrators with the irritant at near point-blank range went viral on the Internet and triggered widespread criticism of school authorities. A 190-page report by a University of California task force concluded that the incident \"should and could have been prevented.\" The report spreads blame for the events that led to the confrontation across several members of the UC-Davis leadership but said Pike was primarily responsible for the \"objectively unreasonable decision\" to pepper-spray the demonstrators. \"On balance, the evidence does not provide an objective, factual basis for Lt. Pike's purported belief that he was trapped, that any of his officers were trapped, or that the safety of their arrestees was at issue,\" the report states. \"Further, there is little evidence that any protesters attempted to use violence against the police.\" But while criticizing Pike, the report also cites \"systemic and repeated failures\" among campus administrators it said \"put officers in the unfortunate situation in which they found themselves.\" UC-Davis Campus Police Chief Annette Spicuzza has been on administrative leave since November, along with Pike and another officer who has not been identified. Neither Pike nor Spicuzza agreed to be interviewed for the investigation, largely conducted by an outside risk-management firm, the report notes -- but Pike provided \"a lengthy statement\" to the firm. University administrators were worried that nonstudents from the Occupy movement in the city of Davis and other California cities would take part in the on-campus encampment that student demonstrators had set up. But they failed to determine whether that was true or whether \"other reasonable alternatives\" should have been used to ensure security before sending in police to break up the encampment, the report found. The scope of the police operation was \"ineffectively communicated,\" the report found. UC-Davis Chancellor Linda Katehi apparently believed that no force would be used, while the police operations plan called the use of force \"highly likely in this type of situation based on past events.\" The report found the campus police command structure \"very dysfunctional,\" with Spicuzza's lieutenants refusing to follow orders and getting into \"heated exchanges\" with the chief during the protests. Pike became an object of scorn after the protest. Pranksters across the Internet inserted the image of the helmeted officer into famous paintings, photos and movie scenes, while the hacker's collective Anonymous published his home and cell phone numbers online. Attempts to contact him for comment were unsuccessful Wednesday evening. The report accuses him not only of using unreasonable force, but of misusing his now-iconic weapon. The type of pepper-spray canister he carried was \"not an authorized weapon\" under campus police guidelines, and the officers \"were not trained in how to use it correctly,\" the report found. \"And Lt. Pike did not use it correctly,\" the report notes. The model he carried \"is a higher pressure type of pepper spray than what officers normally carry on their utility belts,\" and is designed to be used at distances of six feet or more.",

    "input": "NEW YORK (CNN) -- Miles Levin was determined to have his say in life, even with cancer ravaging his young body. Miles Levin wrote that cancer and the fear of death could expand your heart and mind. So when he died Sunday, six days before his 19th birthday, he had blogged a lifetime of thoughts and dreams, words that somehow pierced through cyberspace and moved tens of thousands of readers to respond. Miles blogged on the Web site of Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan. He isn't the only person to have written about a dying man's journey, but his wit and wisdom and choice of words, captured the imagination of his readers. His story was circulated well beyond the world of cancer patients and was told by mass media including the Detroit News and CNN. His wisdom was sought by parents of dying children, those recovering from the brink of death, even ordinary people captivated by his enjoyment of life in the face of death. In announcing his death Sunday afternoon, his family wrote: \"Miles went from a boy-man to a man-boy. At a cost that would knock your socks off, Miles still managed to pack a wallop. He could not and would not be held back ... from living life to the fullest.\" Remembering Miles' gifts Â» . He launched his blog in 2005 simply welcoming new readers and telling them he'd been stricken by a pediatric cancer called alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, a cancer that strangles the muscle tissues. He declared that his motto would be simply: \"It's always something.\" And it was. He got sick and then better and then sick again and still managed to navigate the milestones of adolescence: keeping up in school, a first serious girlfriend, college applications, prom. He became a little famous and laughed at himself. He wrote about the value of life and somehow acquired an almost supernatural ability to appreciate small pleasures such as a sunny day and the presence of a loving family. This notion that cancer and the fear of death could expand your heart and mind was adopted by readers as far away as Asia and South America. He declared that perhaps he'd been put on Earth to show people how to die of rhabdomyosarcoma with grace. When he was too sick to write, his mother, Nancy, chimed in: \"The boy Miles was in June of '05 was sweet, innocent, disorganized and ungrounded (\"earth to Miles\"). The man that Miles is today is clear, focused, heart centered, and purposeful. \"It was cancer that intervened. That deadly disease carried the power of transmutation, and Miles accepted the offer.\" She quit her full-time job as a psychotherapist to tend to him. The Sarcoma Foundation, which advocates for better treatment of soft-tissue cancers such as his, awarded him its 2008 Leadership in Courage Award a year early. Predicting he wouldn't be around to receive it, they taped his acceptance speech. A few months ago, knowing his high school graduation was probably his last milestone, he wrote: \"I can rest assured that even if I succumb to the rogue cells, I will leave behind a legacy of victory. \"Dying is not what scares me; it's dying having had no impact. I know a lot of eyes are watching me suffer; and -- win or lose -- this is my time for impact.\" He did have an impact. Fifteen-thousand bloggers were responding monthly this summer. In the end, they mostly sent him God's blessing. And they spoke of positive things like seeing the brightly shining stars on summer nights, the beauty of the will to survive, simple things that make you laugh, and the need to use words to soften the hardest of times. The funeral will be private. A public memorial service at Miles' high school, the Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, is planned for November. E-mail to a friend .

    "input": "(CNN) -- Gov. Mitt Romney got himself into a bit of a pickle Monday when he was quoted saying that he liked to \"fire people.\" Many have jumped onto this line as evidence of the candidate's callousness toward working people in a bad economy. Even his Republican primary competitors latched onto the comment, especially as it might relate to his work at Bain Capital Ventures, to show that Romney is in the business of making people unemployed. There's much more smoke here than fire, but some of it, unfortunately, is Romney's fault. He was the one, after all, who tried to pitch his time at Bain as evidence of his success as a \"job creator.\" Specifically, in the GOP candidates' debate on Saturday he said, \"In the business I had, we invested in over 100 different businesses and net-net, taking out the ones where we lost jobs and those that we added, those businesses have now added over 100,000 jobs.\" Turns out this isn't entirely correct. When pressed, his campaign released figures that showed that a number of companies helped by Bain under Romney's tenure, such as Staples, the Sports Authority, and Domino's, have added more than 100,000 jobs since then. But there are two problems with that figure. The first is that it's the number of jobs in all the time since Romney started at Bain, including many years after he left. The second is that there are no figures that show how many jobs were added or lost at other companies Bain managed, so a claim of a \"net\" addition is unproven. Bain could release comprehensive figures, but it's not likely it will. Nor should it. Bain isn't running for office, and I'm sure it considers the information proprietary. The larger issue, though, is that many people were fired through Bain's work. That is what often happens when venture firms take over businesses through leveraged buyouts. These stories make for compelling campaign commercials and news pieces. They don't paint Romney in as nice a light. That's compounded when he claims to \"enjoy\" firing people. But let's be fair. The governor is having his words taken out of context. Here's the full quote: . \"I want individuals to have their own insurance. That means the insurance company will have an incentive to keep people healthy. It also means if you don't like what they do, you can fire them. I like being able to fire people who provide services to me. If someone doesn't give me the good service I need, I'm going to go get somebody else to provide that service to me.\" Romney isn't talking about his time at Bain. He's talking about health insurance. Specifically, he's talking about how he'd like insurance to work. He would rather everyone be personally responsible for buying insurance, instead of getting it from the government. Then, he says, if the insurance company did a bad job, people could fire them. That sounds much better, right? Unfortunately, it's not. The first problem is that Romney ascribes motives to the insurance companies that make no sense. If you would just leave the insurance company if it did a bad job, then there is no incentive for it to keep you healthy. Healthy people are cheap for insurance companies, and sick people are not. If you go from being healthy to being sick, it's in an insurance company's best interest that you leave. That's an economic fact, not a moral judgment. It's only if you can't leave, if you have to remain on their books no matter what, that the company has an incentive to keep you healthy. The second problem is worse, though. Healthy people often don't know their insurance plans are bad until they get sick. Healthy people, after all, don't make as much use of their plans. Once they fall ill, though, it means now they have a pre-existing condition, which will make it almost impossible to them to get a new plan if they decide to fire their old insurance company. The way the private insurance market works today, almost no one has the luxury of firing the insurance company once he or she figures out it isn't doing a good job. That's not true in Massachusetts, of course. Thanks to Romney's legislation there, insurance companies can't deny you coverage and also can't charge you more for being sick. There, thanks to Romney, you can fire your insurance company and be assured of finding a better one. It will also be true for many more people once President Obama's Affordable Care Act gets fully under way in 2014. Since Romney seems so enamored of firing bad insurance companies, you might think he'd want to protect and promote other people's ability to do so.

Maybe you've been picking the wrong sports: tennis, soccer, football and baseball don't suit everyone's talents. If you suspect you may be sporty but haven't found your niche, you should consider some lesser known competitions. Rock, paper, scissors . It's the sport anyone with hands can play: no particular level of fitness or years of training required. Rock, paper, scissors is a game most kids played in the school yard -- and it now has its own league. In 2007, the Bud Light USA Rock Paper Scissors League National Championship was broadcast on television, with a top prize of $50,000. The main skill is mental, say players, comparing it to poker where the ability to \"read\" your opponent and anticipate his next move is highly prized. But Matti Leshem, co-commissioner of the USA Rock Paper Scissors League, has said it's also important to be fit: \"There are different styles of play. It gets quite energetic. A lot of power goes into it. The mental drain of it has a toll on the body.\" There are also injuries: \"People dislocate shoulders or sprain wrists.\" Extreme ironing . Web site extremeironing.com calls it \"the latest danger sport that combines the thrills of an extreme outdoor activity with the satisfaction of a well pressed shirt.\" Extreme Ironing takes the loathsome domestic task of ironing into \"extreme\" locations: cliff tops, rock faces, up trees, in crowed public places and underwater. Ironing boards, irons and creased clothes are the only equipment you'll need. Arm pads to prevent iron burns are optional. Organizers of a 2002 Extreme Ironing championship in Munich described it as \"a sport which combines the danger and the spirit of an extreme sport with boring housework you have to do. By Extreme Ironing the sportsman gets a great fitness and he is always looking smart.\" Ironing greats need to not only master the tough environments but also show creativity and flair in their ironing skills, get all the creases out and do it in record time. Extreme Ironing has been a surprise hit on YouTube where competitors show off their skills on the beach, up trees and up a mountain. Go on -- experiment with Extreme Ironing and make Mom proud. Musical Whistling . This is a sport that requires a special sort of dexterity: your lips and breath. Sorting out the champions from the amateurs, the International Whistlers Convention held in North Carolina has categories in classical and popular tune whistling, either accompanied or solo. But there are strict rules: \"Medleys combining more than one song will not be allowed. Time should be as brief as possible and not longer than six minutes for classical selections, or four minutes for popular selections, or five minutes for hand whistling,\" state the guidelines. Winners are judged on performance, originality, \"embellishments\" and the quality of whistling. The good thing about this sport is that you can practices whilst doing other tasks: whistle while you walk, while you work, while you Extreme Iron ... Buzkashi . Oh golly -- this is one weird sport we won't be trying. Buzkashi is a Central Asian sport involving horses, animal carcasses and whips. Buzkashi has been likened to polo, but instead of a ball, the headless carcass of an animal -- usually a headless goat or calf -- is used. The aim is to grab it off the ground while riding and then get it clear of the other players and pitch it across a goal line or into a vat. Play can last for several days. It's important during the game that the carcass doesn't disintegrate, so the calf is normally beheaded, disemboweled, has its limbs cut off at the knees and is soaked in cold water for 24 hours before play to toughen it. Occasionally, sand is packed into the carcass to give it extra weight. Special horses are trained for the event so they don't trample the riders, should they be thrown, and gallop at speed towards the goal line when the rider collects the carcass. E-mail to a friend .",

My duty to her memory is now to ensure her good reputation remains intact, and help law enforcement and prosecutors secure justice for the person or persons who took her away from me,\" Lance Cpl. Cory Killgore said in a statement. Marine Staff Sgt. Luis Ray Perez, 45, was arraigned on a suspicion of murder charge in San Diego County, California, in the death of Brittany Killgore, 22. He pleaded not guilty, according to CNN affiliate KGTV. Perez was with Brittany Killgore on April 13, the last time she was seen alive, according to authorities. Brittany Killgore had recently filed for divorce from her husband, who was serving with an artillery unit in Afghanistan's Helmand Province, investigators said. He was granted an emergency leave to return to the United States when he learned his wife was missing. \"Brittany's death cannot be in vain -- at this point, I don't know how to use this tragedy for good, but others have found their way and I hope to do the same,\" Cory Killgore said. Prosecutors said the victim was to go out to San Diego's Gaslamp quarter with Perez, who is based at Camp Pendleton, and a female friend, who decided not to go. \"Brittany sent a text message, in distress, asking for help, shortly after the point in time when Mr. Perez was with her,\" Deputy District Attorney Patrick Espinoza told KGTV. Perez was questioned after a friend filed a missing person report for Killgore, officials said. He was charged last week with two felonies unrelated to Killgore's death, receiving stolen property and possession of an assault weapon, and he has pleaded not guilty, authorities said. Authorities last week charged Jessica Lynn Lopez, 25, with first-degree murder in connection with Killgore's death. She has pleaded not guilty. If convicted, Lopez would face 25 years to life in prison. Investigators on April 17 found Killgore's body in a rural part of neighboring Riverside County. Authorities have not said how she died or what they believe links the suspects with her death. Lopez's relationship to Killgore has been unclear. KGTV in San Diego reported that authorities found Killgore's body based on leads stemming from Lopez's arrest.",

    "input": "Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- What was Hurricane Karl weakened Friday to a tropical storm after making landfall, but the heavy rain it spawned could still cause mudslides and flash floods in the Mexican interior, forecasters said. Karl was downgraded after coming ashore as a Category 3 hurricane about 10 miles (15 kilometers) north of Veracruz, Mexico, CNN's satellite and radar estimates showed. The storm is forecast to weaken to a tropical depression later Friday or Saturday and dissipate over the mountains of Mexico on Sunday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Friday evening. It added the Mexican government has discontinued all coastal watches and warnings. The storm delivered torrents of rain and fierce winds several hours before it hit land around 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET). Photographs sent to CNN's iReport by Ricardo Arcaraz, who lives in Veracruz, showed heavy rain and trees on top of power lines. He reported widespread outages. Maximum sustained winds later weakened to around 70 mph (115 kph) with higher gusts, according to the Hurricane Center. Karl, located about 75 miles (115 kilometers) east of Puebla Mexico, was moving west-southwest at about 9 mph (15 kph), it said. Satellite images and surface observations from Mexico suggest Karl is weakening rapidly as it passes through steep mountains, the Hurricane Center added. High winds remain a threat, though forecasters said they will likely weaken too in the coming days. The homes of at least 3,000 families in central Mexico were damaged, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. \"Tropical storm force winds are occurring in a small area near the center. These winds will continue to spread inland along the track of the center tonight but should decrease rapidly as Karl weakens,\" the Hurricane Center said. Potentially dangerous rain also was forecast. \"Karl is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 5 to 10 inches across portions of south-central Mexico, with isolated amounts of 15 inches possible in the mountains,\" the center said. \"These rains could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides.\" Within the past day or so, some 8 inches of rain has fallen in Veracruz, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. Some local flooding was already reported, the Mexican Interior Ministry said. Officials closed some roads and urged evacuations for large, low-lying areas in Veracruz. Mexico's National System for Civil Protection issued a red alert, the highest level, for central and southern Veracruz. An orange alert was in place for northern Veracruz and the states of Hidalgo, Tlaxcala and Puebla. A yellow alert was issued for the states of Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosi and Oaxaca. Mexican President Felipe Calderon also sent a warning Friday morning on his Twitter account. \"An alert for Hurricane Karl in the nation's central states,\" it said, adding that Karl \"could convert to a Category 4. It will enter through Veracruz around midday.\" Texas could be spared any major problems because a storm surge occurs only near the landfall location, said CNN meteorologist Sean Morris. Coastal flood advisories have been issued for south Texas, which means forecasters expect a small amount of coastal flooding but nothing serious, Morris said. A larger threat to south Texas will come from several inches of rain that could cause flooding and mudslides. The area could see as much as 4 inches by Sunday, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in far southern Texas. CNN meteorologists Brandon Miller and Mari Ramos contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Conakry, Guinea (CNN) -- Guinea once again has postponed the second round of voting in its presidential election, the new head of the West African country's National Independent Electoral Commission announced Friday. Gen. Siaka Toumani Toure, the Malian general who replaced controversial commission chief Louseny Camara on Tuesday, said it \"is not possible\" to hold the run-off vote between the two candidates, Cellou Dalein Diallo and Alpha Conde, on Sunday as planned. No new date was set for the next round of voting. The ballot was initially scheduled to be held two weeks after the first round voting, which occurred June 27.  Diallo won 44 percent and Conde 18 percent. The second round already had been postponed three times because of technical problems, mismanagement and internal disputes. Camara had been accused by Diallo's UFDG party of supporting Conde and stealing ballots from a populous Conakry suburb where Camara served as poll administrator. Camara has denied the accusations, but on Thursday he was sentenced to a year in prison and fined 2,000,000 Guinean francs (about $300) by Conakry courts for fraud in the first round. \"We have no comment yet about the new delay,\" said Moustapha Naite, a spokesman for Alpha Conde's RPG party. And Oury Bah, the vice president of UFDG, said, \"We agree with the new delay because there are many problems to fix.\" Experts are worried that the delay might spark renewed violence, which could threaten the democratic transition. Both sides have blamed the other for attacking its activists. Bah said that renewed violence between supporters of Conde and Diallo after a UFDG rally on Thursday in Conakry killed one UFDG supporter and injured some 30 more. \"Yesterday our supporters were attacked by elements of RPG. ... One is now in a coma and another died this morning,\" Bah said. Naite denied this claim and said RPG supporters were the victims of poisoned water sold at a rally for Conde in Conakry on Friday. \"Today all we can say is that at our meeting we have over 60 people laying in the hospital because of poisoned water that they sold at the Palais du Peuple,\" Naite said, referring to Friday's gathering place for RPG supporters. Two people were killed Tuesday in clashes between police and supporters of UFDG, who were demanding the replacement of Camara as the electoral commission head. Bah saw Tuesday's violence as evidence that parts of the government are biased against UFDG. \"The security forces are not neutral,\" he said. Prime Minister Jean-Marie Dore \"and his minister of security do not want elections.\" Guinea has been ruled by a military junta since a coup after the death of longtime autocrat Lansana Conte in December 2008.",

    "input": "(InStyle.com) -- When \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" premiered on September 19, 1970, it was almost revolutionary: the first television series focused on an independent (read: unmarried) career girl. And Mary's wardrobe was a little bit revolutionary too -- working women across the country were quick to copy her colorful dresses and wide-legged pantsuits. To celebrate the iconic program's fortieth anniversary, InStyle takes a look back at five fashionable TV shows -- and characters -- that have influenced women's at-work style. \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' Mary Richards lived in wintry Minneapolis and therefore had no shortage of cute cold-weather staples, including double-breasted coats, knee-high boots, and that famous blue tam. But it was her 70s work-wear that most women sought: colorful scarves, two-piece suits, and bright, office-appropriate dresses. See all 10 shows that influenced women's at-work wardrobes . \"Dynasty\" Okay, so the Carrington women weren't exactly your typical 9-to-5ers. Nevertheless, the big-shouldered, wasp-waisted creations worn by oil mogul Alexis (Joan Collins) and her longtime rival Krystle (Linda Evans) were popular enough with fans that the show spawned a signature fashion line, \"The Dynasty Collection\" which was designed by the show's costumer, Nolan Miller. \"Ally McBeal\" In 1998, shortly after the show's first season finale, Ally McBeal's disembodied head appeared on the cover of Time magazine along with the question, \"Is Feminism Dead?\" Despite the conclusions reached by that article (is it really fair to compare a fictional character to activists and thinkers like Susan B. Anthony and Gloria Steinem?), women do owe something to the flighty young lawyer played by Calista Flockhart: She almost singlehandedly made the workplace safe for bare legs, freeing us from the tyranny of mandatory pantyhose. InStyle.com: Fall's top trends for the office . \"Sex and the City\" The amount of money that Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), a freelance writer, spent on shoes was so improbable that it eventually became a plot point; her clothes only got more prohibitively expensive as the show went on. Still, \"Sex and the City\"had an enormous impact on regular women's style: Aside from all of those quickly knocked off (and forgotten) nameplate necklaces and oversized faux corsages, the ladies' willingness to play with fashion inspired legions.

    "input": "LONDON, England (CNN)  -- China's new found wealth has seen an explosion in the number of new developments springing up in what is, arguably, the world's biggest building boom. The construction of the Linked Hybrid project is underway in Beijing. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Beijing, which has transformed into a virtual construction zone as the city undergoes an Olympic makeover. Once a flat cityscape in the shadow of the formidable Forbidden City, Beijing has been struck by skyscraper fever. The city is now an architect's playground with foreign \"starchitects,\" like Norman Foster flocking to the country armed with individual creations that push aesthetic and technological boundaries. And the latest addition to the Beijing skyline is no exception. Standing on the edge of the former site of  the city's historic walls are a series of eight asymmetrical towers that bestride the smog-laden landscape like a colossus. Dubbed the Beijing Linked Hybrid, this architectural maverick has certainly pushed the design envelope to its very limit. The brainchild of New York architect Steven Holl, the mixed-use unit is a ring of eight 21-story towers, linked at the 20th floor by gently sloping public sky bridges, lined with galleries, cafes, restaurants, bars and shops. The development has been widely praised for its forward thinking sustainable design that includes a waste water recycling plant that sits beneath the complex and one of the world's largest geothermal systems, which eliminates the need for boilers or electrical air conditioners. It also has green roofs, filters to protect residents from pollution and large ponds to harvest recycled rainwater. The complex comes with its own Hyatt hotel and the 15-acre grounds feature everything from a basketball court to tai chi platforms, a cinematheque, bank, dry cleaners and even a kindergarten. For its 2,500 inhabitants, there are enough facilities and services to ensure they never have to leave the confines of the complex--except maybe to go to work-- when it opens in October 2008. Linked Hybrid is, in effect, a city within a city. Holl, who is also a professor at Columbia University, describes it as a \"visionary project on all levels\" and an \"ultra modern expression of ecological urban living.\" However, for all its plaudits, the Linked Hybrid project has attracted many criticisms. Among them is that its brand of green luxury won't come cheap. With apartments selling for 44,000 Yuan, or $6,000, per square meter, it can only appeal to China's nouveaux riches, further creating social division in what is already a deprived area of the city. Sound Off: Tell us what you think of the Linked Hybrid project. Critics also argue its city within a city element has isolationist overtones, reminiscent of gated communities that are becoming increasingly popular around the world. For Washington-based architect and urbanist, Howard Decker, buildings like Linked Hybrid form part of the problem and not the solution, although he applauds the efforts to \"green-up\" the project. \"This is a remarkably cold, hostile, hermetic place,\" he tells CNN. \"The disconnect with the surrounding urban fabric emphasizes the sense that the Linked Hybrid's principle references are to itself, not the larger city. \"The project is inward focused, the towers gathered around a central water feature at the middle of the towers. The towers seem to be in a conversation with one another, but not necessarily with the surrounding city.\" Decker, a former Chief Curator of Washington's National Building Museum, believes the concept of a street in the sky is \"antagonistic\" to how cities should work. \"First, last and always, great places, great cities, begin with great public domains, and in particular with their streets. We all own the street: it is the place where we all belong, where we can move and linger, where we can erect monuments to tell our stories, where we can sit and watch our neighbors, or sit and sip and read the news of the day.\" \"One of the joys of urban life is the collision of uses, the chance to sit and observe the passing scene, to see and be seen,\" he adds. This, he contends, cannot be done within Linked Hybrid where the inhabitant takes on more of an observational role. \"In the instance of the Linked Hybrids, this experience seems more like being in an observation tower, and less like being in the middle of a bustling, alive, exciting city,\" he says. Chief among the criticisms the Linked Hybrid project has attracted is that it is entirely out of context with its environment and \"desecrates\" the former imperial city. Linked Hybrid is sited just 2.5 miles from the Forbidden City and its residents can apparently see into the former palace on a \"clear day,\" Holl tells CNN. But Holl is adamant this is no 21st Century Forbidden City. \"Linked Hybrid is no more isolationist than Greenwich Village in New York,\" he says. \"We modeled it on the Rockefeller Center. Anyone can go in but of course the owner reserves the right to refuse entry. \"But people need to come in to allow the shops and commercial base to be successful.\" Furthermore, Holl rejects assertions that this is \"fortress architecture\" designed to keep all but the very rich out. He said: \"It's a very open and porous building,\" he says. \"It's free passage and the very opposite of a gated community. Our scheme is going against what's currently being built in China. \"What is being built now are point towers, isolated at the base. Gated communities with no services. I believe that we had to make a project that has a vision for urban interaction, one that has services, and is open to the public. There are actually 15 different ways to enter the complex.\" However, the concept of a city within a city, one that appears disconnected from its surrounding environment, rests uneasily with some, who see it as the stuff of dystopic science fiction. Some, like Beijing-based designer Mi Qiu, believe China ought to preserve more of its traditional housing forms like the centuries-old villages and hutong--neighborhoods traversed by narrow, winding alleys. \"These new buildings are totally different--they are just dumped down as if from nowhere. There is no harmony or overall concept or town planning,\" Qiu said in a BBC interview. But as China hurtles headlong into rampant modernization and urbanization, producing millions of new homeowners, its social fabric and thousands of years of its history will no doubt become fundamentally, and irrevocably, altered.",

This year's latest accolade makes Vienna number one in the world for the fourth year in a row. The annual survey by the global human resources consulting firm points not just to Austria's qualities but to much of the region's virtues. Eight of the report's top 10 cities are in Europe. Zurich is the world's second most livable city while three German cities -- Munich, Dusseldorf and Frankfurt -- follow close behind. \"Overall, European cities continue to have high quality of living as a result of a combination of increased stability, rising living standards and advanced city infrastructures,\" said Slagin Parakatil, Senior Researcher at Mercer.

Political considerations include government stability and crime rates. Economic factors take into account banking services and currency exchange laws. Health considerations include access to medical care and pollution levels. Transport, housing and recreation are also taken into account. City scores help multinational companies calculate compensation packages for the employees they dispatch overseas. A lower score often correlates into a better compensation package that includes hardship allowances, according to Mercer. Countries with unstable governments or undergoing civil strife tend usually have lower scores. Eight African cities dominate the bottom ten in this year's survey. \"The ongoing turmoil in many countries across North Africa and the Middle East has led to serous security issues for locals and expatriates,\" says Mercer's Parakatil. \"Companies need to be able to proactively implement mitigation plans, such as emergency repatriation, or adjust expatriate compensation packages accordingly.\" Around the word and on a regional basis, the cities that score the lowest are the following: . 64. Belfast, Northern Ireland (Western Europe) 71. Detroit, Michigan, (United States) 207. Dushanbe, Tajikistan (Asia-Pacific) 213. Tbilisi, Georgia (Eastern Europe) 219.

    "input": "BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN)  -- The ongoing presence of U.S. troops in Iraq \"shows that the (Iraqi) government and the occupation are not serious about the withdrawal,\" a key Shiite cleric in the country said Wednesday. A crowd gathers Tuesday after a deadly bombing in the northern Iraqi city of Kirkuk. Muqtada al-Sadr made the statement on his Web site a day after U.S. forces withdrew from Iraqi cities and towns in accordance with the security agreement between the United States and Iraq. About 131,000 American troops remain in the country, on bases and in outposts outside of population centers. \"The withdrawal should include all the occupation forces: army, intelligence, militias, and security companies and others. Otherwise, the withdrawal will be uncompleted and useless,\" al-Sadr said. \"We want a withdrawal and stopping the interference with Iraqi political, social and economic affairs,\" the statement said. Al-Sadr commands the loyalty of the Mehdi Army, one of the largest independent militias in the country. His agreement to a cease-fire with the government and its allies is considered a key factor in reducing the level of violence in the country. But he seemed to suggest Wednesday that Iraqis had the right to attack foreign forces in the country -- if not Iraqi security forces. \"If the occupation forces violate this claimed withdrawal, even with a government cover, then the people of Iraq will have all the right to express their opinion in a peaceful way, and the right to self-defense on condition of not harming the Iraqi people and the security forces,\" he said. Under an agreement signed in the waning days of the Bush administration, all U.S. forces will be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. Most will be gone by August 2010 under the withdrawal plan laid out by President Barack Obama, Bush's successor. The U.S. troops who remain are now tasked with supporting Iraqi troops and police, and must seek Iraqi permission to launch operations in the cities. the top U.S. general in the country said Tuesday that much of the country was safe. \"There is not widespread violence in Iraq,\" Gen. Ray Odierno told reporters in a video conference from Baghdad. \"There's still gonna be bumps in the road. There's still gonna be violence here,\" he added. Meanwhile, the death toll from a huge blast in northern Iraq rose to 35, local security officials said Wednesday. The car bombing took place in a busy commercial district in a predominantly Kurdish area of Kirkuk early Tuesday evening when the neighborhood was busy, security sources said. About 17 shops and houses were destroyed and 95 people were wounded, a police official in the Iraqi city added. Kirkuk is about 378 kilometers (235 miles) north of the capital, Baghdad. CNN's Yousif Bassil and Jomana Karadsheh in Baghdad contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- It's been a big tourism year for the Big Apple. New York expects to draw more than 50 million visitors by the end of 2011 -- a record for the city, Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced Tuesday. \"While playing host to the world isn't new for us, the number of visitors we're welcoming in recent years is new,\" Bloomberg said during a ceremony in Times Square, while surrounded by cheering tourism officials. \"That means more guests in our hotels, more shoppers in our stores, larger audiences in our museums and theaters, more diners at our restaurants.\" The city reached the milestone a year ahead of schedule, Bloomberg said. Throughout 2011, New York was the No. 1 city and overseas destination in the United States, his office added. To celebrate, the mayor named newlyweds Craig and Lucy Johnson from Lichfield, England, as the honorary 50 millionth visitors to New York and presented them with a \"golden ticket\" to the city. The couple will receive thousands of dollars' worth of gift cards from New York retailers and tickets to a Broadway show. The Johnsons were among the 10.1 million international visitors to come to the city this year. Another 40.1 million tourists came from within U.S. borders. Tourism is a huge moneymaker for the city, generating $32 billion in visitor spending and $48 billion in economic impact, Bloomberg's office said. \"New York City's quality of life has contributed to this great success, and we are confident we will sustain the success of our tourism industry in the months and years ahead,\" Bloomberg said.",

    "input": "London, England (CNN) -- The British government will compensate a number of British residents who were interned at Guantanamo Bay, Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke announced Tuesday, saying he could not reveal the amount of compensation. \"The settlement is not to be taken as any admission of liability,\" he said, portraying it as a way of resolving lawsuits against the British government so that an independent inquiry into torture allegations could get started. \"It was not in the interest of any party to get stuck in litigation,\" Clarke told the House of Commons. \"It could have taken years, it could have cost tens of millions of pounds,\" he said. \"It was a difficult and unusual situation, but it was the right thing to do. I think we've saved public money.\" The settlement will cover all British citizens and residents who were held at the U.S. military detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, as far as the British government is aware, Clarke said. At least six men had filed suit against the British government, seeking damages over human rights violations they say they suffered during their rendition to and detention at various locations, including Guantanamo Bay. The British government inquiry into the issue -- announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in July -- could not begin until the suits were settled, Clarke said. Police investigations will also have to be finished before the so-called Gibson inquiry can begin, he said. Amnesty International said that the British government isn't going far enough. \"Financial compensation can be an important part of the right to remedy and reparation for victims of grave human rights violations. However, it remains only one part,\" said Amnesty official Nicola Duckworth. The human rights group said lawyers acting for the British government have repeatedly sought to prevent disclosure of relevant material, and had argued for closed procedures allowing courts to consider secret material presented by U.K. authorities in closed sessions. And in the United States, the American Civil Liberties Union welcomed the British action while condeming Washington for not following suit. \"Here in the United States, the Obama administration continues to shield the architects of the torture program from civil liability,\" said Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU. \"If other democracies can compensate survivors and hold officials accountable for their endorsement of torture, surely we can do the same,\" he said.",

    "input": "(EW.com) -- There are few better ways for an actor to show off his chops than by playing the clever trickster in a thriller (think of Daniel Craig's 007 at the poker table, or Matt Damon's Bourne leading his CIA overseers through the looking glass). In the opening scenes of \"Safe House,\" you can tell what a good time Denzel Washington is having as Tobin Frost, an American spy in Cape Town, South Africa, who is five steps ahead of everyone else. His look is pure sleight of hand: In glasses, gray scarf, and overcoat, with an earring, a serious goatee, and his gray-flecked hair teased out, Washington resembles a hipster Malcolm X -- a great look for him, even if it feels like a costume. Meeting with an MI6 agent, Tobin purchases the mother of all top secret files, then wastes no time pulling out a lab kit that allows him to inject the file right under his skin. Very tricky! Moments later, he's under attack (a lot of folks want that file), so he turns himself in to the U.S. consulate. Only then do we learn that Frost is a rogue agent who ditched the CIA and has spent nine years trading secrets with America's enemies. Why has he done this? And why has he decided to turn himself in? Those questions form the bedrock of Washington's hyper-cool, minimalist performance. As a crew of Langley officials (Vera Farmiga, Brendan Gleeson, Sam Shepard) purse their lips with importance, Frost is placed in a CIA safe house overseen by Matt Weston (Ryan Reynolds), who's been twiddling his thumbs there for a year. When thugs enter, yet somehow fail to find Frost tethered to a chair, he and Matt escape, gunning through the streets in a smash-and-grab car chase. The movie, as if on an action time clock, punches in the standard set pieces: bloody fights, clattering shoot-outs, an escape through a packed soccer stadium. Some of this stuff is well-done, and some of it has been done a lot better. Yet \"Safe House,\" even when it's pummeling you effectively, has very little up its sleeve. Basically, the movie is a fizzless \"Bourne\" episode crossed with \"Training Day,\" featuring Washington as a good-egg-gone-rotten who, you know, has his reasons. Mostly, he schools Matt, his guard-turned-pursuer, in what it means to lie. Reynolds is physically impressive, even if his acting here consists of morphing from a deer-in-the-headlights look to a mean squint as the movie goes on. The director, Daniel Espinosa, shoots in highly saturated colors, edits everything into a frenzy, and creates the illusion of intrigue. But compared with a superior potboiler like \"Salt,\" which messed with your brain in entertainingly far-fetched ways, \"Safe House\" is action-movie porridge gussied up into a less-clever-than-it-seems mystery. Which is why the trickiness of Washington's performance begins to ebb, replaced by something somber that might even look tragic if this movie were actually about anything. B- .

    "input": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- One revolutionized women's hair in the 1960s. Another brought fear to Middle Earth. Another is a champion golfer who now designs courses all over the world. Christopher Lee is famous for playing Count Dracula and his roles in \"Lord of the Rings\" and \"Star Wars\" films. Vidal Sassoon, Christopher Lee and Nick Faldo are among those recognized this year on Queen Elizabeth's birthday honors list. Lee and Faldo will both receive knighthoods, meaning they can now be known as \"Sir Christopher\" and \"Sir Nick.\" Lee, 87, is famous for his portrayal of dark villains, starting with Count Dracula in a series of movies from the late 1950s until the 1970s. He gained a new generation of fans in in the past decade through is role as the bad wizard Saruman the White in the the \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy, and as the evil Count Dooku in two \"Star Wars\" prequels. World-famous golfer Nick Faldo holds six major championship titles -- three from the British Open and three from the Masters. He has the record for the longest streak of majors played -- 48 -- dating to the 1987 British Open, according to the PGA Tour. Faldo is now almost as famous for designing golf courses as he is for playing the sport. He also serves as a television commentator. A knighthood is the highest honor, and recipients may use the title \"Sir\" before their names. The equivalent for women is to be awarded the title of \"Dame.\" They recognize a \"pre-eminent contribution\" in any field. Next come CBEs, or Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, which recognize contribution to a slightly lesser degree. Recipients may not use the title of sir or dame but may use the initials after their names. Sassoon will be awarded a CBE for his services to the British hairdressing industry. It recognizes a lifetime of achievement for Sassoon, who as a young boy spent years in a London orphanage after his father left and his mother could not afford to care for him. Later, after his mother dreamed of her son being in a barber shop, she apprenticed him to a local barber. That began a career that saw him develop two classic hairstyles of the Sixties -- the Bob and the even shorter Five-Point Cut -- along with an eponymous hair care line, range of hair care tools, and chain of salons. Also receiving a CBE is Jonathan Pryce, a Golden Globe-nominated actor who has had roles in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies, \"Ronin,\" and the James Bond film \"Tomorrow Never Dies.\" He won a best actor award in 1995 at Cannes for his part in the movie \"Carrington.\" Actor Alan Cumming will receive an OBE, or Order of the British Empire, awarded for notable achievement in any field. He was recognized for \"services to film, theater and the arts and to activism for equal rights for the gay and lesbian community.\" A large number of artists and others in creative fields are featured on this year's list. Andrew Motion, who was Britain's poet laureate until he stepped down this year, will receive a knighthood, and several names in fashion will also receive awards. Fashion designer Jeff Banks will receive a CBE; Frances Marie Corner, the head of the London College of Fashion, will receive an OBE; and MBEs will go to Christopher Bailey, the creative director at Burberry, and Natalie Massenet, the founder of online designer shopping site Net-a-Porter. Honors lists are published twice a year -- once on New Year's Day and once in June, to mark the queen's \"official\" birthday. The queen's actual birthday is in April but she celebrates it in June because the weather is better.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Cautious American travelers have long avoided travel to North Africa and the Middle East, and the recent attacks on U.S. consulates aren't likely to make the risk-averse reconsider. Yet seasoned travelers say a lack of familiarity with those regions creates generalization and confusion among travelers that could work against tourism to the United States, if the tables were turned. \"I was in Tunisia when ... people were killed at the theater in Colorado, and I was in Tunisia when there was a shootout at the Empire State Building. What people think over there when they hear this, you would think no one would ever come to the United States,\" said Jerry Sorkin, owner of TunisUSA, a tour operator that organizes trips to destinations including Tunisia and Algeria and had recently been weighing resuming tours of Libya, which the company suspended last year. Veterans of travel to tense or unstable areas aren't easily deterred, despite shocking acts of violence like the attack that killed U.S. ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. Still, acts of terrorism obviously give many travelers (and their parents) pause. One New York City-based father was trying Wednesday to touch base with his son, who is spending a junior semester abroad in Jordan. \"Jordan is of course much safer and more stable,\" said the father, who declined to be identified out of concern for his son's safety. \"But of course I am concerned and have tried to Skype him (left a message) and will talk to him later. The fact is that life goes on for the vast majority of people in these countries despite the 'big' events.\" Pathik \"Tik\" Root won't let the recent attacks alter his plans to travel to Yemen in two weeks for a new job at a start-up news agency. Root was just starting a semester abroad in Damascus, Syria, last year when he stumbled onto what he thinks may have been an anti-government protest in the Old City. He was arrested and held for two weeks in a Syrian prison before being released. U.S. increases embassy security worldwide after Libya attack . \"Attacks like these are meant to change behavior, and if I were to drastically change my plans or my routine it could, in their eyes, justify their use of violence,\" he wrote in an e-mail. \"The attacks were intended to be a provocation, but we shouldn't take the bait.\" \"Yes I will likely be a bit more cautious about what I do and how I do it in Yemen as a result -- especially on potential flash-point days like 9/11 -- but I'm still going there,\" Root said. Despite the violence and cautions from the State Department and U.S. embassies to Americans living or traveling abroad, Root and other expatriates say they will carry on with their plans in politically volatile parts of the world, taking the precautions they would advise for any American. Ask lots of questions . If you're visiting someplace for the first time, talk to experienced travel agents and well-traveled friends and ask lots of questions. The violence in a particular country may not be occurring in a nearby country. The violence in Libya \"certainly will inhibit people from wanting to go to that part of the world and many of them are already inhibited rightly or wrongly, misunderstanding or not misunderstanding, they're already feeling that they should stay away from the region,\" said Sorkin, owner of TunisUSA. The company had been planning to launch a marketing campaign as part of its efforts to resume tours in Libya, but he said that any campaign \"would surely fall on deaf ears\" over the next couple of months. The U.S. State Department issued a travel warning Wednesday against all travel to Libya by U.S. citizens. \"We're constantly feeling the pulse (across the region), not only on a personal level, but constantly with our people on the ground,\" he said. \"Whether it's drivers, guides, lecturers -- we never want to put anyone in harm's way. But generally these regions are very safe.\" Daily life not reflected in the news . Raven Smith lives in Mali with her husband and 15-month-old son and pays attention to the political unrest there. \"I can see that the information that is publicized is not reflective of the day-to-day life here,\" she wrote in an e-mail from the capital city of Bamako, where she works on a project strengthening agricultural systems in villages. The situation in Mali doesn't capture the whole picture, Smith said. \"Weddings are still going on, holidays are being celebrated, fields are being tended.\" She's not naÃÂ¯ve, however. \"My plan with my family is that if Bamako seems that it is flaring up, that they will go and spend a few weeks visiting (my husband's) family in Guinea until we see where everything settles,\" she wrote. \"I truly hope it doesn't come to that, but it is never a bad idea to have a backup plan.\" Pay attention to cultural mores . Whether you're visiting for a short time or booking an extended stay, pay attention to cultural norms. \"I do try and respect the general cultural norms,\" wrote Smith. \"No showing knees is a big one. Not drinking heavily in public, not inviting men into my house. I'm married now, but even before.\" \"I will always stand out, and I have to realize that,\" she wrote. \"But I am also responsible for being a face of America. I am the one who can break stereotypes ... about Americans, and I take that pretty seriously, especially relating to the stereotypes about American women.\" What do the locals say? Just as New Yorkers or Los Angelenos might warn you to stay away from particular parts of their beloved cities, residents in other countries might tell you areas to avoid at night or during some events. Pay attention. \"Common sense that is necessary in any foreign country is still enough to get by here,\" wrote Bradley Williams, an undergraduate at the American University in Beirut, via e-mail. \"Beirut is more or less safe despite the occasional burning tires (but) I would exercise caution when going to the Bekaa Valley or the South,\" he wrote. \"Due to the kidnapping, it's not a good idea to go by oneself, for fear of appearing a lone foreign spy, (and it's) not a good idea to travel there at night. However, I think this applies to all people in those areas, not just foreigners.\" Get to know people . American-born Chadwick Van Vasa lives in Tunisia in North Africa and is fluent in Arabic, the result of his mother moving to Morocco when he was a child and marrying a Moroccan. Yet he still stands out as a blond-haired, blue-eyed American in the capital city of Tunis, where he lives with his wife and three children and works as a business consultant. His solution? The same notion that keeps people safe in their neighborhoods in Charlotte, Omaha and Seattle: \"I take interest in my neighbors,\" said Van Vasa, speaking on his cell phone from Tunis. \"Our social life and work is very much integrated here. We make meals together. Our kids play together. Because of that, I don't feel threatened. In my day-to-day life, I don't see hostility in my personal interactions with friends.\" Look at a map . If you are determined to avoid any part of the world where violence has recently flared, there are still African, Middle Eastern and other countries to visit. Moroccan tourism often suffers when violence escalates in the region. Travel writer Zora O'Neill says she feels perfectly safe right now studying Arabic at a language school in Morocco for an upcoming book. \"Fortunately it's Morocco, which is generally known for being stable, secure and thousands of miles from Libya.\" How do you feel about global travel amid anti-American protests? What do you do to stay safe? CNN's Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The oil spill on the Gulf Coast has states and visitors bureaus working hard to keep the public updated and reassure beach-bound travelers. Here are some of the latest updates from destinations affected by the oil disaster: . Northwest Florida . The Escambia County Health Department has rescinded a health advisory that had been issued for beaches stretching from the Florida-Alabama border to the entrance of the Perdido Unit of the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Government officials said that there was no oil sheen or oil slick observed in the water from the high water mark out to 100 yards from shore. Over the weekend, isolated tar balls appeared along several beaches of south Walton County, but all 15 beach communities remain open, according to the Walton County Tourist Development Council's website. A no-swim advisory has been lifted for Fort Walton Beach, Destin and Okaloosa Island, according to the Emerald Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau, which represents the three destinations. \"While crews continue to work to remove any remaining tar balls that may have floated ashore, visitors and locals alike are invited to enjoy the beaches as they normally would,\" the visitors bureau website said. iReport: See photos from Okaloosa Island . Dime-size to 5-inch tar balls continue to wash up in widely scattered areas of northwest Florida, but all of the state's beaches remain open, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism corporation. \"There have been no reports of Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill-related oil products reaching the shore beyond the Northwest Florida region,\" Visit Florida's website said. iReport: Share your photos of affected beaches . Scattered tar balls and oil patches have affected Panama City Beach. \"The beaches are open and the swimming is still safe,\" the area's visitors bureau website said. The water at Pensacola Beach is also open for swimming, according to the Pensacola Bay Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. \"Very light and sporadic tar balls have been reported on Pensacola Beach,\" the bureau's website said. Gulf Islands National Seashore . All of the Gulf Islands National Seashore sites, which are in Florida and Mississippi, are open, the National Park Service's website said. Fort Pickens, Florida, has experienced tar balls on shore, and skimming boats have been collecting oil offshore at Petit Bois Island, Mississippi, and Perdido Pass. \"Surveillance for oiling continues throughout all park areas on a daily basis. Cleanup operations continue throughout the park,\" the website said. Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama . Gulf Shores and Orange Beach, Alabama, have experienced significant oiling, according to the Alabama Gulf Coast Convention and Visitors Bureau. \"The beaches are open and visitors are still welcome to sunbathe and walk the beach, but we strongly suggest they swim in a pool or enjoy our many off-beach activities,\" the site said. The Alabama Department of Public Health has issued an advisory against swimming in waters off Gulf Shores, Orange Beach and Fort Morgan or in bay waters close to Fort Morgan, Bayou St. John, Terry Cove, Cotton Bayou and Old River. Grand Isle, Louisiana . Oil is affecting more than 45 miles of Louisiana coast, according to a state emergency website, although most of the coast is unaffected. \"The primary affected area is from the mouth of the Mississippi River extending east. Over 75 percent of Louisiana's coastal waters extend westward from the mouth of the Mississippi River,\" according to the Cajun Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau website. Grand Isle has closed its public beach, the site said.",

    "input": "(Mashable) -- Siri may have her critics, but Apple's talkative virtual assistant is definitely useful for some functions, like checking the weather and texting. Nuance, which works with Apple on voice control, now plans to take Siri-like abilities to more apps. The product is called Nina, and it'll let businesses build voice capabilities right into their apps -- iOS or Android -- via a software development kit (SDK). Nuance says it's the first voice assistant with an SDK (Siri still doesn't have one), and Nina obviously has access to all of Nuance's data on the industries that use its tech: banks, airlines, hotels, retailers and more. Nina is aimed at the enterprise, essentially taking the automated call center functions you might encounter when calling an 800 number, and putting it into an app. Mashable.com: Here's the most stunning photo of Mars the world has ever seen . \"Nina takes natural-language understanding, and it provides a way for a developer to add that into an app,\" says Robert Weideman, executive vice president of Nuance's enterprise division. In a demo at Mashable's offices, Nuance reps showed us a mock banking app equipped with Nina. Responding to commands like \"Pay my bill,\" or even \"Pay the full balance on my Visa bill on August first,\" Nina performed tasks that would probably take complex navigation in one step. Mashable.com: What does Siri know about the iPhone 5? Nina is dependent on Nuance's Voice Assistant Cloud, so she won't work without a network connection. And as we discovered in the demo, her speed and ability to parse longer phrases depend on the quality of that connection. Using a Verizon 3G modem, Nina had trouble figuring out the longer bill-paying command above, but on Wi-Fi she executed it almost instantly. Nina also happens to sound almost exactly like Siri, though Nuance says businesses will be able to choose from 40 different voices, and even be able to customize it with their own voice \"persona,\" if they have one. One of the major differences between Nina and Siri is voice biometrics, which means Nina can actually tell that it's you talking, and not someone who just picked up your phone. This can act as both a security and convenience feature -- after all, passwords become redundant if the app can tell it's the right person speaking just by voice. Mashable.com: Google ditches apps for Teams and 3 other products . \"For the first time on a mobile device, our virtual assistant doesn't just understand what you said and what you want, we can actually understand who said it,\" says Weideman. Nuance is releasing the SDK for Nina today, and the company says the first crop of apps incorporating the service should arrive in the fall. What apps would you like to see Nina built into?

    "input": "(CNN)  -- Houston Rockets team physician Tom Clanton has said the foot injury currently sidelining Chinese center Yao Ming could threaten the seven-foot-six-inch player's career. Yao Ming's entire basketball future could be in danger due to his persistent foot injury. \"At this point, the injury has the potential for him missing this next season and could be career-threatening,\" Clanton told the Houston Chronicle regional newspaper. \"One of the things we are trying to get is a consensus opinion on that, to make certain there is no option we are overlooking that would provide an earlier return or would be an option for treatment that he would prefer rather than doing additional surgery,\" he added. Yao fractured his left foot last month during a semifinal match against the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Western Conference semifinals and has been visiting specialists ahead of treatment since then. Clanton continued: \"At this stage, he is having no symptoms or physical signs, he has no tenderness, no swelling, no redness. When he came back in, he was feeling like everything was perfect, and he would start rehabilitation and get ready to play. \"The findings on the CT were shocking for him and for us. You don't treat a CT scan; you treat a patient. We are looking for every reason to treat this on clinical findings but don't want to put him at risk for a greater fracture,\" he added. The diagnosis raises doubt over the playing future of one of the biggest stars in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and one of the most famous celebrities to hail from China. Yao is a national hero in his homeland, and the news has prompted a frenzy of postings on the internet, arguing about the why's and wherefore's of his injury. \"He is really tired,\" says one Netizen posting on Sina.com. \"He needs to rest, we cannot let the giant fall!\" \"I wish everything will work out well for Yao Ming,\" says another teenage basketball fan. \"There is always a way to deal with injuries. We should not give up.\" Some Yao supporters think he should take a long break -- even for the whole season -- and make a comeback later. \"I think his injury is very bad,\" opines Ma Jian, a TV commentator who played for the Chinese national team. \"With all the weight training the team have put him through in the past seven years, Yao has gained about 20 kilos in his upper body. But his lower body, especially his feet, did not gain much strength to hold his large frame.\" The 28-year-old Yao has been a perennial pick for the NBA All-Star teams since moving from the Shanghai Sharks to the Rockets in 2002. Yao also captained the Chinese team as hosts at the 2008 Beijing Games, as well as taking the role of flag-bearer in the opening ceremony. Yao was awarded the honor of \"model worker\" in 2005 by China's ruling Communist Party. However, despite his popularity, Yao still has his share of detractors. Known as \"Yao hei\" -- they are people who are out to smear the player. \"He is a man made of glass,\" says one posting on Sina.com. \"Should we call him Yao the glass or Yao the porcelain?\" asks one rhetorically. Yao is now a multi-millionaire, earning millions of dollars yearly, not just from his NBA team but from lucrative commercial endorsements. Admirers say Yao has done more for improving China's image overseas than any modern-day politician or diplomat. Next to the giant panda, Yao is perhaps China's best known and much loved, icon, in part because exudes a wholesome, feel-good image. \"He is such an affable, likeable guy,\" recalls Colin Pine, who used to serve as his personal translator during his years as an NBA rookie in Houston. His demeanor on and off the court has endeared him to the media and multitude of basketball fans overseas, who admire his modesty and maturity. His loyal fans hope Yao will get an extension of his already long and successful career.",

Australian Open champion Federer is set to be sidelined for up to six weeks and may not return to action until a big hard court event in the United States in March. Federer, who won his 16th grand slam when beating Britain's Andy Murray in Melbourne, has been advised by a doctor not to play for at least a fortnight. He is set to play at the Masters Series event at Indian Wells which starts on March 11, but may have to wait until the following tournament in Miami. \"There are no guarantees that I will play at Indian Wells -- this could be a maximum of six weeks, but if it's treated properly everything should be fine and I should be back fairly quickly,\" he told the official ATP Tour Web site. Federer, who is a four-time Dubai Open champion, had traveled to the United Arab Emirates to practice ahead of the tournament, but found he was struggling. \"On Wednesday I couldn't get up anymore - and the next day I just wasn't in shape at all,\" he said. \"It's a lung infection -- it's the first time I've had it - breathing is difficult -- I feel I am not fine, I'm still very tired and slow. \"The doctors say it's too serious for me to try -- and that I should rest for at least two weeks -- obviously I can't take any more chances.\" Federer, who has a home in Dubai, was looking to regain his title from Novak Djokovic, who will now be top seed, with Murray also in the field for his first tournament since Australia. Czech Jan Hernych, who went out in the final round of qualifying, benefits from Federer's withdrawal to go into the main draw. In men's ATP action on Sunday, Sam Querrey beat fellow American John Isner in the final of the tournament in Memphis.

The series of videos showed scenes from inside the San Francisco International Airport and were narrated by the pilot, who pointed out the contrast between the passengers who were heavily scrutinized, while a single door separated employees who worked on the airfield from the airport. \"I was trying to bring up the obvious, ludicrous TSA-type of security,\" the pilot said, referring to the cell phone videos he posted, and later removed, from the popular video-sharing website YouTube. The pilot requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. He said he didn't think much about posting his videos online in late November, but that within a matter of days, his chief pilot called him to ask him to remove the videos because they were \"stirring a commotion.\" A few days after that, the pilot was informed by the TSA that he was being suspended from a program in which he participated, the Federal Flight Deck Officer program. As an officer in the program, he was deputized by TSA to carry a handgun in the cockpit. \"Basically, an air marshal in the sky,\" the pilot said of the volunteer program. After his suspension, four air marshals and two local deputies showed up at his home near Sacramento, California, to personally confiscate his weapon. The only answer he could get from the TSA as to why he was suspended from the program was that he may have violated a regulation, he said. The TSA said that it holds those serving as federal flight deck officers to \"the highest ethical standards,\" and said it took action because the pilot was in the program. \"FFDOs must be able to maintain sensitive security information as a condition of the FFDO program,\" TSA spokeswoman Sarah Horowitz said. \"As the issuing authority of credentials and firearms, TSA reviews each possible violation of those standards and acts accordingly up to and including removing an individual from the assigned role.\" Horowitz also defended security measures at the San Francisco airport, saying that there are \"measures in place that are both seen and unseen.\" In the aftermath of the incident, the pilot said he resigned from the program. In the age of WikiLeaks, where divulging sensitive information can be so controversial, why did this pilot decide to share his videos so publicly? \"I didn't think anything would come of it,\" said the 50-year-old pilot, a veteran who was a maintenance test pilot. \"This is really about getting the message out and demanding intelligent security,\" Don Werno, the pilot's attorney, said. \"No state secrets are being shown here. What's being shown here is a lack of security.\" Beyond the TSA action, the pilot's airline had not taken any action against him, and he counts on the support of his union. However, when the sheriff's deputies showed up at his house with the air marshals, they also took his California concealed weapons permit. The pilot said this permit was unrelated to his work for the TSA. CNN's Jim Barnett contributed to this report.",

Gabor, 93, was taken by ambulance from her Bel Air, California, home to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where she had undergone hip replacement surgery earlier this summer, publicist John Blanchette said Tuesday. The spokesman for Gabor's daughter Francesca Hilton said the doctor told Hilton the situation was \"not life-threatening.\" Gabor was hospitalized for several days earlier this month for complications relating to the surgery. Her husband, Prince Frederic Von Anhalt, was \"very agitated\" after calling for an ambulance Tuesday morning, Blanchette said. Gabor had returned home from the hospital two weeks ago because she \"wants to spend her final days at her home,\" Blanchette said at the time. She spent three weeks in the hospital after breaking her hip in a fall from her bed on July 17. She has been frail and \"pretty much confined to a wheelchair\" since a 2002 car accident, said Von Anhalt. The crash happened when the car in which she was riding with her hairdresser slammed into a light pole on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. The glamorous Hungarian-born actress, the second of the three celebrated Gabor sisters, is most famous for her many marriages. Among her husbands was Oscar-winning actor George Sanders. Her more prominent films include John Huston's 1952 Toulouse-Lautrec biopic, \"Moulin Rouge;\" \"The Story of Three Loves\" in 1953; \"The Girl in the Kremlin\" in 1957; and Orson Welles' 1958 classic, \"Touch of Evil.\" CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN)  -- Sudan on Tuesday signed a framework peace accord with rebels from the nation's volatile Darfur region, state media reported. The framework agreement is considered the first step towards the achievement of a lasting peace accord in Darfur. The signing of the cease-fire agreement with the rebel Justice and Equality Movement coincided with a four-way summit in Doha, Qatar, the state-run SUNA news agency said. Participants at the summit include the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani; Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir; the president of Chad, Idris Deby; and Eritrean President Assais Afwerki, SUNA reported. The participants are expected to discuss means of achieving peace in the region, welcoming the steps for realizing peace in Darfur, progress of the relations between Qatar, Sudan, Chad and Eritrea and other issues of mutual concern, SUNA said. Tahir al-Fati, chairman of the Justice and Equality Movement's legislative assembly, told CNN on Saturday that a preliminary document for the framework agreement was signed Saturday in Chad between representatives of the two sides. A permanent cease-fire -- which, according to this preliminary accord, is to be signed before March 15 -- will be a final step, al-Fati said. Last year, Sudan's government and the JEM rebels signed a confidence-building agreement in Qatar, a step toward ending the six-year conflict that has killed hundreds of thousands. Qatar has been mediating talks between the two sides in the Darfur conflict, which erupted in 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Khartoum government. The government launched a brutal counterinsurgency campaign, aided by government-backed Arab militias that went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. Al-Bashir is under pressure to end the fighting, particularly after the International Criminal Court charged him with genocide last year in connection with the government's campaign of violence in Darfur. In the past seven years, more than 300,000 people have been killed through direct combat, disease or malnutrition, the United Nations says. An additional 2.7 million people fled their homes because of fighting among rebels, government forces and allied militias. CNN's Jennifer Z. Deaton contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(InStyle) -- It's been almost three decades since the first-ever MTV Video Music Awards. And from the very beginning, stars like Madonna aimed to please their fans by shocking them, with a combination of risquÃ© routines -- remember that \"Like A Virgin\" floor dance? -- and outrÃ© fashion. So, in anticipation of the award show's 27th iteration, which airs on Sunday, September 12 at 9 p.m. EST, InStyle looks back at five of the most memorable VMA performances and appearances ever, and wonders: Can we still be shocked, or have we seen it all? We'll be watching. 1984 At the inaugural ceremony in 1984, Madonna attained instant superstar status thanks to a scandalous rendition of her already-controversial single, \"Like A Virgin.\" Clad in a lingerie-inspired \"wedding dress,\" complete with veil, \"boy toy\" belt, gloves, and a see-through polka dot skirt, she danced atop a giant cake, writhed on the floor and generally set the bar sky high for all subsequent would-be pop stars. See all of the VMA style shockers . 1999 Lil' Kim didn't perform at the 1999 show, which may have been for the best, given the extreme precariousness of her glittering purple ensemble. Instead, she presented the award for Best Hip-Hop Video with the help of a slightly nonplussed-looking Mary J. Blige and Diana Ross, who couldn't resist reaching over and jiggling the pasty-covered part at the podium. 2000 It was Britney Spears's second time at the VMAs -- she'd debuted the previous year, singing a relatively tame version of her first single, \"... Baby One More Time.\" But in 2000, she stepped up and changed the game, opening with a cover of the Rolling Stones' \"Satisfaction\" (which she performed while dressed in a menswear-style pinstriped suit), before segueing into her hit \"Oops! ... I Did It Again,\" and tearing off her shirt, jacket and pants to reveal a surprising nude-tone two-piece bodysuit. InStyle.com: Britney Spears's style transformation . 2003 In 2003, for the 20th Video Music Awards, VMA MVPs Britney and Madonna teamed up (along with Christina Aguilera) for a startling performance that nabbed each of them a second spot on our top-five list. The show opened with each of the younger stars paying tribute to Madonna's first-ever VMA appearance nineteen years earlier, singing \"Like A Virgin\" in not-so-virginal white. Then the Material Girl herself turned up in a suit to sing \"Hollywood\" ... and to kiss Britney, then Christina, on the lips. (Missy Elliot popped out of a \"wedding chapel\" to rap the finale.) InStyle.com: Madonna's transformation . 2009 Lady Gaga began her performance at last year's VMAs precisely where Madonna ended hers 25 years before: Dressed in white and rolling on the ground. But it's difficult to imagine anyone -- even Madge -- engineering the spectacle that followed as Gaga ran through \"Poker Face,\" and \"Papparazzi,\" then wrapped things up by rubbing fake blood all over her torso, face and hair. (She even got some in her eye, for maximum ick.) The other ensembles she donned that night were only slightly less startling: Her sheer red Alexander McQueen dress, topped with a lace mask and matching crown, was a standout.

    "input": "(CNN) -- After four nights of rioting, the Anaheim was calm Wednesday night as federal authorities agreed to examine police shootings in the city, including one Saturday that sparked the protests. \"We are aware of the concerns in the city of Anaheim and will review the recent incidents to determine whether a federal civil rights inquiry is warranted,\" said spokeswoman Laura Eimiller with the FBI's Los Angeles field office. No inquiry has been opened yet, she said. Police shot and killed two men in Anaheim over the weekend, but it was Saturday afternoon's shooting of Manuel Diaz, 25, whom police described as a gang member, that sparked an immediate angry reaction from bystanders. Days of raucous protest and confrontations with police followed. Police and an attorney for the Diaz family have both said that he was unarmed at the time of the shooting, though police say he was throwing objects at the officers. The second shooting occurred Sunday, after a man officers were pursuing in a car theft case allegedly opened fire on police. They returned fire, killing him. Anaheim Mayor Tom Tait said Wednesday that he asked the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles to investigate both shootings, but said violent protests \"will simply not be tolerated in our city.\" \"When the investigations are concluded, we will have a clear and complete understanding of these incidents,\" Tait said. \"At that time, we will have additional public dialogue about any actions that need to be taken. ... We will not, however, accept any violent protests, vandalism or arson perpetrated under the guise of public protest.\" On Tuesday, demonstrators disrupted a city council's meeting at the Anaheim City Hall, less than a mile and a half north of Disneyland, the city's most famous tourist attraction. Eyewitness video: Rioters clash with police . Protesters blocked access to the building, forcing a delay in the session as police moved to clear emergency exits, Police Chief John Welter said. The protest moved to downtown streets, where demonstrators blocked a major intersection and refused to move, Welter said. \"After allowing the crowd to protest for a couple of hours, the violence escalated to the point where an unlawful assembly was declared and the streets were then cleared of protesters,\" he said. Welter said officers made 24 arrests. Anaheim Police Sgt. Bob Dunn told CNN's \"Newsroom\" that once the protest was broken up, \"the crowds kind of moved around, sometimes fighting between each other, breaking windows and lighting fires and trash cans.\" Also Tuesday, the Diaz family filed a civil rights and wrongful death lawsuit against the city and the police department seeking $50 million in damages. The family cites witnesses who say Diaz was talking with two friends around 4 p.m. Saturday when a police car drove up with lights on \"and an intent to confront the young men.\" Diaz responded \"instinctively when he saw people chasing him and began to run,\" they say in the suit. The suit, filed in state court, says police shot the unarmed Diaz in the back and that when he fell, they shot him in the head and killed him. \"There is a racial and economic component to this shooting,\" said Dana Douglas, an attorney for the family. \"Police don't roust white kids in affluent neighborhoods who are just having a conversation. And those kids have no reason to fear police. But young men with brown skin in poor neighborhoods do. They are targeted by police, and something as simple as a friendly conversation is deemed 'suspicious activity' by police.\" Cell phone video taken at the scene of the incident and posted to YouTube showed police ordering bystanders to back away from the man lying face down on a lawn before they cordoned off the area with yellow police tape. Dozens of people surrounded the police officers; some threw objects at them and rolled a burning trash bin in their direction, according to CNN affiliate KTLA. Police responded with rubber bullets and pepper spray. One demonstrator showed the television news station bruises she said she got from rubber bullets fired at the crowd. The next day, protesters jammed the police department to complain about shootings involving police officers. But later the same night -- in a separate incident -- police shot and killed a second man, whom they also considered a gang member, when he allegedly fired at police, CNN affiliate KABC reported. Monday, hundreds held a vigil for Diaz, chanting in Spanish, according to KTLA. Dunn, the police sargeant said, said the Diaz shooting took place when officers in the \"high-crime gang neighborhood\" attempted to stop three men, who ran off. \"It was during that foot pursuit that the officer-involved shooting occurred,\" he said. \"The circumstances surrounding that shooting are under investigation by the district's attorney. Police in Anaheim were involved in six shootings in 2012, all but one of which were fatal, according to KTLA.",

    "input": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- World War II didn't just divide the world. It also divided four brothers. Ken (left) and Harry Akune served in the U.S. military during World War II. Not long after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Harry and Ken Akune were sent to live in an internment camp in Amache, Colorado. When the U.S. Army's Military Intelligence Service came to their camp to recruit Japanese-speaking volunteers as interpreters, they joined so they could prove their loyalty to their country. Across the world in Japan, their father Ichiro was raising the rest of his large family -- which had returned to his home country after the death of his wife -- in a fishing village, Kagoshima, on the island of Kyushu. The youngest brothers, Saburo and Shiro, were just teenagers when they were drafted into the Imperial Japanese Navy. The brothers, four of the Akunes' nine children, had all been born or raised in the United States; Ichiro Akune owned a grocery business before moving back to Japan. Harry and Ken had been sent back to America to work and earn money for the family.  Watch how brother fought brother during the war Â» . Harry and Ken graduated from language school in 1942 and were dispatched to the Pacific Theater. Ken served in Burma at the Office of War Information. His job was trying to create propaganda to persuade the Japanese to surrender rather than sacrifice their lives on the battlefield. Harry served in New Guinea and the Philippines. His ethnicity didn't endear him to some of his colleagues. \"I had an intelligence officer who disliked me,\" Harry recalled. Before a parachute jump onto the island of Corregidor with the 503rd Paratroopers late in the war, the officer stripped Harry of all of his gear, including his weapon. \"I got onto the airplane with only my parachute. A soldier took pity on me and helped find a rifle and one clip,\" he said. He survived, but many of his fellow soldiers did not. Twenty percent of them lost their lives just on the jump because of the jagged terrain and enemy fire. iReport.com: What did you do in the war? His work was heroic. Harry's interrogation of prisoners and translation of captured documents revealed a Japanese occupation force of over 5,000, which vastly outnumbered the American forces. \"My information helped reduce casualties,\" he said. Most of the Japanese soldiers chose death over what they perceived as dishonor. Harry says only 22 were captured, with the rest dying in combat or suicide attacks -- and they often weren't satisfied with dying alone. At one point, with Harry's back turned, a prisoner jumped him and tried to kill him. Harry recalls the incident vividly. \"My guard beat him with his gun. It seemed like this prisoner was clinging to me for dear life,\" he said. \"That feeling I have never lost. Even though he was the enemy, to see him die the way he did, affected me.\" The Japan-based Akune brothers saw death from the other perspective, as part of the war effort. Saburo became a spotter for kamikazes, known for their suicide dive-bomb missions on Allied ships. Shiro, just 15, served at Sasebo, a naval base, helping to orient new recruits. He remembers American Grumman torpedo planes flying into the harbor. \"Bap, bap, bap ... ships going down ... we just watching! We cannot do anything!\" he remembered. After the war, the Akune brothers discovered they served against each other, leading to ill feelings on both sides. Harry and Ken, now in Japan as members of the Allied Prisoner of War Recovery Team, joined Saburo and Shiro at a family reunion in Kagoshima. \"When we first met, the topic of the war came up. Both sides were saying their side was right,\" Ken said. \"Saburo and Shiro got really hot and stood up, they wanted to fight us.\" \"The propaganda situation in Japan was very extreme,\" Shiro said. \"The elders told you what you should do is revere the emperor like a god, and if you didn't abide by it, you were physically harmed.\" It took the intercession of their father to stop the familial battle. \"Shut up,\" the elder Akune said. \"The war is over.\" All four brothers ended up in the United States, with Shiro -- ironically -- serving as an American GI in Korea. Saburo died several years ago, but Shiro, Harry and Ken continue to live in Southern California. Ken still volunteers full time with the \"Go For Broke\" National Education Center, which preserves the memory of Japanese-American soldiers who served the United States in World War II. Harry says his military service helped him identify as an American. \"The benefit of going to war for the United States helped me manage myself not as a Japanese-American, but more like an American. I feel very happy I was able to do that,\" he said. But he holds nothing against the two brothers who fought for the other side. \"They were in Japan, educated there. It's only right to be loyal to the Japanese force,\" he said. \"I feel like they were like any other Japanese and we were like any other American. Two sides had their ideas, and there was a clash,\" he said. \"Everything worked out. All four of us were able to survive without having to be casualties of the war.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Hoffenheim have continued their dream start to the German Bundesliga season, beating Schalke 2-0 to remain top of the table with three wins out of three. The home side went into the half-time break with a one goal advantage, thanks to a header from Ghana defender Isaac Vorsah, who powered home a cross from captain Andreas Beck. It was Vorsah's second successive goal following his winning strike against St Pauli two weeks ago. And the points were sealed when German international goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was left helpless when Sejad Salihovic's free-kick struck the post, bounced off his chest, and flew into the net. The result leaves Hoffenheim with a 100 per cent record, although four other sides are also in that position going into the weekend's Bundesliga fixtures. However, big-spending Schalke, who gave a debut to Dutch international striker Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, are still without a point and struggling near the foot of the table, increasing the pressure on coach Felix Magath who nearly took the Blues to the Bundesliga title last season. \"I am satisfied with the game, we produced a good performance,\"  Magath told AFP. \"Unfortunately, we conceded two goals, that is unfortunate, but it can happen.\" Kaiserslautern, Mainz, Hamburg and Hanover can all join Hoffenheim at the top of the table on Saturday if they win their respective matches.

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- Death sentences plunged this year and the number of executions continued a steady decline as a result of \"growing discomfort\" felt by many Americans on the application of capital punishment. Only 78 people were sentenced to lethal injection so far this year, the first time that number has dropped below 100 since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976, according to a study published Thursday by the Death Penalty Information Center. Death sentences last year were at 112, and have declined by nearly 75% from 15 years ago, when more than 300 individuals were condemned. The center's annual report also showed only 43 people were executed in 2011, down three from last year, and a 56% decline from 12 years ago, when nearly a hundred people were put to death. \"This year, the use of the death penalty continued to decline by almost every measure,\" said Richard Dieter, the executive director of the center, which opposes the death penalty. He said executions, death sentences, public support and the number of states with the death penalty all dropped from previous years. \"Whether it's concerns about unfairness, executing the innocent, the high costs of the death penalty, or the general feeling that the government just can't get it right, Americans moved further away from capital punishment in 2011.\" In January, the Illinois legislature voted to repeal the death penalty, replacing it with a sentence of life without parole. In doing so, Illinois became the fourth state in four years to abandon capital punishment. The death penalty has now been abolished in 16 states. In November, Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber halted a pending execution and declared that no other executions would occur while he was in office. \"I am convinced we can find a better solution that keeps society safe, supports the victims of crime and their families and reflects Oregon values,\" he said. \"I refuse to be a part of this compromised and inequitable system any longer.\" But perhaps the loudest outcry was in Georgia, which executed Troy Davis despite serious doubts about his guilt and an international campaign to save his life. Thursday's report said the Davis case exposed the deep concerns over the death penalty. \"In many ways the death penalty today resembles the system struck down in 1972, when the (Supreme) Court could find no justification for the small number of death sentences and executions chosen arbitrarily from so many eligible cases,\" the report said. A CNN/Opinion Research Poll conducted in October found that for the first time in recent memory, more Americans favor a sentence of life in prison over the death penalty for murderers -- 50% to 48%. That's not to say that Americans want to abolish the death penalty entirely. Other polls have shown majorities generally favor it, but CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said his analysis shows there is a difference between thinking the government should have the death penalty as an option and actually wanting to see it applied. The decline in the number who prefer the death penalty as the punishment for murder may be related to the growing number who believe that at least one person in the past five years has been executed for a crime that he or she did not commit. In 2005, when a solid majority preferred the death penalty, 59% believed that an innocent person had been executed within the previous five years. Now that figure has risen dramatically, to 72%. Davis drew widespread support for his claims that an innocent man was being put to death, after federal and state courts had rejected his calls for a new trial. Since Davis' conviction in 1991, seven of the nine witnesses against him recanted their testimony, and no physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of a Savannah police officer. However, a federal judge concluded the death row inmate \"vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence.\" A Texas execution in July also attracted international attention. Mexican national Humberto Leal Garcia was convicted of raping and killing a 16-year-old girl. A world court found the state violated his rights by not giving Leal access to his home country's consulate upon his arrest in 1994, as required by an international treaty. U.S. and Mexican officials, along with a variety of human rights groups, urged Texas to delay the execution, but to no avail. Texas continues to lead the nation as the busiest death penalty state, with 13 executions this year. Alabama was next with six, and Ohio with five. No more are scheduled until next month. Thirty-four states have capital laws, but only 13 states carried out that ultimate punishment in 2011. In addition, several states with capital punishment laws did not sentence anyone to death in 2011, including Indiana, Maryland, Missouri and South Carolina. Another high-profile murder convict in Pennsylvania saw his death sentence commuted. Prosecutors decided this month not to give Mumia Abu-Jamal a new capital sentencing hearing. He was convicted of murdering Philadelphia police office Daniel Faulkner, but has long claimed his innocence as a victim of what he called a racist criminal justice system. He will spend the rest of his life in prison. California voters could decide next year whether to abandon the death penalty. That state has the highest death row population -- 721 people -- but no one has been executed there since 2006, when a court-ordered moratorium was declared. But one state that rarely has applied the death penalty could see two notorious killers receive that punishment. Steven Hayes was sentenced to death in Connecticut in December 2010, and a jury this month recommended the same punishment for Joshua Komisarjevsky. They were found guilty of home-invasion killings that left a mother and her two daughters dead. State legislators had contemplated abolishing capital punishment, but these defendants may have caused some rethinking, to allow the practice for only the worst of crimes. Connecticut and New Hampshire are the only New England states with the death penalty, but only one person has been executed in the region since 1960.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Archie Manning: Super Bowl XLIV is Sunday in Miami, Florida. The New Orleans Saints will face the Indianapolis Colts, and it's the first time the Saints have been in the Super Bowl in the team's four-decade history. Archie Manning is in an interesting situation. The quarterback was drafted by the Saints in 1971, and was hands-down the most famous and revered Saint, staying with them for ten years. He still has a home in New Orleans, Louisiana. Now his son, Peyton Manning, quarterback of the Colts, will face his father's old team, the team he grew up rooting for. Archie Manning and his wife, Olivia, raised three football-playing sons. Cooper, an all-state high school wide receiver and now a partner in an investment firm; Eli, who led the New York Giants to their Super Bowl win two years ago; and Peyton, who did the same for the Colts the year before that. Eli and Peyton both won MVP awards. A few weeks ago, Mike Chappell in the Indianapolis Star reported that Archie Manning said he plans to root for the Colts. \"I'm going to pull for my son,\" Archie said. \"(Saints coach) Sean Payton knows that. He's a great friend of mine. (Saints quarterback) Drew Brees knows that. That's just the way it is. Anybody who thinks it's different must not have children.\" Indy Star: Saints legend Archie Manning pulling for son, Colts . Robert Park: North Korea said Friday it was releasing the Korean-American missionary detained after reportedly illegally entering the country in December, state-run media reported. Tyong Park, Robert Park's father, said in San Diego, California, that he was \"so excited\" by the news but had no other information about his son's release. Robert Park told relatives before Christmas that he was trying to sneak into the isolated communist state to bring a message of \"Christ's love and forgiveness\" to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. After an investigation, North Korean authorities \"decided to leniently forgive and release him, taking his admission and sincere repentance of his wrong doings into consideration,\" the state-run Korea Central News Agency said. During an interview with North Korean authorities, Park reportedly told investigators that \"he was taken in by the false rumor spread by the West and committed a criminal act in the end.\" Park said he heard stories of concentration camps and of mass killings, prompting him to go to North Korea to help, the news agency said. A South Korean Web site in December posted a copy of the letter it said Park was trying to deliver to Kim, urging the North Korean leader to free political prisoners and \"open your borders so that we may bring food, provisions, medicine, necessities, and assistance to those who are struggling to survive.\" But according to the North Korean news agency, once Park was in North Korea he said he was treated well and allowed to attend church and pray freely.

The Los Angeles Times reports that Joe Lombardi, 38, never met his famous grandfather; he was born a year after his death in 1970. Lombardi, the quarterbacks coach for the New Orleans Saints, told the newspaper that he had seen a quote from his grandfather saying he wished he had never said \"Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing,\" and that he feels Vince was misinterpreted. \"I think his point was that certainly your goal is to win, but it's the process that you take in order to get there, the will to win, the will to prepare -- doing everything in your control in order to put yourself in position to win at anything. And I think that's what his point was, more so than win at all costs, even if you've got to cheat or cut corners,\" Joe Lombardi told the Los Angeles Times. L.A. Times: Saints have a Lombardi, and now they want a trophy . Jenny Sanford: \"Staying True\" by Sanford, who in December filed for divorce from South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, will be available in bookstores Friday. Reporters exposed the governor's affair with an Argentine woman after he disappeared for several days last summer. Staffers said he was hiking the Appalachian Trail. Sanford later admitted he was actually in Argentina with his mistress. Rather than standing by their men, wives of morally challenged politicians are now publicly opting to let their husbands clean up their own messes. That is one reason why former investment banker Jenny Sanford wrote her book, publisher Ballantine Books says on its Web site. \"She chose to let Mark Sanford deal with the embarrassment and political fallout from his own actions while focusing her own efforts privately on raising their children to be men of character, even in the face of the lies their father has told,\" says the synopsis of her book on the site. CNN: Silent no more, wives go public about husbands' affairs . D.A. Powell: Claremont Graduate University in Southern California announced this week that D.A. Powell has won the $100,000 Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award for his book \"Chronic.\" Powell teaches at the University of San Francisco and lives in the Bay Area of California. According to the Poetry Foundation, Powell was born in 1963 in Albany, Georgia. When he was teaching at Sonoma State, he noticed that many of his students wrote poems that somehow fit the size of the page they were working on, so he began experimenting with his students. What difference would it make if words were written on a candlestick or a roll of toilet paper? When he wrote the first poem for his book, \"Tea,\" he turned his legal pad sideways and began writing longer lines of poetry. Powell receives his prize this April. Here's an excerpt from his poem, \"Chronic:\" I carry the same baffled heart I have always carried / a bit more battered than before, a bit less joy / for I see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere / by the open air, I swore out my list of pleasures: / sprig of lilac, scent of pine / the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch...\" Claremont Graduate University: D.A. Powell wins Kingsley Tufts Poetry Award . Poetry Foundation: Poet biography . Poetry Daily: \"Chronic\" What makes a person intriguing? There are people who enter the news cycle every day because their actions or decisions are new, important or different. Others are in the news because they are the ones those decisions affect. And there are a number of people who are so famous or controversial that anything they say or do becomes news. Some of these people do what we expect of them: They run for office, pass legislation, start a business, get hired or fired, commit a crime, make an arrest, get in accidents, hit a home run, overthrow a government, fight wars, sue an opponent, put out fires, prepare for hurricanes and cavort with people other than their spouses. They do make news, but the action is usually more important than who is involved in the story. But every day, there are a number of people who become fascinating to us -- by virtue of their character, how they reached their decision, how they behaved under pressure or because of the remarkable circumstances surrounding the event they are involved in. They arouse our curiosity. We hear about them and want to know more. What they have done or said stimulates conversations across the country. At times, there is even a mystery about them. What they have done may be unique, heroic, cowardly or ghastly, but they capture our imaginations. We want to know what makes them tick, why they believe what they do, and why they did what they did. They intrigue us.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Five people were detained off Somalia's coast Wednesday after pirates mistook a French ship involved in an anti-piracy operation for a commercial vessel, the French Defense Ministry said. A German-flagged warship taking part in the EU's anti-piracy mission is pictured in this April 2009 file photo. There were no injuries as a result of the attack on the BCR Somme, the ministry said. The pirates opened fire at midnight local time, about 250 nautical miles (463 kilometers) off Somalia's coast, officials added. An hour after the attack, the French command and supply ship chased down one of the pirates' skiffs, and detained five suspected pirates, it said. A second skiff involved in the attack got away. The BCR Somme was carrying supplies off Somalia's coast to forces involved in the European anti-piracy operation, called \"Atalante,\" the ministry said. Europe and other Western powers have stepped up their maritime patrols off Somalia's coast following a spate of pirate attacks over the past year. Somalia's transitional government, which has a tenuous grip on power, has been unable to stop the pirates, many of whom are based in Somalia's port cities. Those who have tracked pirate activity say it started in the 1980s in Somalia, when the pirates claimed they were aiming to stop the rampant illegal fishing and dumping that continues to this day off the Somali coast. Piracy accelerated after the fall of the Somali government in the early 1990s and began to flourish after shipping companies started paying ransoms. Those payments started out being in the tens of thousands of dollars and have since climbed into the millions. Some experts say companies are simply making the problem worse by paying the pirates.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- \"I'm going to appoint Thurgood Marshall to the (Supreme) Court.\" This monumental, unexpected bombshell from President Lyndon Johnson -- spoken in private in the summer of 1965 -- set in motion a history-making drama, revealed for the first time in newly public audio tapes. In secret recordings and transcripts made exclusive to CNN, Johnson laid out a politically crafty plan that was years in the making to groom Marshall as the first African-American on the high court. It was part of a broader White House strategy to implement the president's civil rights agenda, something he openly hoped would cement his legacy and strengthen the Democrats' base. Marshall was unaware of all this when Johnson first called him on July 7, 1965. Marshall, then a federal appeals court judge in New York, had been summoned from lunch. The president, a master persuader, wastes little time making his point: . \"I have a rather big problem that I wanted to talk to you about,\" he says. \"I want you to give it some real thought because it's something that I have thought about for weeks, and I think that we can't think of how it affects us personally. We've got to think about the world, and our country.\" \"Yes, sir,\" Marshall replies, the usually verbose judge unable to get many more words in the conversation. Johnson then makes the pitch: \"I want you to be my solicitor general.\" \"Wow,\" is all Marshall can say, clearly in disbelief. \"I want the top lawyer in the United States representing me before the Supreme Court to be a negro. And be a damn good lawyer that's done it before. So you have those peculiar qualifications.\" He adds, \"I want to do this job that [Abraham] Lincoln started, and I want to do it the right way.\" Leaving the security of a lifetime job on the bench for an uncertain political post -- where he could be fired at any time -- at first concerns Marshall, who asks for a day or two to think about the offer. But minutes later, he is sold. \"The answer's 'yes.' \" 'Do it for the people of the world' Then the president offers a tantalizing hint of bigger things to come. \"Nobody will ever know I talked to you. If you decide that you can do it, I think you ought to do it for the people of the world. ... And if there's not something better, which I would hope there would be, that you would be more amenable to, there'll be security for you because I'm going to be here for quite awhile,\" he says confidently. That \"something,\" as later conversations that Johnson has with top aides reveals, is a Supreme Court appointment. It would come two years later in 1967. The solicitor general spot would be a mere prelude to a bigger stage. The tapes are being released by the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, which is analyzing and transcribing secret White House tapes from the Franklin Delano Roosevelt to the Richard Nixon years. This latest disclosure comes as Justice Marshall is receiving a fresh burst of attention, thanks to a new play on his life starring award-winning actor Laurence Fishburne. His amazing transformation into the civil rights icon is stunning. HBO will air the play Thursday, videotaped from a performance this past summer at Washington's Kennedy Center. Fishburne told CNN his is an honest portrayal. \"It's all there,\" he said of Marshall, whom he never met. \"I mean, we deal with his flaws and we deal with his strengths. We deal with his history; we deal with his disappointments as well as his victories. So, it's all there. It's all there in the show. Warts and all.\" Building on an already strong legacy . Marshall had already cemented his legacy as a pioneering NAACP lawyer who won 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the justices, his future colleagues. That included Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark ruling ending segregation in public schools. By the time of his government appointments, Marshall was in his mid-50s and itching for new challenges. Less than two weeks after his new job offer, Johnson secretly makes clear he wants more for Marshall. On July 20, 1965, the president tells economist and informal adviser John Kenneth Galbraith about a pending Supreme Court vacancy that will ultimately go to Johnson friend Abe Fortas. But Johnson is already laying the groundwork for the next court seat. \"I'm going to appoint Thurgood Marshall to the (Supreme) Court,\" LBJ says flatly. \"Not to succeed him (current Justice Arthur Goldberg), but after he's solicitor (general) for a year. After he's solicitor (general) for a year or two, the first vacancy I have. I haven't told anybody that, and I don't want you to, but I brought him here.\" Johnson mentions how Southern Senate Democrats held up Marshall's 1961 appointment to the federal appeals bench for months. The president now believes with Marshall's proven skill as a legal advocate, he would make a good solicitor general, arguing cases on behalf of the federal government before the high court. \"At the end of a year or two,\" in his new job, Johnson predicts, \"no one can say that he's not one of the best-qualified men that has ever [been] appointed. And then I'm going to appoint him\" to the high court. Going to Marshall for advice . With a relationship established, Johnson was not shy about calling on his new solicitor general for some practical political advice. Marshall is asked to suggest names of other black leaders suitable for top administration posts, including agency heads and ambassadorships. The solicitor general suggests Whitney Young, Franklin Williams and Roy Wilkins. Marshall, despite being among just a handful of top black officials in the administration, appears slightly uncomfortable seeming to speak for all African-Americans in a purely political context. \"You got any suggestions, things we ought to be doing in this Negro field that we're not? I see that they say they're getting very disillusioned with Johnson,\" says the president, referring to himself in the third person. \"Well, I'm going to get together with some of them within the two-week period and try to find out what's going on,\" replies Marshall. \"I'm having great difficulty in finding out what they want.\" That comment may reflect the internal divisions among many in the civil rights movement over direction and strategy in the wake of passage of the Civil Rights Act, Voting Rights Act and the Rev. Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech just a few years earlier. But it is clear from this conversation that LBJ is using Marshall's grooming for the Supreme Court as the model he will use to boost other outstanding African American candidates to senior government positions. By October 1966, some in the Johnson circle had begun quietly offering trial balloons in the press over whether Marshall might be a suitable justice. One U.S. News & World Report writer suggested he would not. \"Did you see the column today by David Lawrence?\" Johnson asks Nicholas Katzenbach, his former attorney general. \"He's got a mean -- saying that Thurgood's not the best-qualified man. That's the net of it.\" In a later conversation, Johnson's reveals Marshall remains on his mind, and he reaches out to key lawmakers and civil rights leaders for their advice. \"I want to build him up where he's impenetrable when he becomes a Supreme Court justice,\" says the president. But he adds the future nominee knows nothing of this. \"I've never told him I'm going to appoint him, and don't know that I am. But he's damn sure going to be qualified.\" Opportunity knocks for Johnson . When Justice Tom Clark announced his retirement, the president was ready to make his move. On June 13, 1967, just moments before he separately calls Marshall to be his nominee, Johnson tells Attorney General Ramsey Clark -- whose father Marshall was about to replace -- of his plans. He dismisses whispers from some in Washington that Marshall is not ready to sit on the nation's highest court. \"He doesn't fit the mold. He's not a Yale man and that kind of stuff, you know,\" says Clark helpfully. \"Just a big, easy-going, very humane-type person. He doesn't change his behavior to suit other people. Doesn't wear striped pants. I think it's a combination of those two factors\" the public will embrace. The two men discuss how the Senate Judiciary Committee will treat Marshall, who will be ultimately confirmed later that summer. The day after the historic 69-11 Senate vote, Marshall's wife, Cecilia, known as Cissy to her friends, calls the president personally to thank him. \"Now that I have stopped trembling a little, and now that we're more or less legal, I thought I'd like to call you and thank you again so much for the faith you have shown in Thurgood and so much that you have done for everybody.\" Johnson replies in a sweet, soft voice, \"Well, I know he'll be very worthy of it, and I know that both of us will be proud of him.\" Marshall served on the Supreme Court until 1991. He died in early 1993.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A North Carolina man accused of plotting to wage holy war overseas also planned to attack the U.S. Marine base at Quantico, Virginia, according to new charges announced Thursday. Daniel Boyd previously was charged with conspiracy to support terrorists and conspiracy to murder. The charge is one of three counts in a new indictment against Daniel Patrick Boyd, who authorities allege is the ringleader of a group of men charged with training in North Carolina for a \"violent jihad.\" Boyd and another man, Hysen Sherifi, are charged with conspiring to murder U.S. military personnel. \"Boyd undertook reconnaissance of the Marine Corps Base located in Quantico, Virginia, and obtained maps of the base in order to plan an attack on Quantico,\" the charges state. FBI agents found weapons, thousands of rounds of ammunition and $13,000 cash in Boyd's Raleigh-area home, an FBI agent testified at an August bond hearing for the men, who were arrested in late July. The original indictment says the men practiced military tactics in a North Carolina county that borders Virginia. The latest indictment also charges Boyd, Sherifi, and Boyd's son Zakariya with possession of weapons in furtherance of a crime of violence, while Boyd faces an additional charge of providing a rifle and ammunition to a convicted felon. Boyd and seven others already have been charged with conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists and conspiracy to murder, kidnap, maim and injure people. One of the men is believed to have fled to Pakistan, and the remaining men are in custody. In August, a federal judge denied bail for the seven in custody, but expressed skepticism about the charges against them. Magistrate Judge William Webb said the defendants made a number statements espousing holy war, and said the statements could be interpreted in isolation as braggadocio. But he agreed to keep them in jail because some of them had amassed a large arsenal and engaged in firearms training.",

    "input": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- For the second time in two days, a deadly blast shook a northwest Pakistani city as worshippers marked the sacred holiday of Ashura. The explosion occurred near a Shiite Muslim procession in Dera Ismail Khan. The bomb was planted inside a bicycle repair shop, killing five people and injuring more than 70 others, said Mian Iftikahr Hussain, the provincial information minister. A spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban said the group was behind Sunday's bombing on the procession and warned of more attacks. A day earlier, the Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for a blast that killed seven people, including three children, during a Shiite religious procession in the same city Saturday. That bomb was planted in a garbage container and exploded as the last section of the procession, in which children were following adults, was passing by, police spokesman Khalid Sohail said. Eighteen people, including five children and two police officials, were wounded in Saturday's attack. The spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, Ihsanullah Ihsan, said the group would continue \"its mission\" and attack Shiite Ashura processions across Pakistan. Pakistan has been on high alert because of the two-day holiday of Ashura, in which believers mourn the death of a key imam from the 7th century. The government increased security for the Ashura observance. Taliban claim blasts killing dozens in Pakistan . Shia Islam is a minority sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim country, and its members face persecution from extremists. The Pakistani Taliban took responsibility for similar attacks earlier this week. Interior Minister Rehman Malik temporarily blocked cell phone services in cities, where gathered intelligence indicated the possibility of bombs detonated by cell phone. He also banned motor bikes, often used to conceal bombs, for two days in some cities. Malik said the safeguards were specifically meant to protect Shiites. Pakistan Taliban threaten to target India after execution of Mumbai attacker . Despite heightened security, at least 31 people were killed and 68 wounded in multiple bomb attacks Wednesday. A Taliban spokesman said those attacks targeted Shiites, whom the terrorists believe denigrate the Prophet Mohammed with their religious observance. Ashura commemorates the death of the Prophet Mohammed's grandson, killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680 AD. The battle and subsequent death of Imam Hussein caused the split between Shiite and Sunni Muslims.",

    "input": "SAN DIEGO, California (CNN)  -- What if we offered illegal immigrants a path to citizenship that included a stint in the U.S. military? Ruben Navarrette: Be wary of offering military service as a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. The idea has been trumpeted by thoughtful people such as Max Boot, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who thinks this is the time for a \"freedom legion.\" He's talking about a unit of the military made up entirely of the foreign-born -- including illegal immigrants -- where the compensation would include U.S. citizenship. About 70,000 foreign-born men and women serve in the U.S. armed forces, or about 5 percent of the total active-duty force, according to the Pentagon. Of those, nearly 30,000 -- or about 43 percent -- are not U.S. citizens. Roping illegal immigrants into military service could accomplish two goals at once: helping alleviate the military's recruitment worries while giving the undocumented a chance to prove that their commitment to this country extends beyond a paycheck. We're already talking about requiring illegal immigrants to learn English, pay fines, and return to their home countries to earn legal status. Why not, some say, raise the stakes and require men and women between 18 and 42 to serve a couple of years in the military to earn something even more precious: U.S. citizenship for themselves and their children? The idea appealed to a reader in upstate New York who called me to gauge my reaction. I told him that I hadn't made up my mind, but that the concept did fit with my view that any conferring of legal status be laden with onerous conditions so that it really is earned. To earn it, illegal immigrants should have to do everything but walk across broken glass. Still, I told him, I'm not sure how those who oppose comprehensive reform but support turning illegal immigrants into cannon fodder go about squaring that circle. Restrictionists and racists have argued that illegal immigrants are invading this country, and that they're a dangerous menace to society that is prone to all sorts of violent and criminal behavior. Of course, many native-born U.S. citizens are just as menacing. But for those who believe that illegal immigrants are inherently violent, do they really want to give these folks military training and a M-16, to help them graduate from menacing to lethal? After all, assuming they survive their stint in the military, they eventually have to return stateside. Then they're our problem. Consider the ghastly events in Newark, New Jersey, where three African-American students were killed execution-style and a fourth was shot in the head but survived. The accused ringleader is Jose Carranza, an illegal immigrant from Peru, who was previously charged with raping a 5-year-old girl and threatening her parents. Twice indicted by grand juries, Carranza slipped through the cracks and was released on bail. Authorities say that the 28-year-old construction worker led at least four other individuals in attacking the youths with a gun and a machete. If convicted, Carranza could get the death penalty. Glad to hear it. If half the things they say about this creep are true, Carranza belongs on death row. But guess what? He sure doesn't belong on an Army recruitment poster, or handling heavy artillery.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Samuel Sanchez finally won his first stage at the Tour de France on Thursday, but the title hopes of his fellow Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador suffered a surprise blow as the race headed into the mountains. Sanchez was fourth in the sport's biggest event last year, but found himself more than five minutes behind leader Thomas Voeckler going into the 12th leg from Cugnaux to Luz Ardiden. However, the 2008 Olympic road race champion sped clear of the bunch of escaped riders going into the final ascent along with Jelle Vanendert, and the 33-year-old held off the Belgian for a memorable victory by seven seconds in the Pyrenees. It came almost 10 years after his Basque-based Euskaltel team's first stage win at Le Tour, also at Luz Ardiden. Cavendish sprints to third win of 2011 Tour de France . \"I knew it was an important day, and I had to try something because I was late to my position in the general classification meant that I was not a dangerous rival for some of the GC riders,\" Sanchez told the race website. \"I had my chance and I decided to go. I was also aware that Andy Schleck had lost a lot of teammates and so did Alberto Contador, so they were not able to reel in our escape.\" Sanchez came in 50 seconds ahead of Voeckler, who retained the yellow jersey after placing ninth. Defending Contador, seeking a fourth title, was eighth as he lost time on his main rivals to be four minutes adrift overall with nine stages left. \"I had a really sore knee, it was bothering me so I'm happy with the result even if I did concede a few seconds. I couldn't do any better,\" he said. \"I've been feeling the effects of those crashes in the first week, my pedal stroke hasn't been great. But I'm sure things are going to improve. The engine is taking some time to warm up but I think everyone is feeling tired and I hope that will play to my advantage.\" Voeckler kept his lead of one minute and 49 seconds, though Luxembourg's Frank Schleck moved up to second place as he finished third -- 10 seconds behind Sanchez. Two-time runner-up Cadel Evans of Australia was 30 seconds behind the winner in fifth to be third overall, 2:06 behind Voeckler. Andy Schleck, who lost out to Contador last year after a controversial chain-break incident, was left 2:17 adrift after finishing sixth in the same time as Evans and Italy's Ivan Basso, who was fifth overall with a deficit of 3:16. Voeckler was happy after keeping pace with the stage leaders until 1,800 meters from the end. \"I was a little bit afraid when I crashed at the top of the first climb. I'm normally not so bad in the downhill but I was very scared this time. The road was very slippery and I decided to change my bike and that helped,\" said the Frenchman, who has held the maillot jaune since finishing second in stage nine. \"On the final climb, I was still in the race along with the best climbers. I told myself, 'Keep going! Keep going!' And Pierre Rolland gave me a great hand in the final -- he really helped me. My legs felt good but it was the great job done by the Europcar team that really helped me today.\" Thursday's stage winner Mark Cavendish was more than half an hour off the pace in 153rd, but retained the sprinters' green jersey as he extended his lead to 18 points from Spain's Jose Joaquin Rojas. Sanchez won the climbers' polka-dot jersey for King of the Mountains, while the Schlecks' Leopard-Trek lead the teams.

South African Airways said it has a zero-tolerance approach towards any criminal activity. The 10 women and five men -- who include three pilots -- were detained on arrival from Johannesburg, South Africa, after customs officials found 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of marijuana and 4 kilograms (8.8 pounds) of cocaine in three pieces of baggage, HM Revenue and Customs said. The drugs are estimated to be worth a total of Â£310,000 ($428,000), customs officials added. Border agents arrested the crew at London's Heathrow Airport on suspicion of involvement in smuggling prohibited drugs into the United Kingdom, customs spokesman Bob Gaiger said. He said he was not able to disclose what led investigators to believe the suitcases belonged to the crew members. Customs officials interviewed the crew members overnight, and all were released on bail Wednesday pending further inquiries, Gaiger said. They were not charged, according to the airline.

NASA says new data on so-called solar tsunamis will help predict how they will affect our planet. The tsunamis -- powerful explosions known as coronal mass ejections, or CMEs -- produce solar cosmic rays that can interfere with technology, causing power blackouts and disrupting air traffic communications and cell phone networks. NASA says images captured by its twin Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, spacecraft have enabled scientists to map the tsunamis in 3D to examine their structure, velocity, mass and direction. The solar ejections, its says, can release billions of tons of high-velocity plasma into space, producing a shockwave that generates cosmic rays which then plow into our atmosphere. These can create the brightly-colored auroras, more commonly known as the Northern or Southern lights, but also have more damaging effects, posing particular threats to spacecraft and astronauts. Solar physicist Angelos Vourlidas of the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington said the new data from the STEREO craft -- launched into orbit in October 2006 -- will revolutionize the study of cosmic weather patterns. \"Before this unique mission, measurements and the subsequent data of a CME observed near the sun had to wait until the ejections arrived at Earth three to seven days later,\" he said in statement. \"Now we can see a CME from the time it leaves the solar surface until it reaches Earth and we can reconstruct the event in 3D directly from the images.\"",

    "input": "Perugia, Italy (CNN) -- Amanda Knox and former boyfriend Rafael Sollecito are killers and the evidence proves it, a prosecutor insisted Friday in wrapping up her statement in the duo's appeal of their 2009 murder convictions. Knox and Sollecito were convicted of killing Knox's former roommate, Meredith Kercher, in a bloody crime that left the victim half-naked with her throat slashed. Knox's attorneys argued in their closing arguments Thursday that police had made numerous mistakes investigating the crime and that evidence didn't support the convictions. But prosecutor Manuela Comodi said the evidence is clear, from bloody footprints with particular characteristics that match the two to the very spot where Knox's DNA was found on a kitchen knife believed by investigators to be the murder weapon. \"They are young, but so was Meredith. They've murdered. And they have killed for nothing. And for this they must be condemned to the maximum sentence,\" Comodi said. The hearing was expected to continue Friday with an attorney for Kercher's family addressing the court. No ruling is expected until Monday, when Knox and Sollecito are expected to give final statements, according to the judge. At Friday's hearing, prosecutor Giuliano Mignini said Knox and Sollecito tried to blame the killing on another co-defendant, Rudy Guede, because Guede is black. Guede was also convicted in the case and is already serving a 16-year sentence. Comodi, showed jurors a photograph of a bloody footprint found in the bathroom of the home were Kercher was killed. There was no way the footprint was Guede's as defense attorneys had contended, Comodi argued. Comodi said experts have concluded that the footprint was not Guede's and probably was Sollecito. She also told the court that just because the footprint was found \"not usable\" for positive identification, it doesn't mean that they are \"non usable'\" when you can do a process of elimination. Comodi also used her microphone to demonstrate the how the location where Knox's DNA was found on the presumed murder weapon -- at the junction between the blade and the handle -- suggests a stabbing motion, rather than a cutting motion. On Thursday, Knox's attorneys gave their final arguments to counter prosecutors' portrayal of her as a cunning \"femme fatale.\" Lawyer Carlo Dalla Vedova told the jury \"that the only possible decision to take is that of absolving Amanda Knox,\" as he wrapped up his closing argument. He said the court had seen no trace of Amanda Knox in the room where the murder took place. Another one of Knox's lawyers, Luciano Ghirga, said she was \"very afraid but her heart is full of hope\" that she will be freed. Her \"image was massacred\" by the media and the attacks on her character started before the trial, he said, adding that he considered her as a daughter. Concluding an emotional appearance, he appealed to the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Knox's family -- a counterpoise to the words of appeals court prosecutor Giancarlo Costagliola, who asked the jury to put themselves in the shoes of Kercher's family at the start of the closing arguments a week ago. The \"clan Knox\" -- as Knox's family have been referred to -- are not part of some rumored U.S. conspiracy to put pressure on the Italian courts to release her, Ghirga said. Rather, \"they are parents and they deserve respect.\" The lawyer also praised the court's work, saying he felt Knox's rights had finally been respected. Urging the jury not to let innocent people stay in jail, Vedova earlier detailed what he called many \"mistakes\" made in the investigation into Kercher's death. When Knox was arrested and interrogated, she was not allowed a translator and was discouraged from getting a lawyer, Vedova said. \"'That night Amanda Knox's right to defend herself was denied,\" he said. \"She was just a young girl, first time out of the country. She didn't speak Italian.\" Vedova argued that some of the DNA evidence presented by the prosecution should be thrown out. He said some material was contaminated as a result of poor practice by police, including supposed traces of mixed blood in the bathroom sink shared by the two girls. The prosecution's use of alleged bloody footprints in their case was also wrong, he said. As for the knife used to kill Kercher, a key piece of evidence, Vedova told the court there was a \"concentration of nothingness, a fantasy\" in the prosecution's arguments. He ridiculed a theory that Sollecito had not disposed of the knife because he was concerned his landlady would notice it was missing, asking: \"What kind of a killer would think about this after committing a murder?\" Knox and Sollecito were convicted in 2009. Knox was sentenced to 26 years in prison, while Sollecito got 25. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Robin Stearns, 28, watched her husband apply for jobs day in and day out. She watched him scour professional networking sites in an attempt to contact prospective employers. Robin Stearns created a Web site to draw employers' attention to her jobless husband, Michael. No response. Then an idea came to her: Why not make him stand out by starting a Web site devoted to helping him find a job? She used her tax refund to buy a MacBook, which came with a Web site building feature. A few days later, myhusbandneedsajob.com was born. \"I grew frustrated. He has been sending out resumes since he graduated but nothing has happened,\" the San Francisco, California, resident said. \"He's such a great candidate, he would be an asset to any company.\" Michael Stearns, 30, earned his master's in business administration from Georgetown University in Washington in May 2008. He says he is \"basically looking to get into a corporate marketing environment\" but is willing to try anything reasonable. The site features a picture of Robin Stearns holding a sign begging for somebody to employ her husband. It also displays his resume and a profile interview and other features. As the economy tumbles and unemployment rates soar, the jobless are using creativity to make themselves stand out. Paul Forster, co-founder and CEO of the job search site Indeed.com, urges candidates to employ measures that separate them from the masses rather than blanketing the job market with resumes. \"Don't resort to the shotgun approach,\" Forster advises.  Watch adults crash a teen job fair Â» . The Internet has given job seekers an extra tool to reach out to employers. Social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook are filled with public groups that share tips on job openings. Blogs focusing on support for the jobless are plentiful, too, helping people realize they are not alone. For the Stearnses, defying a pack mentality and using a different approach seems to have made a difference. The site, which has been up for about three days, has brought dozens of e-mails from both employers and other people in a similar situation. Michael Stearns said he plans to follow up on the job opportunities. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, California has one of the nation's highest unemployment rates at 10.1 percent. The national rate is 8.1 percent. Robin Stearns, who declined to discuss her job because she wants to focus on her husband's job search, says a lot of their friends have been victims of the economy. \"Almost 90 percent of people we know have been affected by layoffs,\" she said. The couple plans to leave the site up for now. \"At least until I get a job,\" Michael Stearns said. CNNMoney.com staff writer Jessica Dickler contributed to this report.",

    "input": "New York (CNN) -- Last night, police raided and evicted protesters from the Occupy Wall Street site. This comes on the heels of recent police crackdowns on Occupy encampments all across the country. But if you think that's the end of the 99% movement, guess again. It's still just getting started. To be clear, the Occupy camps are for the most part rigorously and passionately nonviolent and, incidentally, much cleaner than most would expect. But there are a few punks in the crowds, mixed in with some who have sought shelter in the camps who bring along struggles with mental illness or drug addiction. In other words, the 99% movement isn't violent; sadly, our society in general can be violent, and that violence seeps into even the most well-meaning spaces. And enemies of the middle class would use any ammunition they could find to attack the 99% movement and evict the protesters. Nonetheless, the Occupy camps gave urgent birth to a movement that was long-gestating in the anger and frustration of ordinary Americans. Now that it's been kicked out of the house, it's time for the 99% movement to grow up. Movements are, of course, always moving -- and so it's impossible to predict where they will go. But I expect a couple of key shifts in the coming weeks. Judge orders New York to allow protesters, tents, in park . First, look for the 99% movement to move away from the \"occupy\" tactic. Holding public ground for public protests has captured the attention of the nation in a way few other protests ever have. But behind the scenes, protesters were increasingly worried that the problems associated with the camps are starting to outweigh the benefits. Plus it's getting damn cold out and, even in nice weather, the Occupy sites take a lot of energy to maintain. No movement should be beholden to a limited set of tactics. The colonial Americans didn't just keep throwing boxes of tea into bodies of water. The civil rights protesters didn't stop at sit-ins and bus boycotts. Similar to the \"Move Your Money\" campaign calling on the 99% to divest their checking and savings accounts from the top job-killing banks on Wall Street, I think we'll start to see more experimental tactics that draw on mass action and public engagement without necessarily being rooted in outdoor sleepovers. This will be messy at first, with many misses and few hits, but is an essential next step if the 99% movement is to continue. Second, look for leaders to emerge. The Occupy camps have been fervent in their supposedly leaderless structures, frustrating critics and media observers alike. But, as keen analysts have observed, the 99% movement is, in fact, leader-full -- creating opportunities for everyday Americans who've felt cast out of the political process to find their voice and vision and work with others to achieve their goals. The movement isn't anti-leadership but rather pro-leadership to the point where it's investing in building the power and skills of thousands of new leaders. Yet given the practical limitations to an entirely decentralized, consensus-based decision-making process (which, among other things, allows a few vocal yahoos in favor of property destruction to have too much sway), clusters of leaders will start to emerge in the struggle to define the movement's next phase. But don't expect them to look anything like the \"leaders\" we're used to. Instead, they'll include single moms and construction workers and recent college graduates and homeless people. Because of who they are and the way they lead in the context of the larger movement, they will redefine our understanding of leadership. Third, wait for factions to splinter. While we'd all love to keep holding hands and singing \"Kumbaya,\" the reality is that as the 99% movement gets bigger, so do the stakes and various differences and divisions that once seemed trivial become impossible to ignore. The small minority within the protests who are eager to vandalize property and confront police will, let's hope, be sidelined and that their reckless acts will be seen as doing violence to the larger mission of the movement. Of course, it would be great if these small factions could be educated and transformed, but the reality is that in every movement, left and right, there's a fringe and, ultimately, a moment where that fringe is no longer accommodated but rejected. The raids and evictions may be the impetus for this shift in the 99% movement. Whatever happens next, it's clear that the movement to make our economy and political system work for the 99% has barely completed the first 1% of its long and vital journey. You can evict protesters, but you can never evict a growing idea. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Sally Kohn.",

    "input": "SEATTLE, Washington (CNN) -- Ann Holmes Redding has what could be called a crisis of faiths. Ann Holmes Redding says she sees no contradiction in being both a Christian minister and a Muslim. For nearly 30 years, Redding has been an ordained minister in the Episcopal Church. Her priesthood ended Wednesday when she was defrocked. The reason? For the past three years Redding has been both a practicing Christian and a Muslim. \"Had anyone told me in February 2006 that I would be a Muslim before April rolled around, I would have shaken my head in concern for the person's mental health,\" Redding recently told a crowd at a signing for a book she co-authored on religion. Redding said her conversion to Islam was sparked by an interfaith gathering she attended three years ago. During the meeting, an imam demonstrated Muslim chants and meditation to the group. Redding said the beauty of the moment and the imam's humbleness before God stuck with her. \"It was much more this overwhelming conviction that I needed to surrender to God and this was the form that my surrender needed to take,\" she recalled. \"It wasn't just an episode but .... was a step that I wasn't going to step back from.\" Ten days later Redding was saying the shahada -- the Muslim declaration of belief in the oneness of God and acceptance of Mohammad as his prophet. But Redding said she felt her new Muslim faith did not pose a contradiction to her staying a Christian and minister. \"Both religions say there's only one God,\" Redding said, \"and that God is the same God. It's very clear we are talking about the same God! So I haven't shifted my allegiance.\"  Watch Redding say, \"Being a Muslim makes me a better Christian\" Â» . The imam at the Islamic Center in Seattle, Washington, where Redding prays said she brings the best of both traditions to her beliefs. \"Coming from an example of wanting to be Christ-like and coming from the perspective of wanting to follow the best example -- the example of our prophet Mohammed -- it all makes sense then,\" Benjamin Shabazz said. There are many contradictions between the two religions. While Islam recognizes Jesus as a prophet, Christianity worships him as the son of God. James Wellman, who chairs the department of comparative religion at the University of Washington, said that while it is not unusual for people to \"mix and match\" beliefs, it is almost unheard of for a minister to claim two religions. \"When you take ordination as a Christian minister, you take an explicit vow of loyalty to Jesus. It's hard for me to understand how a Christian minister could have dual loyalties,\" Wellman said. Redding said she sees the theological conflicts but that the two religions, at their core, \"illuminate\" each other. \"When I took my shahada, I said there's no God but God and that Mohammed is God's prophet or messenger. Neither of those statements, neither part of that confession or profession denies anything about Christianity,\" she said. To her parishioners and family, though, Redding has turned her back on her faith and office. There was, she said, \"universal puzzlement\" at her decision to convert to Islam but still remain an Episcopal minister. \"I have people who love me very much who really don't want me to do this, and I love them very much. And I would love to be able to say, 'Because I love you I will renounce my orders' or 'I will renounce Islam' ... I hate causing pain to people who love me, that's not my intention,\" Redding said. The Episcopal Church also rejected Redding's religious choice. \"The church interprets my being a Muslim as 'abandoning the church,' \" she said. \"And that [there] comes an understanding that you have to be one or the other, and most people would say that. It simply hasn't been my experience that I have to make a choice between the two.\" The Diocese of Rhode Island, where Redding was ordained, told her to leave either her new Muslim faith or the ministry. A diocese statement said Bishop Geralyn Wolf found Redding to be \"a woman of utmost integrity. However, the Bishop believes that a priest of the Church cannot be both a Christian and a Muslim.\" Even though she has been defrocked, Redding said she is not capable of turning her back on either faith. She said she wants to continue speaking about and teaching religion and perhaps even travel to the Hajj, a journey to Mecca that every Muslim is supposed to make in their lifetime. Redding said she does not want her belief in two religions to diminish the value she holds for both Christianity and Islam. Each faith by itself is enough to fulfill a person spiritually, she said. \"It's all there. I am not saying you have to go somewhere else to be complete. Some people don't need glasses, some people need single lenses. I need bifocals.\"",

    "input": "Rustenburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Dozens of South African miners defied orders to work Friday after a deadline arrived for management to respond to their list of grievances. About 100 workers at Anglo American Platinum in Rustenburg refused to work and demanded that the company address the list submitted a week ago. The miners resumed work after management held talks with six people selected to represent the workers, the company said in a statement. The two sides plan to continue working on a resolution. What's behind the Marikana massacre? \"We are pleased that the meeting ended on a positive note and would like to applaud our employees for acting in a manner that assured their safety and that of their colleagues,\" the company said in a statement. It did not say whether the talks yielded any results. The incident marks the latest labor discontent in the nation's mining heartland in the northwest. South Africans held memorial services nationwide Thursday for victims of clashes at the Lonmin Marikana mine. The strikes started as protests demanding higher wages, but escalated into one of the worst incidents of violence in post-apartheid South Africa. The clashes left 44 people dead, including 34 killed when police opened fire on charging protesters on August 16. An additional 10 people, including police officers, died in days leading up to that. A rivalry between two unions that wield a lot of power and influence in the nation added to the tension. The unions, accused of trying to outdo each other in negotiating wages, denied instigating the clashes. In addition to the two companies, there are signs of labor discontent at nearby Bafokeng Rasimone Platinum Mine. About 1,000 workers protested this week to voice their discontent over wages. They resumed work after a day. Fears of instability spread to other South African mines .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The father of Haleigh Cummings, a Florida girl who disappeared in February, plans to file for divorce from the girl's stepmother, a key witness in the case, his attorneys told HLN's \"Nancy Grace.\" Ronald Cummings plans to divorce his wife, Misty, his attorney says. The move follows weeks of reported tension between Ronald and Misty Cummings during the search for Haleigh, who was 5 when last seen. In papers expected to be filed Tuesday, Ronald Cummings, 25, cites irreconcilable differences in ending his short marriage to his 17-year-old wife, said Terry Shoemaker, Ronald Cummings' attorney. Haleigh went missing from her father's home in Satsuma, Florida, on February 9. Cummings has made several public pleas for information in her disappearance. Misty Cummings, then known as Misty Croslin, was the last person known to have seen Haleigh the night she disappeared from the family's rented mobile home. The teenager said she tucked Haleigh and her 4-year-old brother into bed about 8 p.m. and went to sleep herself two hours later, but awoke at 3 a.m. to find the girl missing and a cinder block propping open a back door. Ronald Cummings called police and reported his daughter missing when he returned from work at dawn. Investigators have said they do not feel Misty Cummings has told them everything she knows. \"The police have been telling me that I've been keeping Misty under my wing and that's why she hasn't talked to the cops,\" Ronald Cummings told a \"Nancy Grace\" producer Tuesday. \"So now, here you go, I divorced her. So now go find my baby.\"  Watch Ronald Cummings speak to Nancy Grace Â» . The Putnam County Sheriff's office said in August that \"the evidence and investigatory effort has minimized the likelihood that Haleigh's disappearance is the work of a stranger.\" Ronald Cummings and Crystal Sheffield, Haleigh's mother, are not considered suspects, police said. \"Investigators believe that Misty Croslin-Cummings continues to hold important answers in the case,\" the sheriff's office said in a written statement. \"She has failed to provide any sort of detailed accounting of the hours during the late evening and early morning of Haleigh's disappearance. Furthermore, physical evidence at the scene contradicts Misty's sketchy account of her evening activities.\" Shoemaker said his client told Misty Cummings he wanted a divorce on Sunday, and that the a divorce agreement was drawn up Monday. The agreement was sent to Misty Cummings' lawyer for her signature. \"He really didn't come to us and say, 'I want to file for divorce,'\" said another of Ronald Cummings' attorneys, Brandon Beardsley. \"My understanding is that this is something that he and Misty have been discussing for the last few days and they're contemplating it because they ultimately feel that it is in the best interest for both of them.\" Misty Cummings' attorney, Robert Fields, told CNN he has not talked with his client and doesn't know her thoughts regarding the divorce. Fields said he had received the papers via e-mail but had not had a chance to review them. Asked what he thought the divorce would mean for the search for Haleigh, he said, \"Probably nothing.\" \"You have to understand that ever since Haleigh went missing, they have been scrutinized,\" Beardsley said of the Cummingses. \"They can't go out to dinner, can't even go to the convenience store to get a drink. ... The pressure of everything that is going on, the allegations and speculation, has been a stress on the relationship. The two lived together for about six months before marrying in March. The divorce agreement provides no financial terms, according to Shoemaker. On Monday, Misty Cummings left Satsuma to stay with a friend in Orlando, 50 miles south, Shoemaker said.",

Vincent Windell, 22, and another man whose name was not released were in custody in connection with Thursday's shooting, Jeffersonville, Indiana, Chief Detective Charlie Thompson told CNN.

    "input": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Previously unseen footage of Diana, Princess of Wales, taken just hours before she was killed in a car crash, has been shown to the jury at the inquest into her death. The footage showed Diana and Dodi step into an elevator at the Ritz Hotel. Images taken from a security camera at the Ritz Hotel in Paris show the 36-year-old smiling as she and her lover Dodi Fayed step into an elevator and later walk out of the hotel. Further footage shows Fayed visiting a jeweler's shop, images that could lend support to claims that he was buying an engagement ring. Earlier, a British coroner at the inquest said tt may never be known for certain whether Princess Diana was pregnant when she died in the Paris car crash. Lord Justice Scott Baker told the jury at the inquest into the deaths of the princess and her lover Dodi Fayed that scientific evidence might be unable to demonstrate \"one way or the other\" whether she was in the early stages of pregnancy. But he said they would hear \"intimate\" details of her personal life.  Watch footage of Diana's last hours Â» . Baker told the 11 members of the jury -- six women and five men -- Diana may have been on the contraceptive pill and that evidence she was poised to get engaged to Dodi on the night she died was contradictory. On Tuesday the judge, who is acting as coroner in the case, told the jury that a famous image taken in summer 1997 showing Diana wearing a swimsuit could not be proof she was pregnant with Dodi's child as she had not started a relationship with him at that stage. The jury is set to hear \"scene setting\" evidence, including CCTV and a tourist video. The inquest to establish cause of death is expected to be a six-month process. Fayed's father, Mohammed Al Fayed, has contended from the start that Diana and his son were murdered because the royal family \"could not accept that an Egyptian Muslim could eventually be step-father to the future king of England,\" referring to Diana's son Prince William. \"I'm hoping for justice,\" Al Fayed said outside court. \"At last, we're going to have a jury from ordinary people and I hope to reach the decision which I believe that my son and Princess Diana have been murdered by the royal family.\" Baker told the jury of Al Fayed's allegations, but again reminded them that they were responsible for deciding the facts of the case, but not to assign blame or guilt. \"You have to decide four important, but limited factual questions: who the deceased were, when they came by their deaths, where they came by their deaths and how they came by their deaths,\" Baker said, according to inquest transcripts. \"The first three questions are unlikely to give rise to any difficulty. The fourth is a rather wider question and is directed towards the means by which they died.\" Diana, 36, and 42-year-old Dodi Fayed were killed on August 31, 1997 when the Mercedes-Benz they were traveling in hit a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma tunnel in Paris. They were being pursued at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the Ritz Hotel. Driver Henri Paul, who was also killed, was drunk and driving at high speed. Bodyguard Trevor Rees-Jones was the sole survivor. Next week, the jury is scheduled to travel to Paris to see the crash site, along the River Seine. They are also expected to hear testimony from the paparazzi who were present after the accident. In its evidence section, the Web site for the inquest has posted previously unpublished pictures taken by paparazzi of the limo before and immediately after the accident. One is a closeup -- looking into the front of the vehicle -- that shows Diana, Fayed, Paul and Rees-Jones minutes before the crash. E-mail to a friend .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- If you didn't know that Perry Farrell, Dave Navarro and Stephen Perkins were members of Jane's Addiction, you might think they belonged to three different bands -- and Farrell is the first to admit it. \"One guy's just a ball of sunshine. That's Stephen,\" the singer said. \"Then Dave is like a black hole sometimes, like places where he goes. And me? I'm just like a pingpong ball put in the cosmos, man.\" And that, ladies and gentlemen, pretty much sums up the genius of Jane's Addiction -- the friction of three disparate parts rubbing together, until finally, it explodes into a glorious musical fireball. It's a chemical reaction that, throughout the band's 26-year-history, has all too often imploded as well. \"I'm not really sure how many times we've parted ways,\" said Navarro, the group's guitarist. \"I wasn't really one of the people who thought we wouldn't be back together, primarily because we've gotten back together so many times over the years. We don't break up anymore. We just go on five-year hiatuses.\" The alternative rock pioneers are prepping the October 18 release of \"The Great Escape Artist,\" their first studio album in eight years. \"The sound is definitely updated on this album,\" Farrell said. \"The differences are that we are now working with synthesizers and computer software that goes with guitars, so you'll hear a lot of very modern sounds mixed in with what people call the ageless, or timeless, sound of Jane's Addiction.\" With original bassist Eric Avery, Jane's Addiction put a soundtrack to the gritty Southern California underground arts scene of the late 1980s. The group's first studio album, \"Nothing's Shocking,\" was an examination of love, lust, violence and drugs. By 1990, the band was all over rock radio with \"Stop!\" and \"Been Caught Stealing,\" a pair of hit singles off its sophomore disc, \"Ritual de lo Habitual.\" The new CD is only the group's fourth studio album. \"We pull from the environment,\" said drummer Perkins. \"Jane's Addiction wrote our (first) music in Hollywood in 1986. You hear Los Angeles. You hear that Mexico is only 100 miles away from us. You can hear the struggle, and also the glory, of being a musician in L.A. Our music was never negative, but it had that strong urge. You wanted to go f**k, not to go punch. And I think Jane's still has that.\" CNN visited the band during a video shoot for the new single, \"Irresistible Force,\" on a Hollywood soundstage. Farrell, the lyricist, said the song chronicles how the universe was created. \"I say the big bang was actually a conscious act of cosmic lovemaking.\" Perkins, the pragmatist, has a different interpretation. \"To me, the 'Irresistible Force' is what pulls me, Dave and Perry together. Ever since I was 13, I've been playing with Navarro. I met Perry when I was 17. And no matter how much we stopped playing with each other, and tried to get away from each other, it's the magnet -- it pulls us closer.\" The band members discussed their reunion and new album and how they've avoid fistfights for nearly two decades: . CNN: How does it feel to have Jane's Addiction back together again? Perry Farrell: I love performing with Jane's Addiction. I hope I get to do it all my life. It's healthy for bands to take a break every now and then. People are really looking forward to this new record because they're a little starved. I'm pulling the old woman's trick of making them want, and want, and need and desire. CNN: Who's the peacemaker who calls and says, \"Let's try this again?\" Dave Navarro: I don't really know how it happens. I'm all about peace, but it's like with any family. If there's a conflict in a family, and it's Thanksgiving, and everybody gets together, and you have a few drinks and you start chatting with the family member that you have a problem with -- next thing you know, it's all water under the bridge. Stephen Perkins: If we're not getting along, we don't just stay together because we're getting paid for it. But when we like each other, the music sounds better, and it feels better to cash those checks when you're doing it with friends. Navarro: The old stuff percolates, of course, but the tools we have as adults are different to handle it, you know what I mean? When you're younger, you're not as equipped -- or at least we weren't equipped -- to handle diverse personalities. What seemed a big deal at 19 is way less of a big deal in your 40s. CNN: So no awesome fistfights lately? Navarro: No, no. People keep asking about that. That was done in like '91. That was done a long time ago, and I don't even have any recollection of that. CNN: Maybe that was part of the problem. Navarro: That probably contributed to the problem. (Chuckles) CNN: Do you think you'd still be making music if you had continued to live the way you were living? Navarro: Well, I can't speak for anybody else about that, but I certainly feel that any day above ground is a blessing. Been through a lot. CNN: How do you think you guys would have held up through the scrutiny that's part of today's culture? Navarro: When Jane's Addiction got started, it was the '80s, and there weren't cell phones, and there weren't people chasing people down the street with cameras, and there wasn't the Internet, and there wasn't cable news the way it is now. And I don't know if we'd be where we are, quite frankly, if there was, because we had some what I'd like to call 'colorful times.' You know, the less widely reported, the better. CNN: In order to generate press sometimes, you can't be just a musician. You have to be a musician/celebrity. Navarro: I didn't write the book, but I read the book that earlier had been written by Tommy Lee. CNN: Are people meaner now? Navarro: Back in the old days, there was no \"commenting\" section. Whatever comments you had were up here (points to his head), or you told your friend. It wasn't like public fodder. So yeah, people are meaner now. Sure. But you've got to take the attitude of, \"OK, we're in a blessed position.\" You can't ask the world to entirely love you. CNN: The story of Jane's Addiction is very rock 'n' roll.

    "input": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- A plea deal has been reached in the assault case against singer Chris Brown, defense attorney Mark Geragos said in a hearing Monday. Chris Brown, at court Monday, will serve five years probation and must do jail time or community service. Brown, 20, faced charges of assaulting his pop star girlfriend, Rihanna, following a row earlier this year. Under terms of the agreement, Brown will serve five years of probation and must serve 180 days in jail or the equivalent -- about 1,400 hours -- in \"labor-oriented service,\" said Sandi Gibbons, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office. He must also undergo a year-long domestic-violence counseling class, she said. Brown's sentence is comparable to other felony sentences when the defendant has no previous record, she said. \"This is not an easy sentence,\" Gibbons said. He must check in with a probation officer every three months. Brown had previously pleaded not guilty to felony counts of assault and making criminal threats in connection with an attack on Rihanna. But under the plea deal, he pleaded guilty to one count of assault with the intent of doing great bodily injury in connection with the argument inside a rented Lamborghini on a Hollywood street in February.  See a timeline of events in this case Â» . Rihanna, whose real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, made a brief appearance at the hearing -- after Brown had left the courtroom -- to hear Los Angeles Criminal Court Judge Patricia Schnegg discuss the issuance of a \"stay away\" order requiring him to stay 100 yards from her. Through her attorney, Rihanna had requested that such an order not be issued. But Schnegg refused that request, saying she would issue such an order but would revise it to 50 yards -- 10 yards if the two are at the same \"industry event\" together. Schnegg told Rihanna, who was wearing a black dress with white pearls around her neck, that she would consider lifting the order after Brown completes his domestic violence counseling but advised Rihanna not to contact Brown. Asked whether she understood, Rihanna said she did before leaving the courtroom via a back door. Rihanna's attorney, Donald Etra, said Rihanna made the request because she felt that a protective order in place, requiring that Brown not annoy or harass her, was sufficient. Schnegg said Brown could apply to have his supervised probation transferred to Virginia, where he maintains his legal residence. He also can complete his community service there, she said, but it would have to meet the court's standards. \"I want Mr. Brown treated as any other defendant who comes to this court,\" Schnegg said. She noted, however, that he has no prior criminal record. Gibbons, of the district attorney's office, explained that the judge wants Brown to work -- remove graffiti, for instance -- as part of his service. \"His sentence is not based on what he's available to do,\" Gibbons said. \"His sentence is what he's going to do, or he's going to go to state prison for four years.\" Dressed in a light plaid suit, Brown answered \"guilty\" when asked his plea by Assistant District Attorney Mary Murray. Formal sentencing was set for August 5. After the hearing, Geragos said of Brown, \"as long as I've known him in connection with this case, he's wanted to take responsibility.\" He said Brown is thankful to those who offered him support and noted that he is \"a kid who's never been in trouble before\" who wants to \"move past this\" and get out the message that domestic violence is not acceptable. Brown \"embraces this as an opportunity to get his life back on track and get his career back on track,\" Geragos said, adding that Brown will speak further after his sentencing. Etra said after the hearing that Rihanna \"was fully prepared to testify and she would have told the truth about what happened that evening.\" He said she did not object to the plea agreement. Rihanna had not attended any of the hearings in the case but had been following the case closely, Etra said earlier. She did not file a complaint against Brown, but the prosecution's case was built on what she told detectives and on physical evidence collected from her, including photographs of her bruised and battered face. It was not Rihanna who called police but someone who heard her screams for help, according to a sworn statement by Los Angeles Police Detective DeShon Andrews. The statement, filed with the court to support a search warrant for cell phone records, described a brutal attack against Rihanna, allegedly by Brown. Andrews said the incident began when Rihanna, who was riding in the sports car driven by Brown, found a text message on his cell phone from \"a woman who Brown had a previous sexual relationship with.\" \"A verbal argument ensued,\" followed by the physical attack, the statement said. It went on to describe the assault in great detail, saying Brown punched her numerous times and put her in a head lock, restricting her breathing and causing her to start to lose consciousness. He threatened to \"beat the s--t out of you\" and kill her, according to the statement, and also bit her ear and her fingers. Eventually, \"Robyn F. began screaming for help and Brown exited the vehicle and walked away. A resident in the neighborhood heard Robyn F.'s plea for help and called 911, causing a police response. An investigation was conducted and Robyn F. was issued a Domestic Violence Emergency Protective Order.\" At the end of his statement, the detective said Brown sent a text message nine days later, apologizing. Brown also issued a public apology for the incident just days after his arrest. \"Words cannot begin to express how sorry and saddened I am over what transpired,\" he said in a statement released by his spokesman. \"I am seeking the counseling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person.\" CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this story.",

In a joint statement, MGM Studios and Dahlia Waingort, the producer of the film originally known as Raging Bull II, declared on Wednesday that Waingort's film now has the working title The Bronx Bull, and is in no way associated with Martin Scorsese's 1980 film Raging Bull. The announcement resolves a lawsuit brought by MGM in July that attempted to shut down production on the film, which traces the life of boxer Jake LaMotta in the years that span before and after Raging Bull. LaMotta, now 91 years old, has been cooperating with that project, but it otherwise had nothing to do with Scorsese's film, which won star Robert De Niro an Academy Award. Instead, Boardwalk Empire's William Forsythe is playing the older LaMotta, with Mojean Aria playing him as a youth. Check out the full statement below: . The parties have amicably reached a resolution of their pending litigation, pursuant to which production of a film based upon certain events in the life of Jake LaMotta will proceed under the working title The Bronx Bull.

    "input": "(CNN) -- The comedian Rodney Dangerfield used to complain, \"I don't get no respect.\" Sometimes, it feels like those words ought to be printed on the presidential seal. Last week, Barack Obama was interrupted by Daily Caller journalist Neil Munro while making a statement on immigration. Munro shouted questions at him until the president was forced to stop and demand silence. Many media outlets, particularly those with a liberal bent, were outraged. The UK Guardian called it \"a breach of etiquette so severe it managed to shock even the notoriously unfastidious journalistic profession.\" An MSNBC panel acknowledged that news conferences under Clinton and Bush could get awkward, but concluded that Obama gets even rougher treatment because of the color of his skin. The fact that Munro was shouting questions about immigration only added to the impression that the president's conservative persecutors are motivated by race. The problem is that this theory only holds up if Obama is being treated with a historically unique degree of hostility. He's not. Relations between presidents and press have always been fraught. President Theodore Roosevelt was the first POTUS to try to cultivate journalists: He assigned them a room in the White House. But journalists who put out reports without Teddy's consent (so-called \"Muckrakers\") were cut out of the loop, denied access to any federal department. Incidentally, Roosevelt's relations with ordinary voters were just as prickly. In 1912, he was shot while giving a speech on the campaign trail. With admirable sangfroid, Teddy calculated from the lack of blood that the bullet had not penetrated any organs and finished his oration, before being rushed to the nearest hospital. It puts Obama being told \"You lie!\" into perspective. Opinion: What's behind dissing of the president? It was Woodrow Wilson who started the formal press conference, and quickly regretted it. When reporters printed romantic rumors about his daughter, Margaret, Wilson harangued the press corps. \"This must stop!\" he shouted. \"On the next offense, I shall do what any other indignant father would do. I will punch the man who prints it on the nose.\" Franklin D. Roosevelt turned the press conference into the question and answer session we know today and mastered it. But poor Dwight Eisenhower, who was used to getting 100% respect as a soldier, found the experience as a citizen rather trying. At his first conference after he had declared his candidacy for the presidency in 1952, he was shocked when, in the middle of a speech about the defenses of Europe, a journalist interrupted to ask, \"What's the matter with your eye?\" The general explained that he had an infection. At a later date, he was asked his opinion of his rival Robert Taft and said, \"He's a goddam isolationist.\" Eisenhower was genuinely surprised when the remark was printed. Things only got worse in the 1970s, when Richard Nixon's combative approach to the press turned Watergate-era press conferences into a battleground. At a press conference on October 26, 1973, Nixon complained, \"I have never seen or heard such outrageous, vicious, gutter reporting in 27 years of public life.\" Addressing one reporter, he added, \"Yet, don't get the impression that you rouse my anger. You see, one can only be angry with those he respects.\" Watergate changed everything: After that, presidents would shield themselves from the press and try to manage their public appearances better. This wiped clean the popular memory of fiery exchanges, interruptions and acid put downs that had defined the previous century. A new dynamic occurred, whereby there would be long periods of managed relations between press and president that gave the false impression of obeyed protocol and mutual respect. But then, in the midst of a crisis, all the bottled-up emotions would get released at once. For example, while Lyndon Johnson held 135 solitary press conferences during his time in office, Ronald Reagan held only 46. The result was that when Reagan did take questions, the journalists often let him have it. The most notorious occasion was November 25, 1986, when Reagan held a press conference with Attorney General Ed Meese to discuss the Iran-Contra scandal. The president was interrupted by several reporters in the room Ã¢â¬â and reporters were still shouting questions as he walked away from the microphone. A large part of Obama's problem is that he has followed the Reagan example -- testing the patience of the press by prioritizing stage managed events (he gave 408 interviews in his first three years, compared with George W. Bush's 136) over question and answer sessions. According to political science professor Martha Kumar, Obama has held fewer press conferences for the White House press corps (17) than Bill Clinton (31), George H.W. Bush (56), and even Ronald Reagan (21) in the first three years. (George W. Bush, however, held only 11). Indeed, it's notable that after his confrontation with Neil Munro, Obama did not take questions. He was there to make a statement Ã¢â¬â it was not a news conference -- and it is understandable that some in the press might find that frustrating. The bigger, more sensitive issue is the degree to which liberal supporters of the president are conflating disrespect and racism -- and so actually poisoning the political atmosphere even further. Munro's interruption was rude and he deserved all the criticism he got. But times are tough in America right now and when things get rough, people inevitably turn on their leaders. Obama's announcement that the administration would grant effective amnesty to 800,000 children of illegal immigrants was bound to provoke an impassioned response. A classier person than Munro might have found a better way to voice anxieties. But invoking \"racism\" as the only way to understand the righteous fury of the right sounds like an attempt to gag the opposition. The fact is that Obama is a controversial president during a difficult time in American history. It's surprising that he hasn't been interrupted more rudely and more often. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Timothy Stanley.",

    "input": "ALGIERS, Algeria (CNN) -- Rescuers are sifting through the rubble of the United Nations headquarters in Algiers hoping to find survivors after a powerful bomb ripped off the building's facade and leveled nearby U.N. offices. Rescuers and bomb experts search for survivors in the rubble of a destroyed building. It was one of two suspected car bombs that struck Algiers within 10 minutes of each other. The death toll is unclear: the official government count is at least 26, but hospital sources in Algiers told CNN affiliate BFM-TV that 76 people were killed in the two blasts. A statement from the United Nations said 45 people were reported killed. Algerian Interior Minister Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni blamed a militant Islamic group with ties to al Qaeda for the attacks, which also targeted a building housing Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court. In a posting on an Islamist Web site, the group al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb claimed responsibility. CNN could not immediately corroborate that claim, but the Web site is known to carry messages, claims and videos from al Qaeda and other militant groups. In the posting, the bombers were identified as Sheikh Ibrahim Abu Othman and Abdel Rahman Abu Abdel Nasser al-Asimi. It said two trucks were filled with \"no less than 800 kg (1,763 pounds) of explosives.\" The group called the operation \"another successful conquest and a second epic that the knights of faith have dictated with their blood, defending the wounded Islamic nation and in defiance to the Crusaders and their agents, the slaves of America and the sons of France.\" At least 10 U.N. staffers were among those killed, according to U.N. spokeswoman Marie Okabe. The offices of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees -- located across the street from the U.N. headquarters -- were leveled by a blast that struck about 9:30 a.m. (3:30 a.m. ET) Tuesday. \"Our offices are basically destroyed now, nothing works,\" UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said from its Geneva headquarters. Watch his full interview . He said rescuers are working into the night trying to get to the trapped U.N. workers. \"It's a very serious situation still with the U.N. in Algiers,\" he said. In a strongly worded statement, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what he called \"an abjectly cowardly strike against civilian officials serving humanity's highest ideals under the U.N. banner.\" \"The perpetrators of these crimes will not escape the strongest possible condemnation -- and ultimate punishment -- by Algerian authorities and the international community,\" Ban said in the written statement. He said he has sent senior advisers and other top U.N. officials to head to Algiers to assist in the investigation and rescue effort. Most of those killed in the coordinated attacks were victims of the first suspected car bombing near the Constitutional Council -- which oversees elections -- and Supreme Court in the Algiers neighborhood of Ben Aknoun, according to the state-run Algeria Press Agency. That blast struck a bus outside the targeted building, killing many of those on board, the news agency reported. One man said he heard the first blast then the second exploded in front of him. \"I saw the trees falling and the glass shattering in front of me. I had to run away from the car,\" he said. Zerhouni said the attack was the work of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC), the same group that took responsibility for an attack in April in downtown Algiers that killed 33 people. That group also uses the name al Qaeda Islamic Maghreb after merging with al Qaeda earlier this year. It abandoned small-scale attacks in favor of headline-grabbing blasts after it joined with al Qaeda. CNN International Security Correspondent Paula Newton said the merger combined the expertise of Algerian guerrillas with the operational ability of al Qaeda in North Africa, enabling the group to penetrate the usually extensive security in high-profile areas of Algiers. She said the group's goal is to destabilize countries like Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia, which it sees as enemies of the Islamic state. Zerhouni said police interrogations of GSPC members arrested in the wake of the April attack revealed that Algeria's Constitutional Council and Supreme Court were on a list of GSPC targets. Algeria, which has a population of 33 million, is still recovering from more than a decade of violence that began after the military government called a halt to elections which an Islamist party was poised to win. Tens of thousands of people died in the unrest. Although the country has remained relatively peaceful, recent terrorist attacks have raised fears of a slide back to violence. E-mail to a friend .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Myanmar opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi is expected to meet Tuesday with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, a day after she said she would take the oath of office for the country's parliament after initially resisting it. The impasse over the oath had been preventing her and other newly elected members of her party from taking their seats in the legislature. \"I will go to the parliament because there is a demand of people who voted for me,\" Suu Kyi said after meeting with party members in Yangon on Monday. She and 42 other members of her party, the National League for Democracy, were elected in by-elections earlier this month. They had been delaying their debuts in parliament because they objected to the wording of the oath they would have to take. The NLD had asked the authorities to amend the oath to say that members will \"abide by\" the constitution rather than \"protect\" it. Party members want to revise the constitution, which they view as undemocratic. But the government of President Thein Sein, a former military official, didn't appear to show any sign of moving to accommodate the request. Suu Kyi, who spent years under house arrest, said Monday that she would \"take an oath for the country and for the people.\" She added that she had been urged to enter parliament by some parliament members and representatives of Myanmar's ethnic minority groups. Asked whether she was concerned she may appear weak by backing down over the oath, Suu Kyi said, \"I don't care.\" Nyan Win, a spokesman for the NLD, said Suu Kyi will attend parliament in the capital, Naypyidaw, on Wednesday for \"just one day.\" The breakthrough came while the U.N. chief Ban was in Myanmar. He met with top officials, including Thein Sein, on Monday and offered U.N. support. He is scheduled to meet Tuesday with Suu-Kyi. The international organization is available to provide technical assistance for Myanmar's first census in 2014 and lend its electoral expertise in the run-up to the 2015 elections, the United Nations said. Ban is the latest in a string of high-profile officials to visit the country as it emerges from decades of international isolation. Myanmar's authoritarian military rulers are loosening their grip on power after decades of stifling dissent and limiting freedoms. In the past 12 months, the government has pardoned hundreds of political prisoners, secured a cease-fire with Karen rebels and agreed to negotiate with other ethnic rebel groups. The success of Suu Kyi and her party at the by-elections this month was welcomed by the United States and European Union as a sign of progress toward democracy. The dispute over the wording of the oath appeared to create an early stumbling block in that process. But Suu Kyi said last week that she did not want the issue to become \"political,\" insisting that it was a \"technical\" problem. Her arrival in parliament on Wednesday will illustrate the pace at which Myanmar is changing: She was released from house arrest less than a year and a half ago. Control of parliament will not change despite the opposition's strong performance, but the entry of the NLD members will nonetheless give the party a notable presence. Myanmar's legislature has 664 seats, more than 80% of which are still held by lawmakers aligned with the military-backed ruling group, the Union Solidarity and Development Party. Many Western governments have taken steps to ease sanctions on Myanmar, also known as Burma, in response to its political reforms. But international officials have also cautioned that the country still has a long way to go. Speaking last week ahead of his trip, the United Nations' Ban said that Myanmar's \"fresh start is still fragile.\"",

The indictment charges Portillo with embezzling tens of millions of dollars in public funds, \"a portion of which he then laundered through bank accounts located, among other places, in the United States and Europe,\" the indictment says. A grand jury indicted Portillo in U.S. District Court in New York. Portillo engineered an embezzlement with co-conspirators that occurred from about 2000 through about 2003, the indictment says. Prosecutors allege the money-laundering took place through at least 2006. Portillo was the president of Guatemala from 2000 to 2004. Authorities in Guatemala started searching for him after the United States requested his extradition, a spokesman for the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala told CNN en EspaÃ±ol on Sunday. They executed search warrants in four locations but had not found him as of Sunday night, officials said. Portillo came into power promising to clean up corruption, but found his own government mired in the same accusations as his predecessors. According to the indictment, in one instance in 2000, Portillo funneled $1.5 million worth of donations for a literacy project from Taiwan into accounts in Europe controlled by his ex-wife and daughter. In that case, the indictment alleges, Portillo endorsed three $500,000 checks destined for a program to purchase books for libraries, but diverted the funds into a bank in Miami, Florida. That money was eventually laundered into his family's accounts in Europe, the court document states. In short, \"this money was diverted, in a series of transactions and transfers designed to conceal the sources and origin of the funds,\" the indictment states. There was a second instance where Portillo allegedly embezzled money given to Guatemala by the Taiwanese, according to the document. In addition, Portillo is accused of embezzling money from his defense ministry in 2001. With the help of others, Portillo made large cash transactions that ended up in accounts belonging to him and his co-conspirators, the document says. Some of the money that Portillo took went to buy expensive watches and cars, the indictment says.",

Tutu celebrated Thursday by dancing with the Soweto Gospel Choir during a church celebration to mark his birthday. Music and laughter rang out in the cathedral during the event attended by Irish rocker Bono of U2. The Dalai Lama had hoped to deliver birthday greetings personally but scrapped his planned visit after South Africa failed to issue him a visa in time. Instead, the Tibetan spiritual leader wished Tutu well in a webcast. \"Please take care,\" the Dalai Lama said. \"I will pray both to god as well as Buddha for your long life and healthy body.\" \"I am quite sad,\" he said. \"And also this time, I was very much hoping to see Nelson Mandela, (who is) now very old. Now I have doubt whether I will have the occasion to meet Nelson Mandela or not.\" Mandela turned 93 this year. Tutu lashed out at his government Tuesday, saying it had forgotten what the nation stood for. \"When we used to apply for passports under the apartheid government, we never knew until the last moment what their decision was,\" Tutu said at a news conference. \"Our government is worse than the apartheid government because at least you were expecting it from the apartheid government. The Dalai Lama had been invited to the country to receive a peace award and speak at various events, including a lecture in honor of Tutu's birthday. Tutu and the Dalai Lama are recipients of the Nobel Peace Prize. South Africa denies the visa was linked to pressure from China, a major trade partner. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed uprising against Chinese rule, and the nation pressures governments worldwide to deny him any legitimacy. Despite the setback, tributes came in early Friday for the man known fondly as \"the people's priest\" and hailed for his fight for human rights. In a birthday message, the U.S. Embassy in South Africa said he \"continues to provide a moral voice for the voiceless.\" \"We congratulate Archbishop Desmond Tutu ... and join South Africa and the global community in honoring a man who is recognized for his fearlessness in speaking truth to power,\" the embassy in Pretoria said in a statement. \"From his work against apartheid in South Africa, to his championing of democracy, freedom and human rights, and advocacy for those still living under the scourge of homophobia, racism or xenophobia, Archbishop Tutu has served as the vocal conscience of a generation.\" This is not the first time the Dalai Lama has not been able to visit South Africa. Two years ago, South Africa refused the Tibetan spiritual leader a visa to attend an international peace conference, saying it was not in the country's interest for him to attend.

Teachers and doctors in Buenos Aires went on strike Wednesday and are scheduled to go back to work Friday, the government-run Telam news agency and other outlets reported. Subway workers will go on strike Thursday night for a few hours, they said. This is the fourth work stoppage in the past six months for doctors. Only emergency cases are being treated. The doctors are not only seeking better salaries, but also improvements to the public health system. They are protesting \"the lack of money in the public system, the possibility that the health budget will be reduced by 500 million pesos (about $130 million), the lack of professionals, the lack of labor to solve the problems in Argentina's public health,\" said Alicia Kobylarz of the Federal Syndicate of Health Workers.

The hospitals depend on funding from the provinces, leading to major differences in each area's needs and what local health care facilities can offer. \"Provinces that have petroleum income, for example, are provinces that have better budgets, that have better hospitals\" said Aldo Neri, a former national health minister. \"There is much inequality in the treatment that the poor receive in Argentinean public hospitals depending on which province they live in. That's why I say the inequalities have increased.\" The current health minister, Juan Manzur, said next year's health budget will have an increase of more than 15 percent, greater than the national budget, which will have a 12.4 percent increase. Teachers also want greater pay and announced Thursday they would go back on strike Tuesday because of failed talks with Buenos Aires Education Director Mario Oporto. The teachers say they want their raises by year's end. Oporto said there's no money for raises now, the official Telam news agency reported. \"The province's posture is very clear: There won't be raises in 2009 because there already have been,\" Oporto told a radio station, according to Telam. \"We're sorry about the work stoppage, and we are ready to keep working. This time we are very firm: There will be no raises in 2009.\" Daniel Scioli, governor of Buenos Aires Province, said public education \"is our top priority\" but also emphasized there would be no raises this year, the news agency reported. Teachers' union leaders complained Thursday that government officials went to schools Wednesday to find out which teachers were there and which had joined the work stoppage, Telam said. Subway workers in Buenos Aires announced they will walk off the job at 7 p.m. Thursday. They, too, want pay raises. Educators also are on strike in neighboring Chile, where professors say they are owed a \"historic debt.\" The indefinite strike entered its fourth day Thursday and negotiations are scheduled to resume Friday. Jaime Gajardo, president of Chile's College of Professors, told a local TV station there has been improvement in negotiations with the government and the talks could advance noticeably in the next few days. Pablo Zalaquett, the mayor of Santiago, the capital of Chile, said the two sides are closer on a pay bonus the professors want. CNN's Javier Doberti contributed to this report.",

    "input": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- A Georgia judge threw the book at Brian Nichols on Saturday, giving him four consecutive sentences of life without parole for a 2005 shooting rampage that started in an Atlanta courthouse. Brian Nichols tells the court Saturday in Atlanta, Georgia, \"I will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life.\" \"I'm giving you the maximum -- every day I could give you. If I could give you more, I would,\" Superior Court Judge James Bodiford told Nichols. Nichols, 37, was convicted last month of 54 counts for a deadly shooting rampage that began March 11, 2005, in the same courthouse where he stood trial. Nichols, who was being tried for rape, shot three people to death as he escaped from the downtown courthouse that day and a federal agent the next day in Atlanta's Buckhead district before being captured in neighboring Gwinnett County. \"I know that the things that I've done caused a lot of pain, and I am sorry,\" Nichols, who remained seated, told the court before sentence was pronounced. \"And I just wanted to say that I will not bring dishonor to the decision to spare my life.\"  Watch victims' family members react to the sentence Â» . Nichols was spared a death sentence Friday after the jury deliberating his fate announced that it could not agree on a sentence. Bodiford gave Nichols the maximum sentence on all the non-murder charges, and ordered them to be served consecutively. Those terms ranged from five years for escape to life for armed robbery. Other charges included aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, robbery by force, theft by taking, hijacking a motor vehicle and false imprisonment. \"It's a large number of years. It's many lifetimes,\" Bodiford said. Bodiford ordered that Nichols serve his time in the Georgia state penal system, forgoing the possibility of sending him to the federal maximum-security prison in Colorado. Bodiford implored Nichols' family and attorneys never to trust Nichols again. \"There's ample evidence that trusting him will get you killed,\" he said in concluding the sentencing hearing. Jurors told Bodiford on Friday night that they were deadlocked, with nine in favor of death and three in favor of life without parole. Under Georgia law, the jurors must reach a unanimous decision in order to impose a death sentence. In the absence of a unanimous jury verdict, the decision fell in the hands of Bodiford. Defense lawyers said Nichols, who confessed to the killings, suffers from a mental disorder. The jurors unanimously found the necessary aggravating circumstances in the four murders, but they were split over the death penalty. After nine weeks of testimony, the jury found Nichols guilty of 54 counts, which included the four murders plus numerous aggravated assaults, carjackings and kidnappings. The shootings began in the Fulton County Courthouse, where Nichols was set to stand trial for rape. He overpowered a sheriff's deputy and took her gun before proceeding to the courtroom of Judge Rowland Barnes, killing him and court reporter Julie Ann Brandau. Sgt. Hoyt Teasley chased Nichols to outside the courthouse, where Nichols fatally shot him. Nichols killed off-duty U.S. Customs Agent David Wilhelm as he worked on a house in Buckhead the next day. He was captured later that day after a standoff with police in the apartment of a woman he had taken hostage in Gwinnett County. The case drew nationwide attention, in part because of the cost of Nichols' representation: about $2 million at last accounting. Nichols had attempted to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, but the Fulton County District Attorney's Office would not take the death penalty off the table.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A Florida circuit judge Tuesday struck down a 31-year-old state law that prevents gays and lesbians from adopting children, allowing a North Miami man to adopt two half-brothers he and his partner have raised as foster children since 2004. Martin Gill looks on as a judge overturns a ban preventing gays and lesbians from adopting children. \"There is no question, the blanket exclusion of gay applicants defeats Florida's goal of providing dependent children a permanent family through adoption,\" Judge Cindy S. Lederman wrote in her 53-page ruling. \"The best interests of children are not preserved by prohibiting homosexual adoption.\" The state attorney general's office has appealed the decision. Lederman said there is no moral or scientific reason for banning gays and lesbians from adopting, despite the state's arguments otherwise. The state argued that gays and lesbians have higher odds of suffering from depression, affective and anxiety disorders and substance abuse, and that their households are more unstable. Lederman said the ban violated children's right to permanency provided under the Florida statute and under the federal Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997. Whether the ban violated the state's equal protection clause by singling out gays and lesbians should be considered, she said. Lederman's ruling paves the way for Martin Gill to legally adopt the two half-brothers, ages 4 and 8, whom he has cared for since December 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union said. The two boys, who are referred to as John and James Doe in court documents, were removed from their homes on allegations of abandonment and neglect. \"On that December evening, John and James left a world of chronic neglect, emotional impoverishment and deprivation to enter a new world, foreign to them, that was nurturing, safe, structured and stimulating,\" Lederman wrote. In 2006, the children's respective fathers' rights were terminated, court documents said, and they remained in the care of Gill and his partner. \"Our family just got a lot more to be thankful for this Thanksgiving,\" Gill said Tuesday, according to the ACLU, which represented him. Florida is the only state that specifically bans all \"homosexual\" people from adopting children, although it does allow them to be foster parents. This month, Arkansas voters approved a ballot measure to prohibit unmarried partners -- same-sex or opposite-sex couples -- from adopting children or from serving as foster parents. The measure is similar to one in Utah, which excludes same-sex couples indirectly through a statute barring all unmarried couples from adopting or taking in foster children. Mississippi allows single gays and lesbians to adopt, but prohibits same-sex couples from adopting. Neal Skene, spokesman for the Florida Department of Children and Families, said the appeal was filed so a statewide resolution on the law could be determined by an appellate court. He noted that another Florida circuit judge declared the law unconstitutional this year but that ruling had not been appealed. \"We need a statewide determination by the appellate courts,\" he said. Gill's adoption petition cannot be approved until the appeal process is finished, Skene said, but the children will remain in Gill's home. \"These are wonderful foster parents,\" Skene said. \"It's just that we have a statute, [and] the statute is very clear on the issue of adoption.\" Several organizations -- including the National Adoption Center, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics -- have said that having gay and lesbian parents does not negatively affect children. The Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute, a nonprofit organization that studies adoption and foster care, hailed the decision. \"This ban, which was the only one of its kind in the country, has done nothing but undermine the prospects of boys and girls in the foster care system to get permanent, loving homes,\" said Adam Pertman, the Adoption Institute's executive director, in a written statement. \"So this decision by Judge Lederman is a very important, hopeful ruling for children who need families.\"",

    "input": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia (CNN) -- When Canadian cocaine smuggler Charles Lai was being sentenced in a Seattle federal courtroom last month, the judge sending him to prison for 13 years offered a small item of good news. A suspected gang member in Vancouver is taken out of a bar in handcuffs. At least behind bars, Judge James Robart said, drug smuggler Lai would not become another fatality in Vancouver's gang wars. Authorities in Vancouver, just 30 miles from the border, are struggling to deal with the boom in the drug trade between the United States and Canada, along with the violence that has come with it. Cocaine from Mexico -- and many of the guns that fuel the violence -- come north via the United States. Canadian smugglers then bring south high-quality marijuana known as \"BC Bud\" and synthetic drugs like methamphetamine. A recent U.N. drug report named Canada as the \"primary\" supplier of Ecstasy to the United States. The gang killings are blamed in part over who will control which areas of this estimated $6 billion-a-year narcotics trade. Beyond the string of slayings and shootings that have taken place over the last two years are the new modes in which the violence is carried out. \"It's the type of murders, the more brazen public shootings, the shootings in front of the grocery store with automatic weapons,\" said superintendent Pat Fogarty of the Royal Mounted Police, who oversees a special multi-jurisdictional unit that is taking on the gangs and larger criminal organizations behind them. \"It's common now for gangsters to carry body armor and wear it, to have bulletproof cars,\" Fogarty said. \"What that does is when one gang is shooting up another gang, their .40-calibers aren't able to pierce the body armor of the vehicle or the body armor of the vests. So what we've seen is an elevation in firepower, which is a scary process.\"  Watch how authorities are fighting the gangs Â» . Some of the incidents have already become legend: the car radio repairman killed while fixing a gangster's stereo, thugs shooting up the parking garage of a mall with machine guns, the postal worker refusing to deliver mail to a street where a family with well-known gang ties live. The gangs -- police estimate there at least 120 different groups operating in Vancouver and the surrounding area -- have names like the UN, the Red Scorpions, the Big Circle Boys and the Independent Soldiers. They are mostly homegrown operations or recruits from immigrant communities. Some gang members come from middle-class families and join up expecting the Hollywood version of criminal life. \"These guys act like rock stars,\" said Sgt. Kieron McConnell of the British Columbia Integrated Gang Task Force. It's McConnell's job to remove what he calls \"the mystique of being a gangster.\" A 20-year police veteran with a looming frame and completely bald head, McConnell and the officers who patrol with him act as a buzzkill to many gang members' night on the town. The Gang Task Force slowly winds through bars and clubs known for their gangster clientele. Until closing time, the police check for identification and run names. Through an agreement with most of the bars in the city, when police find anyone with a history of violence or drug peddling, they can bounce them from the establishment -- no questions asked. The police's goal is not to harass the gang members, they say, but to remove a potential target from an area full of bystanders. \"We are encouraging them not to bring violence with them to where they socialize,\" McConnell said. Chris Mohan's son did not need to go far, however, to become an innocent victim of the gangs. The violence literally came to his doorstep. In October 2007, Mohan, 22 years old, was walking out of the apartment where he lived with his parents when gang hit men came to murder a neighbor police believe was involved in the drug trade. Mohan was one of six people killed in the shooting. \"They killed Chris, but I got a life sentence,\" Mohan's mother, Eileen Mohan, said of having to live without her son. Despite what they took from her, Eileen Mohan does not show any fear of the gangs. She has become an advocate for tougher sentencing of violent criminals, attends the hearings for the men accused of her son's killing and still lives in the apartment where he died. Her mission now is to hurt gangsters. \"They touched my life illegally, I want to touch theirs legally,\" she said. Even though police say they are taking the fight to the gangs like never before, it remains to be seen if authorities can totally dismantle Vancouver's gangs and the larger criminal organization behind them.  Watch how border agents look for smuggled drugs Â» . Police say they need legislation passed that would enable them to monitor encrypted cell phone conversations and for the legal system to pass down stiffer sentences on gangsters. Tougher sentences may explain why more Canadian drug traffickers like Charles Lai face a courtroom in America, not Canada. Even though Canadian authorities say they are capable of trying their own criminals, crime experts say police are sometimes all too happy if smugglers are captured in the United States, where they face a less bureaucratic justice system and longer stretches in jail. \"In these regional operations, the tendency has been for the offenders to be arrested, charged and processed in the United States, not Canada,\" said Robert Gordon, director of the School of Criminology at the Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. \"That's an indictment of how we are handling this.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Back in his native South Korea, the Korean Foreign Ministry nicknamed him \"Ban-chusa,\" meaning \"the Bureaucrat\" or \"the administrative clerk.\" U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has focused on global warming policy by world governments. While Ban Ki-moon was known for his attention to detail and administrative skill, he was also seen by some as lacking in charisma and subservient to his superiors, while the Korean press called him \"the slippery eel\" for his ability to dodge questions. But on October 13, 2006, South Korea's Foreign Minister Ban Ki-moon was elected to be the eighth Secretary-General by the United Nations General Assembly. Following up on a campaign aiming to bring out his charismatic side, Ban surprised the audience of a UN Correspondents' dinner that December by singing \"Ban Ki-moon is coming to town\" on the melody of \"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.\" Ban was born on 13 June 1944. He received a bachelor's degree in international relations from Seoul National University in 1970, and a master's degree in public administration from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in 1985. He and his wife, Yoo (Ban) Soon-taek, whom he met in high school in 1962, have one son and two daughters. In addition to Korean, Ban speaks fluent English and is studying French. Ban was the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea from January 2004 to November 2006. His tenure included postings in New Delhi, Washington D.C. and Vienna, while he was responsible for a variety of portfolios such as Foreign Policy Advisor to the President, Chief National Security Adviser to the President, Deputy Minister for Policy Planning and Director-General of American Affairs. Throughout this service, his guiding vision was that of a peaceful Korean peninsula, playing an expanding role for peace and prosperity in the region and the wider world. Ban had long been actively involved in issues relating to inter-Korean relations. In 1992, as Special Advisor to the Foreign Minister, he served as Vice Chair of the South-North Joint Nuclear Control Commission following the adoption of the historic Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. In September 2005, as Foreign Minister, he played a leading role in bringing about another landmark agreement aimed at promoting peace and stability on the Korean peninsula with the adoption at the Six Party Talks of the Joint Statement on resolving the North Korean nuclear issue. In January 2007 Ban succeeded Kofi Annan and has since pushed the Sudanese government to allow peacekeeping troops in Darfur and focused on global warming policy by world governments.",

    "input": "Thanks to the flu, a broken ankle, a staph infection, and bronchitis, plus several school cancellations, my three children were at home -- hurting, vomiting, coughing, or tracking muddy water into our house -- all but seven days last February. (Shall I pause to let the horror of that number sink in? All but seven.) I'm normally an efficient, organized person who thrives on plans and checklists, but by the end of that month, I'd accomplished almost nothing beyond reading aloud the entire fifth book of Harry Potter. I felt so anxious that I was on the verge of hyperventilation. Originally a form of self-defense, the ancient Chinese art of tai chi promotes serenity through gentle movement. \"You need to close your eyes, take a deep breath, and imagine yourself surrounded by an egg of light,\" a Buddhist friend said. But when I closed my eyes and took a breath, I was surrounded by used tissues and dirty laundry. Obviously, I was in need of some inner peace. Studies have shown that learning to still the mind, if only for a few minutes, can lower blood pressure, reduce heart rate, limit stress hormones, and enhance immune function. But traditional forms of meditation don't work for me. If I sit still and close my eyes, I fall asleep or think about my to-do list. So, I gave myself a new task: Find an activity that calms my mind without giving my weary body a chance to nod off. Does such a thing exist? Health.com: Making time for me . Tai chi . This ancient Chinese practice -- believed to offer all the health benefits of silent meditation while giving you something to do with your hands and feet -- seemed like an obvious place to start for an antsy, toe-tapping sort like me. The thing is, I have a poor sense of balance and tai chi often requires standing on one foot. To avoid the not-so-peaceful experience of looking like a dork in front of a group of total strangers, I opted for a DVD, with only the tiniest hope of success. I surprised myself. The quiet music and the calm voice of the middle-aged woman demonstrating the moves were so reassuring that I forgot I looked like an idiot. The effort it took to follow along in what resembles the slow-motion version of a beautiful dance was literally mesmerizing. If I didn't feel peaceful, exactly, at least I was filled with quiet concentration, the kind that banishes all thoughts of picky eaters, mortgage payments, and unreliable co-workers. I emerged from the first lesson feeling refreshed and rested. Health.com: A new prescription for happiness . Knitting . I have friends who are passionate about knitting. Don't they know that it's possible to buy an immediately wearable sweater for less than the cost of the yarn it takes to knit one? Nonetheless, stressed-out 21st-century workingwomen are returning in droves to the craft. It made no sense to me ... until I tried it, that is. Knitting, it turns out, is the perfect example of active stillness. In fact, 20 minutes of knitting can lower your heart rate and blood pressure -- the same physical response triggered by yoga, Tai Chi, or meditation. Some hospitals have even begun to offer knitting courses for stress release. The secret seems to lie in the soothing combination of rhythm and repetition. By the end of my first lesson, I'd become proficient enough that my hands could make the motions almost automatically. The sound of the needles had a metronomic quality, a calming pace that automatically slowed my thoughts. And the feel of the wool sliding through my fingers was almost like a caress. Health.com: Boost your mood with color . Walking in the woods . I'd read somewhere that exposure to nature can boost a person's general well-being and sense of calm -- and I certainly needed a dose of that. So I headed to some nearby woods where the redbuds and crab apples were in full bloom. Birds called piercingly, squirrels quarreled, and high branches clattered together in the wind. In other words, nothing about the forest was still or quiet or remotely peaceful, but somehow it made me feel peaceful. I stopped thinking about my family and work deadlines and all that laundry. In fact, I stopped thinking altogether. Back at my car, I checked the clock and was shocked to learn that more than an hour had passed. Now, I can't realistically give up an hour every day to nature. But studies have shown that even small doses of nature can be healing, so I've tried a few smaller-scale nature interactions, as well. I started a small aquarium, planted a windowsill bean garden, and hung a bird feeder where I can see it from my desk. Health.com: Make time to play . OK, so the fish aren't as interesting as I'd hoped for: Watching them swim aimlessly in their small tank, in constant motion but getting absolutely nowhere, hits a little too close to home for me. But the sight of tiny leaves unfurling on the bean vines and the scent of soil filling the room when I water them have been surprisingly gratifying. As for the bird feeder? It's the best minidose of nature I've found so far. All spring I watched goldfinches and cardinals courting right outside my window. Watching them hop from branch to branch as they get their fill and move out of the way for others to feed may not be meditation, per se, but it's something similar -- a reminder that the world can offer peace and stillness, even in the midst of mayhem.

Airplanes and helicopters will begin circling the barrier island beach later this week as federal, state and local search efforts continue, Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer told reporters on Wednesday. \"The high-resolution technology should be able to provide a detailed representation of the area and will extend through Nassau County,\" Dormer said. \"We're hoping the technology will help identify skeletal remains that may still be out there.\" The aerial imagery will supplement police-dog search units, which expected to resume searching later this week. Meanwhile, diver teams are already scouring the waterways on the north side of the barrier island. Eight different sets of confirmed human remains have been found in Suffolk County, Long Island, since December, in what police say could be the work of a serial killer or killers. Additional remains -- including a human skull -- were uncovered Monday. Police have not said whether the latest remains are from different people, or if they could have come from the eight victims. Some of the remains found Monday in a Nassau County wildlife preserve were wrapped in a \"black plastic product\" similar to a plastic bag, a law enforcement source said Wednesday. The remains \"appeared to be part of a lower extremity,\" the source said. Medical examiner investigators are trying to determine the age and sex of the remains and attempt to find out how long they were at the location before being discovered. Federal agents first joined police in their investigation in December, after four bodies had been found. That discovery on a quarter-mile stretch of Oak Beach indicates that \"they were dumped there by the same person or persons,\" Dormer told reporters at the time. \"It's too coincidental that there were four bodies in the same location.\" They were all found stuffed in bushes along an isolated strip of waterfront property. The grisly find occurred as police searched for 24-year-old Shannan Gilbert, who was last seen alive in May 2010 in the Gilgo Beach area. Gilbert's sisters said Shannan was an escort who was visiting a client. They said she ran from the man's house and called 911, claiming that someone was trying to hurt her. In a strange series of events, a local resident -- who lives a few miles from where the remains were found -- said a young woman who \"looked like she was partying all night\" came to his door at about 5 a.m. on May 1. \"She was screaming 'Help me, help me!' and said somebody was chasing her,\" said Gustav Coletti, who lives in the town of Oak Beach. He described the woman as a \"young, light-brown-haired person in her early 20s.\" Coletti said he called 911 after opening his front door to the woman, prompting her to flee into the weeds along an embankment near his house. Moments later, Coletti said an \"Asian-looking man\" man driving a dark-colored sport utility vehicle pulled up alongside his home, looking for the woman. \"Things got out of hand at a party and I'm just looking for her,\" Coletti quoted the man as saying. When Coletti told the man that he had called police, the man said he \"should not have done that\" and drove toward where girl had fled, Coletti said. But he says it took police more than four months to question him about the incident, potentially losing crucial evidence over that time frame. Coletti later told CNN that he believes the woman he saw that night was Gilbert. CNN can not independently verify that claim. Dormer said Wednesday that he has \"no idea when the detective spoke to whomever you're talking about,\" referencing Coletti. Police said they received a written statement from Coletti in June. Gilbert's body has not been among the remains identified. CNN's Allan Chernoff and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report .",

Herold suffered a ruptured aortic aneurysm Monday night, Roger Golger said. Herold \"had suffered a series of heartbreaking losses over the last several years, beginning with the death of her only child, then her husband, then her beloved chimp Travis, as well as the tragic maiming of friend and employee Charla Nash,\" Golger said. Nash lost her nose, upper and lower lips, eyelids and both her hands in the attack in February 2009, as well as the \"bony structures in her mid-face,\" according to doctors. More than a year later, numerous surgeries and therapy sessions have helped Nash regain some mobility. Her family filed a lawsuit against Herold shortly after the attack, seeking $50 million in damages. Criminal charges were not filed, however, because authorities ruled Herold was not aware of the risk her pet posed. \"This past year was particularly difficult for Sandy,\" Golger said. \"She hated living alone in a house where she faced constant reminders of the vibrant and happy life she once led with her family and friends. The stress of defending a multimillion-dollar lawsuit and all that it entailed also weighed heavy on Sandy. In the end, her heart, which had been broken so many times before, could take no more.\" The attack occurred February 16, 2009, when Herold called Nash for help in getting Travis back inside her house after he used a key to escape. When Nash arrived at the Stamford, Connecticut, home, the chimp, who had been featured in TV commercials for Coca-Cola and Old Navy, jumped on her and began biting and mauling her. Police shot Travis to halt the attack and he later died of gunshot wounds. The mauling has raised questions about whether exotic animals should be kept as pets. Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has said that primates and crocodiles should be added to a state list of animals that citizens are not allowed to own. Nash was discharged from the famed Cleveland Clinic, where doctors performed the nation's first face transplant, earlier this month. She is continuing her recovery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, where doctors have said she is a candidate for a face transplant.

Chesley Sullenberger, the hero pilot who safely landed a full passenger jet in the Hudson River, was once again honored with cheers and applause Tuesday during a ceremony for him hosted by the governor of his home state. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger gives hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger a flag and license plate. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, first lady Maria Shriver and other dignitaries greeted Sullenberger at the state Capitol rotunda in Sacramento. Taking a break from difficult negotiations over a troubled state budget, the governor presented Sullenberger with a jacket with the state seal, a California state flag that had flown over the state Capitol, a proclamation and a \"California Hero\" license plate. \"Today is a very important day,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"There are legislators upstairs that are negotiating and working on a budget -- [we] need a great hero in a state capitol.\" The Sullenberger family lives in Danville, California. Sullenberger's response was understated -- as it has been at other ceremonies, including a New York City Hall event when he was given the key to the city by Mayor Michael Bloomberg. \"On behalf of the other four crew members of Flight 1549 and also on behalf of the many thousands of aviation professionals whose daily devotion to duty keeps air travel safe, I gratefully accept this recognition,\" he said. Sullenberger and his crew safely landed the damaged airplane, believed to have hit a flock of birds, in the Hudson on January 15. All 155 passengers aboard the US Airways flight survived. CNN's Scott Thompson contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Mukono, Uganda (CNN) -- A pastor rebuked homosexuals at the funeral of a Ugandan gay rights activist, prompting chaos as sympathizers stormed the pulpit and grabbed his microphone away. David Kato, 46, a prominent rights campaigner in the east African nation, was beaten to death with a hammer this week in his house near the the capital, Kampala. His name and photo were printed on the cover of a tabloid newspaper late last year that called for gays to be executed under a banner that read: \"Hang them.\" His funeral spiraled into chaos after the pastor denounced homosexuals, saying they \"would go to hell.\" Mayhem ensued as mourners took away the pastor's microphone and police whisked him away from the angry crowds. A sympathetic Anglican bishop stepped in and laid Kato to rest as hundreds gathered Friday in the small hillside village outside the capital, Kampala. Mourners included embassy staff and diplomats from various countries, and members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community. Activists wore black T-shirts with Kato's picture on it and rainbow colored-flags associated with the gay pride. Tears -- and tributes -- flowed as family members wailed while others collapsed. A statement was read from U.S. President Barack Obama, who condemned the killing and urged authorities to swiftly bring the perpetrators to justice. Police have said initial investigations are focusing on robbery in Kato's rough Mukono neighborhood, but rights activists said he was a victim of homophobia. One suspect -- Kato's driver -- has been arrested while another man is still at large, authorities said. The second suspect is an ex-convict who was staying with Kato before his death. Human rights activist Naomi Ruzindana said the killing is not a robbery gone wrong. \"I don't think it's a coincidence that it happened ... he had got threats over and again,\" she said. Earlier this year, Kato and two activists won a case against the magazine that published the list. The court ruled that media in Uganda are barred from releasing details of known or potential homosexuals in the country. Homosexuality is illegal in most countries in Africa, where sodomy laws were introduced during colonialism. In Uganda, homosexual acts are punishable by 14 years to life in prison, according to rights activists. Ugandan lawmakers shelved a controversial \"anti-gay\" proposal introduced in 2009 that would impose tough penalties against homosexuality -- including life imprisonment and the death penalty.",

    "input": "Paris (CNN) -- An investigation into the mysterious 2009 crash of Air France Flight 447 into the southern Atlantic Ocean will also include a probe into Air France-KLM, the airline's attorney said Friday. A French magistrate already is investigating Airbus for involuntary manslaughter in connection with the crash, according to the airline manufacturer and a court spokeswoman. However, Fernand Garnault, the attorney for Air France-KLM, said he doesn't know why the airline is part of the investigation. He said the magistrate is looking into a problem involving pitot tubes, which measure a plane's air speed. Still, \"there is nothing new in this case and there is no proof that the pitot tubes caused the crash,\" Garnault told CNN. Judge Sylvie Zimmerman is presiding over the inquiry into the Airbus-made plane, court spokeswoman Sylvie Polack told CNN on Thursday. The plane fell into the sea while traveling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, killing all 228 people aboard. Thomas Enders, CEO of Airbus, disagreed with the decision to commence the investigation. \"On behalf of Airbus, I have noted the absence of facts supporting this step and stated our strong disagreement,\" Enders said in a written statement. \"Airbus maintains that the focus should be on finding the cause of this accident and making sure it can never happen again. Airbus will continue to support the investigation, including the continued search for the flight recorders, which is the only sure way to know the truth,\" he said. Investigators have not yet established what caused the crash, and large parts of the plane -- including both flight recorders -- have never been found, despite an extensive search operation that included a French navy submarine. The plane went down in stormy weather, and most of the bodies were never recovered. Studies of the debris and bodies that were found led France's air accident investigation agency, the BEA, to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA revealed in a 2009 report. Automated messages sent from the plane in the minutes before the crash showed there were problems measuring air speed, the investigators said, though they said that alone was not enough to cause the disaster. The area where the plane went down is far out in the Atlantic -- two to four days by ship from the nearest ports in Brazil or Senegal in West Africa. The rough underwater terrain includes mountains and valleys, the BEA said. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed from Los Angeles.",

Den Mohammad Darwish, the spokesman for the governor of Logar province, said he learned from locals that the American was killed. He said the body was found in the Patanak Mountains of Charkh district. He also said the vehicle the men were driving was located Sunday. A Taliban spokesman confirmed that the killed American died in a firefight and the other is being held by the group. Another official, Samar Gul Rashid -- who is the governor of the Charkh district in Logar province -- also confirmed the killing, saying he learned about it through Afghan intelligence officials. In releasing a statement Sunday, the Navy confirmed that the two missing service members are sailors. \"The thoughts and prayers of our entire Navy go out to the missing sailors serving in Afghanistan and their families,\" said Adm. Gary Roughead, chief of U.S. naval operations, in the statement. \"We have been closely following the situation from the outset. These sailors represent two of several thousand sailors serving on the ground in Afghanistan in support of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan and the International Security Assistance Force Afghanistan. \"Forces on the ground in Afghanistan are doing everything they can to locate and safely return our missing shipmates,\" Roughead said. Rashid said the second sailor, who was also abducted, is wounded and still missing. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the two Americans were driving in a civilian vehicle in the village of Dasht, in Charkh district. The Taliban wanted to take both men alive, but the firefight broke out, killing one of the Americans, Mujahid said. The other is alive and being held in a safe location, he said . There were no immediate demands from the Taliban for the return of the Americans because the group was still deliberating what its demands would be, Mujahid said. A U.S. military official confirmed that a $20,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the return of the two sailors. Posters were being distributed in the region. Adm. Mike Mullen told reporters earlier Sunday that he could not give out any information. But he did call it an \"unusual circumstance\" to have two individuals leave the base and drive over an hour away in a non-military vehicle. The two went missing after leaving their compound in the Afghan capital of Kabul, NATO said. An Afghan intelligence source told CNN that the two were abducted in Logar province, south of Kabul. The development comes as five U.S. soldiers were killed in bombings in southern Afghanistan on Saturday. CNN's Atia Abawi and Barbara Starr contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN)  -- Opposition candidate John Evans Atta Mills has narrowly won Ghana's presidential election, the Ghana Electoral Commission said on its Web site. John Atta Mills, left, of the opposition NDC has defeated Nana Akufo-Addo, right, of the ruling NPP in the runoff. The chairman of the Ghana Electoral Commission, Kwadwo Afari-Gyan, said Mills had garnered about 4,521,032 votes, or about 50.2 percent of the total votes cast. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, of the incumbent New Patriotic Party, won about 49.77 percent of the total valid votes cast, Afari-Gyan said, according to the commission's Web site. The two men led a field of eight candidates in the December 7 general election, but neither secured a majority of the votes. Akufo-Addo had held a slight lead in that vote. The runoff election was so close that it could not be decided until the last of the 230 constituencies, the Tain constituency, voted on Friday. \"On the basis of the official results given, the results of the run-off election in the Tain constituency in the Brong Ahafo Region, which was held on the 2nd January 2009, it is my duty to declare Professor John Evans Atta Mills the President-elect of Ghana,\" Afari-Gyan said, according to the government's Web site. Both parties had alleged irregularities in voting in the Ashanti region and Volta regions, but Afari-Gyan said the commission did not find evidence in \"purely electoral matters\" that invalidated the results. Mills, 64, will replace John Agyekum Kufuor as Ghana's president on January 7. Kufuor is stepping down after serving two four-year terms, the maximum allowed. Mills is a law professor who served as vice president from 1997 to 2000 under Jerry Rawlings. He lost to Kufuor in the 2000 and 2004 presidential elections. Ghana, a country about the size of England, is the world's second-biggest cocoa and gold producer. In 2007, leaders announced the discovery of oil off its shore. The world recession, however, has hindered growth. Ghana has seen a decline in its exports and will not tap into its oil resources until 2010. Part of a former British colony, Ghana was among the first African countries to gain independence in 1957. It endured a series of coups before military dictator Rawlings took power in 1981. A decade later, Rawlings led the country through the transition to a stable democracy with multi-party elections.",

However, the world No.2 showed his class by only committing 15 unforced errors, compared to the Croatian's 42. Murray earned his match with Nadal after earlier defeating John Isner 7-6 6-3 6-2. \"Murray is very good, he's one of the most talented players on tour,\" Nadal told the Australian Open Web site when quizzed about their upcoming meeting. \"He can play offensive, he can play defensive.

I don't remember him having any breakpoints. He was playing tough from the baseline and making it hard.

    "input": "GITARAMA, Rwanda (CNN) -- What does Macy's have to do with healing from genocide? Nothing and everything. Iphigenia Mukantabana sits with Jean-Bosco Bizimana, her family's killer, at her home after church. Fourteen years after Hutu extremists killed between 800,000 and 1 million people -- mostly Tutsis -- in a devastating slaughter, Rwandan women are weaving peace baskets for sale at Macy's in the United States. Not only does the work bring them a regular salary, the business is also fostering reconciliation between victim and perpetrator. Iphigenia Mukantabana, a master weaver, sits in front of her house in Gitarama -- an hour from the capital, Kigali -- making beautiful baskets with her friend Epiphania Mukanyndwi. In 1994, Mukantabana's husband and five of her children were hacked and clubbed to death by marauding Hutu militias. Among her family's killers was Jean-Bosco Bizimana, Mukanyndwi's husband. \"In my heart, the dead are dead, and they cannot come back again,\" Mukantabana said of those she lost. \"So I have to get on with the others and forget what has happened.\" Forgetting and forgiving everything she lost, everything she witnessed. \"Women and girls were raped, and I saw it all,\" she told CNN. \"The men and boys were beaten and then slaughtered. They told others to dig a hole, get in, then they piled earth on top of them, while they were still alive.\"  Watch Mukantabana say how she survived Â» . Yet today, Mukantabana shares her future and her family meals with Bizimana, the killer she knew, and his wife, her friend Mukanyndwi. Bizimana did spend seven years in jail. He then went before a tribal gathering, part of a return to traditional ways by the new government in 2002 with Rwanda's justice system unable to cope and process hundreds of thousands of imprisoned perpetrators. The government decided that the master planners and worst perpetrators would face formal justice. But lower-level killers were allowed to publicly confess and apologize to the families of their victims at gacaca courts, where elders would hear grievances and decide on the punishments. \"In the gacaca court, I told them how we killed our fellow men, and I asked for forgiveness in front of the court, and the whole district was there,\" Bizimana said. \"The people who died in this very area -- I knew all of them because they were our neighbors.\"  Watch Bizimana describe how he killed Tutsis Â» . He places blame squarely on the extremist Hutu government at the time and on vile radio broadcasts that urged on the killers during the 100-day slaughter. \"They were giving instructions all the time that was from the government, and so we thought it as the right thing because we were getting this instruction from the government,\" Bizimana said. He showed where he and a Hutu mob had killed 25 people, including members of Mukantabana's family, a few yards from where he had just shared lunch with her. \"We used machetes, hoes and wooden clubs,\" he told CNN. Mukantabana admits that it was difficult to forgive. She said she did not speak to Bizimana or his wife for four years after the killings. What put her on the road to healing, she said, was the gacaca process. \"It has not just helped me, it has helped all Rwandans because someone comes and accepts what he did and he asks for forgiveness from the whole community, from all Rwandans,\" she said. Bizimana said he did just that. \"You go in front of the people like we are standing here and ask for forgiveness,\" he said. But despite his confession and apology, Mukantabana said, reconciliation would not have happened unless she had decided to open her heart and accept his pleas. \"I am a Christian, and I pray a lot,\" she said, the pain etched in the lines on her face and around her sad eyes. But the basket business also played a key role in forging forgiveness and reconciliation after the horror. \"We knew how to weave baskets,\" Mukantabana explained. \"It helped unite Rwandans in this area because they accepted me as the master weaver, and I could not say, 'I am not taking your basket' or 'I am not helping you because you did something bad to me.' \"  See photos of the women who have learned to forgive Â» . Macy's sold the first \"peace baskets\" in 2005, and officials say the deal generates between $300,000 and $400,000 a year. A Rwandan weaver can earn about $14 per week -- a king's ransom in a country where so many live on less than $1 per week. The international project is a far cry from 1994, when the United States, Europe, the United Nations and the rest of the world turned away while the genocide went unchecked in Rwanda. \"They didn't care; they were totally indifferent,\" Rwandan President Paul Kagame told CNN in his office in Kigali. He said the world thought Rwanda \"was just another bloody African situation where people just kill each other and that's it.\"  Watch Kagame explain why he sought reconciliation Â» . Today, Rwanda is an African success story. It has one of the fastest economic growth rates in the region, one of the lowest crime rates and the lowest rate of HIV-AIDS. About one-third of Rwanda's cabinet are female ministers, and 48 percent of parliamentarians are women -- the highest anywhere in the world, according to the United Nations. The country looks squeaky clean thanks to many local and national programs, including a mandatory policy that sees even government ministers participate in clean-up once a month. Plastic bags are banned. The international business community praises Rwanda's good governance and the absence of official corruption or graft. Kagame is credited not just with turning Rwanda around, but with being the driving force behind rejecting revenge. \"We were in danger of having another genocide,\" he said. \"People were so badly aggrieved they could easily have turned on those they thought were responsible for this and actually killed them in another wave of killings. But that did not happen,\" he said. \"We said building a nation is the most important thing.\" Now no one talks about Hutus or Tutsis, he explained. \"There is Rwanda, there are Rwandans, and the common interest we have for a better future for this country is more important than any other interest.\" In Gitarama, Bizimana said, \"It hurts my heart to see that I did something wrong to friends of my family, to people who we even shared meals with,\" he said. \"I am still asking for forgiveness from the people I hurt.\" Amazingly, many seem to have forgiven.",

Lee, and later consecrated as part of Arlington National Cemetery. Last weekend, it fell -- one more casualty of the winds and heavy rains from Hurricane Irene. \"It is truly unfortunate to see it's now gone -- that tree had a significant legacy here at Arlington,\" said Steve Van Hoven, the cemetery's urban forester. The Arlington Oak, estimated to be 220 years old, stood by in stoic silence as a nation's history spread out nearby, as the acres filled with the graves of veterans, dignitaries, presidents and the fallen from war after war. For nearly half a century it shaded the area near the graves of members of the Kennedy family who were buried only yards below a slope that leads up to Lee's Arlington House mansion overlooking the Potomac River. According to Arlington National Cemetery, the oak was most known for the role it played in the selection of the grave site for President John F. Kennedy. Kennedy is said to have visited Arlington House -- now a national memorial -- in the spring of 1963 and said the view was so magnificent that he could stay there forever. The Arlington Oak was part of that view. In addition to the Arlington Oak, five other large trees were lost to Irene, including a white oak estimated to be 240 years old, according to the cemetery. Crews have been working since the storm passed to clear debris left from broken branches and smaller trees that were uprooted. It took several days to cut and clean up the trunk and branches of the majestic oak, according to the cemetery.",

    "input": "Beijing (CNN) -- A prominent Chinese human rights activist has called for an investigation into what he describes as corrupt and cruel officials who he says \"violently assaulted\" him and his family before he escaped from house arrest and fled to Beijing. Chen Guangcheng addressed the Chinese premier, Wen Jiabao, in a video posted on YouTube on Friday, detailing the abuses he said he and his family had suffered at the hands of authorities during more than 18 months of heavily guarded detention in their home. \"They broke into my house and more than a dozen men assaulted my wife,\" he said. \"They pinned her down and wrapped her in a comforter, beating and kicking her for hours. They also similarly violently assaulted me.\" Chinese authorities have not commented. The activist, who is blind, was driven to Beijing on Sunday after evading his guards in the tiny village of Dongshigu in Shandong Province, He Peirong, a friend and fellow activist, said Friday. Escape was like a Hollywood thriller . His high-profile breakout appears to have angered the local authorities who were holding him captive, with members of his family already reporting that they have suffered reprisals. Chen, 40, is a self-taught lawyer who rose to fame in the late 1990s thanks to his legal advocacy for what he called victims of abusive practices, such as alleged forced abortions, by China's family-planning officials. A local court sentenced Chen to four years and three months in prison for damaging property, disrupting traffic and \"pressurizing the government\" in a protest, according to a story from the state-run Xinhua news agency. The same 2007 story, which reported that a higher court had denied his appeal, described Chen as a \"blind mob organizer.\" His supporters have maintained authorities used trumped-up charges to silence him. Since his September 2010 release from prison, he had been confined to his home along with his wife, mother and daughter. In the video posted Friday, he said the treatment of him and his family by the local security forces \"was so cruel it has greatly harmed the image of the Communist Party.\" Calling on Wen to investigate his case, he asked: \"Is it just local officials flagrantly violating the law or do they have the support of the central government? I hope you will give the public a clear answer in the near future.\" The blind activist had prepared for his escape for months, He Peirong said, by lying in bed for prolonged periods so that the guards wouldn't be suspicious if they didn't see any activity from him for a long time. Once free, Chen contacted He Peirong and a few other activists. \"We learned that he had escaped and needed our help,\" she said, in an interview via Skype from her home city of Nanjing. They met him at a rendezvous point, and then drove him to Beijing and hid him in a safe house, He Peirong said. She said that Chen's fellow activists had decided to publicize his flight from captivity after hearing that Shandong authorities, upon discovering his disappearance, had sent people to assault members of his family. Chen Kegui, the blind activist's nephew, said in a phone conversation with a Chinese activist that local officials broke into his family's home. He said he used kitchen knives to defend himself when the officials tried to arrest him. \"I was afraid they might knock me down unconscious or beat me to death, so I went out to find somewhere safe,\" the nephew said in the conversation, a recording of which was posted online. He added that he had since called the police and was waiting for them to come and pick him up. Repeated attempts to reach Chen Kegui by phone were unsuccessful. The blind activist expressed concern in the video about the welfare of his wife, mother and daughter -- who did not escape with him and whose whereabouts were unknown Friday. \"Although I'm free, my worries are only deepening,\" he said. \"My wife, mother and children are still in their evil hands. They have been persecuting my family for a long time, and my escape would only prompt them into a mode of revenge.\" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay echoed those sentiments, saying in a statement released Friday that she is \"disturbed to hear reports that other family members ... have now been detailed.\" Noting she has raised concerns about Chen's case before, Pillay urged Chinese authorities \"to investigate the treatment of both him and his family, to ensure their physical integrity and to provide redress for any wrongdoing by local officials.\" Repeated calls seeking comment from the local authorities in Shandong went unanswered. Chen is relatively weak physically but his spirits are high, said He Peirong. There have been concerns about Chen's health during his time under house arrest, surrounded by a heavy police presence. \"He wants to live freely in his own country,\" He Peirong said. \"He said he hopes to hold my hand and take me to his village one day.\" The authorities' reaction to Chen's escape appeared to have ensnared He Peirong, too, after she spoke to CNN and other news media organizations Friday to publicize the situation. Bob Fu, the head of the U.S.-based nonprofit group ChinaAid, said that he was communicating with He Peirong via Skype when she said that state security agents had arrived at her home. Attempts to contact her since then have been unsuccessful. She had acknowledged that, by speaking out about Chen's escape, she was putting herself at risk. \"I'm not concerned about my own safety,\" she said during the Skype interview. \"I hope they'll arrest me, not my friends.\" Chen himself has been a focal point for some time, with journalists and sympathizers being prevented from visiting him. They include actor Christian Bale, who was roughed up by security guards during such an attempt in December. Last year, in a video smuggled out of the country by a U.S.-based human rights group, Chen described his dire conditions of being a prisoner in his own home. \"Those people stand at the four corners of my house, spy on my family and monitor what we do,\" he said. \"They installed floodlights and surveillance cameras around my house.\" Chen's incarceration and allegations of abuse by local officials have drawn international criticism from the likes of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Gary Locke, the U.S. ambassador to China. Women's Rights Without Frontiers, a U.S.-based nongovernmental organization that has been advocating Chen's release, urged Clinton to raise the case when she visits Beijing next month. \"We are grateful that Chen is no longer under house arrest, but we are concerned about his safety and that of his family,\" Reggie Littlejohn, the organization's president, said in a statement. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.",

The actor and the mother of his 1-year-old daughter, Lucia, both wore dark sunglasses, black business suits and emotionless expressions as they walked into a Los Angeles courtroom for a child custody hearing. Since reporters were dismissed soon after Judge Scott Gordon called their case, it is unknown if the former couple agreed on anything else. It would be unexpected, judging from their split earlier this year. Grigorieva was on the stand Monday morning, while her mother and the woman who works for Gibson as the baby's nanny were waiting to testify in the afternoon session. Gibson and Grigorieva last met in the same courtroom on November 10 for a daylong hearing that included squabbles over attorneys' fees, child support and whether they should be allowed to talk freely to the media about the family law case. Gordon stopped sort of imposing a gag order, but Gibson's lawyers have followed a self-imposed silence, citing routine confidentiality requirements in a family law case. Grigorieva, a Russian musician, decided to talk publicly -- to CNN's Larry King -- about her claims of domestic violence by Gibson. The public has already heard several recordings of angry Gibson phone calls to Grigorieva, but she told King she did not give them to celebrity news website Radaronline. Details about the case have flowed at a steady pace on celebrity news website TMZ over the past two weeks. Hundreds of pages of sealed court documents were somehow leaked, including affidavits, deposition transcripts and dental records. Even beyond the family law case, two related criminal investigations are under way. The Los Angeles County district attorney is considering evidence gathered by sheriff's investigators to decide if a domestic violence case will be made against Gibson, according to a spokeswoman for the prosecutor. Detectives are also investigating Gibson's charge that Grigorieva tried to extort him with phone recordings she made of his calls, a sheriff's spokesman said.",

Undersheriff Rick Scott said the man gave his name as Michael Thomas when the officer approached him shortly after noon inside the Grays Harbor County Courthouse in Montesano. \"He attacked her with a sharp-edged instrument,\" Scott said. \"The judge rushed to the aid of the officer and actually struck the suspect physically, knocking him off of the deputy.\" The suspect cut Superior Court Judge David Edwards in the neck. Deputy Polly Davin attempted to draw her weapon, but the suspect was able to knock her to the floor and take her weapon, officials said. The suspect fired twice, hitting the deputy once in the shoulder. Seattle affiliate KING said the man left the courthouse with the handgun. Edwards and Davin were in satisfactory condition at Grays Harbor Community Hospital, spokesman David Quigg said. \"They are comfortable and doing well,\" said Quigg, declining to detail the extent of their injuries. The suspect was still on the loose, Scott told CNN. CNN Seattle affiliate KIRO aired footage of officers in a residential neighborhood in Montesano. \"They believe he could be in a location in the area,\" said Trooper Russ Winger, a spokesman for the Washington State Patrol. \"They believe he is armed.\" Scott said officials were not certain of the suspect's true identity. The incident occurred in Montesano, the county seat for Grays Harbor County, west of Olympia and near the Pacific Coast. Many offices and buildings were placed in lockdown. According to KIRO, a man garnered the attention of courthouse employees and the officer approached him. The suspect was well-dressed and possibly carrying a briefcase, Winger said. Montesano Police did not immediately return phone messages seeking comment. Gov. Chris Gregoire appointed Edwards to the bench in December 2007.",

    "input": "(CNN)  -- Felipe Massa will not be returning to Formula One this season, his Ferrari team have officially announced. Massa is still showing the scars of the horror crash at the Hungarian GP in July. The Brazilian has been out of action since a freak crash in qualifying for the Hungarian Grand Prix left him with life-threatening head injuries. The speed of his recovery from a fractured skull has prompted speculation he could take the wheel of the Ferrari for the season-ending race in Abu Dhabi on November 1. Indeed Massa was back on the track in a private test at Ferrari's Maranello headquarters in Italy on Monday, but the team insist that is merely a stepping stone for next season. \"This is in no way a proper test session and looking at the stopwatch will not be on the agenda - there will be plenty of time for that in 2010, when, alongside Fernando Alonso, he will begin development work of the new single-seater,\" read a statement on the team's oficial Web site www.ferrari.com. Ferrari did reveal that a medical check up that Massa underwent in Paris last Friday proved \"rather positive\" but emphasized it did not signal a dream return. \"Felipe and the team want to proceed gradually and without any hurry to recover as well as possible from the effects of the accident that happened in Budapest back on 25th July. \"Therefore talk of a proper return to Formula One can wait until the start of the 2010 season and only at that time will the medical checks be carried out, as required by the FIA in order to allow someone who has been injured to return to racing.\" Giancarlo Fisichella will continue to deputize for Massa for the remaining two races of the season in Brazil and Abu Dhabi, driving alongside Kimi Raikkonen of Finland. Raikkonen is leaving the team at the end of the season to be replaced by two-time world champion Alonso, who will carry Ferrari's hopes for 2010 alongside 2008 title runner-up Massa. The 28-year-old Massa was hit in the head by a spring which fell from the Brawn GP car of fellow Brazilian Rubens Barrichello. There were fears for his life in the immediate aftermath of the horror crash as he lay in an induced for coma in a military hospital in Budapest. Seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher was slated to replace him in a sensational return to Formula One, but the German superstar had to cut short his comeback due to a neck injury. Test driver Luca Badoer proved a below-par replacement and Fisichella, who will stay at the Ferrari next season as the reserve driver, jumped ship from Force India for the drive.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Ahead of the 31st anniversary of the Iranian Revolution, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said his country will show its support to the revolution on February 11. \"Our revolution has changed the patterns and the equations of the world,\" he said in a nationally televised interview. Ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the Ten Days of Dawn, which lead up to the anniversary of the Islamic Revolution. He said that enemies who plotted against Iran during the election protests last year continue to plot, but despite all the economic sanctions on the country, they are not succeeding. \"This year, they have mobilized themselves again to harm the Iranian nation and to stop them, but they failed,\" he said, adding that the capitalist powers who are against Iran have peaked. Specifically, he cited the United States and United Kingdom as nations that have tried to interfere with Iran's domestic issues. \"They adopted their stances, and they failed,\" Ahmadinejad said. \"This is a clear defeat for them.\" On the nuclear issue, Ahmadinejad said that Iran seeks such production for peaceful purposes only. The United States and other nations have expressed concern that Iran wants to acquire nuclear weapons. The same countries who doubt Iran could, instead, partner with Iran and build the nuclear plants themselves if they wanted, he said. \"Russia, France and the United States can come and sign contracts to build the power plants. It serves our interests as well as theirs. Of course, if they don't come to do this, we will reach a point [where we will] build our own power plant,\" he said. The Iranian leader also mentioned the three American hikers who have been detained, saying that negotiations are ongoing. \"We don't like anyone in jail or in prison, but these people have violated our borders, and it has a defined penalty,\" he said, adding that there are Iranians \"languishing within American jails.\" He hinted at a possible prisoner swap. \"We are approaching this from a humanitarian perspective and see how it goes,\" Ahmadinejad said. U.S. State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid said the United States is prepared to answer any questions about Iranians in U.S. custody. \"It's hard to know what he meant from these fragmentary comments, but we have made clear that we want consular access to our citizens in Iranian custody,\" Duguid said. \"If President Ahmadinejad's comments suggest that they are prepared to grant us access through the Swiss and resolve the cases of the three hikers and others in custody, we would welcome that step. It is long overdue.\" CNN's Jill Dougherty contributed to this report.",

Exxon Mobil's refinery in Baytown, Texas, is one of four that the EPA said had high sulfur emissions. The Justice Department announced Wednesday that the oil giant agreed to pay $6.1 million after Environmental Protection Agency officials determined the company had not sufficiently reduced sulfur emissions in its refineries in Baytown and Beaumont, Texas; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and Torrance, California. Exxon Mobil had paid a $7.7 million fine in its original 2005 agreement with the government and promised to install new emissions controls at the refineries. The petroleum company said after the latest settlement its refineries now meet the required EPA standards on sulfur emissions. The company's role in environmental pollution has been in the spotlight ever since the 1989 Exxon Valdez accident in Alaska, the worst oil spill in U.S. history. This past summer, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the company to pay $507 million in punitive damages from the incident, down from an original $2.5 billion judgment.",

Mikhail Khodorkovsky, once Russia's richest man, is imprisoned in a work camp 4,000 miles from Moscow. \"Concerning the possibility of a pardon for someone, Khodorkovsky or anyone else, the procedure has to be carried out in accordance with our country's rules,\" President Dmitry Medvedev said in a transcript on his Web site. \"In other words, a person must appeal to the president, plead guilty to having committed a crime and seek the appropriate resolution.\" The president dismissed talks of a pardon, saying, \"at this point, there is nothing to discuss.\" Khodorkovsky once headed the Yukos oil company, once Russia's largest oil producer. He is serving a nine-year sentence for fraud and tax evasion. Medvedev described corruption as a \"very serious Russian disease\" and emphasized the need to fight it. \"To this end, we have enacted a number of measures, including new legislation on corruption and special arrangements relating to government officials, their disclosures, declarations of income and so on,\" he said. \"We are determined to continue this work, because we believe it is extremely important.\" The former oil magnate is incarcerated in a work camp near the town of Krasnokamensk, 4,000 miles (6,500 kilometers) from his native Moscow. He has been imprisoned since his arrest in 2003. Khodorkovsky had expressed a desire to run for office at the time and funded opposition political parties. He said the trial was part of a Kremlin campaign to destroy him and take the company he built from privatization deals of the 1990s. The Kremlin denied any role in his downfall. Yukos, which has since been crushed by a $27.5 billion back-tax bill, has been the object of a lengthy campaign by prosecutors and tax authorities. The court also ordered Khodorkovsky and his partner to pay about $600 million in back taxes.",

Feller was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in August and underwent surgery at the Cleveland Clinic to implant a pacemaker in October. In mid-November, Feller was hospitalized with pneumonia. The major leaguer was an icon for Indians fans. \"We in Cleveland have been blessed to have had him with us these many years,\" said Indians owner Larry Dolan. \"To say he will be missed is such an understatement.\" Feller spent 18 years in a Cleveland Indians uniform. He started 484 games, winning 266 of them. Feller had a lifetime ERA of 3.25, threw three no-hitters, including the only Opening Day no-hitter in Major League Baseball history, on April 16, 1940. In 1946, he pitched 36 complete games. \"Since 1936 he has been with us. For 75 years he has been a contributing citizen, a model for all athletes, and friend of thousands,\" Dolan said. \"As so it shall be in the larger sense, Bob will be with us always. Not at Opening Day, not at Fantasy Camp, not in the Press Box, but in our hearts.\" Indians manager Manny Acta said Feller was a special person. \"There has never been a great one with such an affiliation to his original franchise,\" Acta said. \"When you think Cleveland Indians, you think Bob Feller and vice-versa.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Anyone who uses a smartphone, puts away money in a 401(k), or wants to keep their grocery bill from skyrocketing needs to be aware of a new dynamic in the world economy. It's called the \"Plan B World\" and it is about how modern shocks to systems in far corners of the world are now having a direct impact on local employment and economies, including the parts that go into cell phones, the financial markets that house our retirement savings and the global agriculture system. We saw the downside of single-source supply contracting and just-in-time inventory systems when a manufacturing plant for a certain type of gasket was destroyed in the 2011 Japanese tsunami. It led to the shutdown of production facilities in the big six automakers in the United States, which weakened the economy and contributed to the U.S. unemployment rate increasing from 8.9% to 9.1% during this time. If carmakers had a Plan B for gasket supply, an economic disruption that put factory employees out of work could have been avoided. Advancements in supply chain technology have improved efficiency and lowered the prices we pay for goods and services. But without a mindset that recognizes that we are in a Plan B world, we are lessÂ resilient to the acute shocks and chronic stresses our world faces every day. The Plan B mindset will allow us to use our creativity to proactively plan for more resilient solutions. By that I mean developing ways that people, communities, industries and even nations are better able to rebound in the face of adversity and come back even stronger. What makes this important? The speed of change -- along with the increasing environmental, economic, social and political volatility -- has led to crises of intensifying frequency, scale and severity, with potentially catastrophic effects that cascade across sectors and geographies. A reality of our time is that we cannot anticipate every catastrophe or stressful event.Â Â We can -- and must -- do what we can to prevent bad things from happening, but the fact remains that surprises will still happen.Â Â Ominous recent episodes demand we always have a Plan B that minimizes the lasting effects of a range of future threats and allows us to rebound more quickly and effectively: . â¢ Climate catastrophes, like the deadly floods that paralyzed Thailand in 2011, can trigger disruptions to the world's tenuous manufacturing supply chain. When the autumn flooding in Bangkok closed factories that fed global manufacturers, it forced shutdowns of electronics and automotive assembly lines from Shanghai to Shenzen to Shreveport. â¢ Financial contagion, like the debt crises of Greece and Portugal in 2010 and 2011, can shatter confidence in global financial markets. Losses inflicted by the European crises reversed years' worth of painstaking economic progress for nations and individuals worldwide. â¢ Food shortages, like the drought-induced famine emergency in Somalia and Ethiopia in 2011, can cause food riots locally and speculative panics globally. Such market gyrations can contribute to protectionist measures that drive worldwide food-price spikes and further punish the most vulnerable. â¢ True natural disasters, like last year's Japanese earthquake and tsunami, can expose dangers in nationwide planning systems and calamities in power and other sectors. The sudden discovery of structural weakness in many of Japan's nuclear power plants forced the shutdown of its nuclear electricity network, with the power outage provoking an economic stall. â¢ Disease pandemics, like the SARS outbreak that swept through Asia in 2002 and 2003, can spread infections across borders as fast as 747s can ferry passengers across oceans. â¢ Cyberattacks and hacking can undermine public faith in the secure data that supports global commerce. Further, the infiltration of infrastructure networks and military systems can compromise national security. A Plan B would not just build higher levees and a more regulated banking system.Â Â It would look at ways of setting up redundant systems so that when one system fails another takes up some of the slack.Â Â Or when we design our flood or economic plans, can we keep in mind ways to prevent cascading failures when one part of the system collapses? There are already some Plan Bs being put in place.Â  Two examples come from work that the Rockefeller Foundation is supporting today. â¢ In Ethiopia, some of the poorest subsistence farmers in the country are receiving crop insurance through an innovative program spearheaded by Oxfam America that allows farmers to trade work for insurance. This makes farmers more resilient against drought, famine and floods. â¢ The Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network is a 10-city initiative to develop climate resilience strategies appropriate to each city.Â Â One of the cities where the program is operating is Danang, Vietnam.Â  Their strategy included hydrology mapping, which led the city to halt building plans in vulnerable areas and has shaped the city's future development plans.Â  This planning will reduce the vulnerability of people and property to the effects of climate changes. This is only a start.Â  How we strengthen Plan Bs and interconnect them is the focus of a meeting this week in Washington that is bringing together global leaders and thinkers across an array of fields.Â Â From these discussions, a clearer way forward will be developed, that will be followed by grants aimed at achieving this goal. This is just one step toward a more resilient world. It is long past time for everyone to work together to reinforce society's complex systems at their most vulnerable points. We are on our way. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Judith Rodin.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Days after blocking a Gaza-bound flotilla, Greece's government offered Sunday to ship aid to the Palestinian territory -- a move applauded by the U.N. chief but derided as insufficient by protest organizers and Palestinian authorities. Greece's foreign ministry released a statement Sunday afternoon in which it proposed to \"undertake the task of transporting the humanitarian aid, with Greek vessels or other appropriate means, through existing channels.\" That same day, Foreign Minister Stavros Lambrinidis talked by phone with U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The U.N. chief \"thanked\" the Greek official and \"expressed support for the Greek initiative,\" according to a statement from the United Nations. \"In his view, it could help to reduce tensions in the region and ensure much-needed aid is delivered to those who need it in Gaza,\" the U.N. statement said of Ban's views, adding the world body will \"work closely with Greece, Israel and Palestinian authorities on this matter.\" However, one Palestinian official, chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erakat, said that funneling food, cement and other goods via other means, such as Greek ships, missed the point, which he said is to \"immediately lift, not ease\" Israel's maritime blockade of Gaza. He lauded those behind the flotilla as people \"who have dedicated their time, effort and passion for a just cause.\" \"The situation in Gaza is not about border crossings,\" Erakat said Sunday in a statement. \"It is about the illegally denied and internationally recognized rights of the Palestinian people to dignity, freedom and self-determination.\" A spokeswoman for The Audacity of Hope, a U.S. ship full of activists (but no humanitarian aid) that was barred last week by Greek authorities from sailing to Gaza, said the Greek offer \"doesn't really address the issue for us, (which is) ending the naval blockade.\" \"It's all very well and good that there are some channels (for aid to Gaza),\" Leslie Cagan said. \"But that is not the same as lifting the siege of Gaza.\" The vessel's captain, John Klusmire, remained in Greek custody on Sunday, one day after being asked to report to a police station. A spokesperson with the Greek Coast Guard, who was not named per custom, said Klusmire, an American, was arrested because he left the mainland without permission and put passengers in danger. He will appear before Greek prosecutors on Tuesday. Jane Hirschmann, one of the flotilla organizers, called the arrest \"intimidation\" aimed at likewise preventing the other nine boats in the flotilla from setting sail to Gaza. On Sunday, eight passengers from the U.S. ship began a hunger strike outside the U.S. Embassy in Athens, demanding their captain's release and allowing the ship to set sail. The vessel -- which carried 36 American passengers, four crew members and several journalists, including CNN reporter Phil Black -- was intercepted last Friday by a Greek Coast Guard patrol vessel roughly 10 minutes after it had departed Perama. After an hours-long standoff, the ship eventually returned to Greece, where it is tied up at a Greek naval facility. The Audacity of Hope and the nine other ships are aiming to promote public awareness about Israel's blockade of Gaza and, in part, to commemorate a May 2010 incident in which Israeli troops boarded Mavi Marmara, a Turkish ship filled with humanitarian aid and 700 activists from various countries. Nine people died in subsequent clashes with Israeli Navy commandos. Cagan said that while the American ship's crew are frustrated they haven't been able to head to Gaza, there is some degree of satisfaction that their cause has drawn attention and provoked debate worldwide. \"People went to Athens and still would like to complete the mission,\" said Cagan, who is in the United States but is in close contact with her fellow activists in Greece. \"At the same time, the feeling is very good that important work is being done that is shedding more light on the situation, with the whole blockade.\" The Greek government has said it won't allow any of the boats in the flotilla to sail to Gaza because their mission is too dangerous. Flotilla members accuse the Greek government of buckling to pressure from Israel's government. For their part, the Israelis have said they are mounting a diplomatic offensive to try to stop the flotilla from setting sail at all. On Tuesday, the Israeli government said flotilla participants had threatened to kill Israeli military personnel should their boats be boarded. They said that the participants were stockpiling sacks of sulfuric acid on boats to be used in the event of any attacks on Israeli commandos. Flotilla organizer Medea Benjamin dismissed the allegations Tuesday as ludicrous, saying: \"They see this nonviolent, ragtag group of ships as such a threat they're using their entire propaganda apparatus, and their diplomatic and economic clout to try to stop 300 peace activists. It's pathetic.\" The Middle East Quartet -- composed of officials from the United States, United Nations, European Union and Russia -- on Saturday issued a joint statement asking \"all governments concerned to use their influence to discourage additional flotillas, which risk the safety of their participants and carry the potential for escalation.\" The Quartet added in its statement that it \"strongly urges all those wishing to deliver goods to the people of Gaza to do so through established channels, so that their cargo can be inspected and transferred via established land crossings.\" Doing so, the group contends, is the best way to both help Palestinians and address Israel's \"legitimate security concerns.\" On Sunday, Erakat said that while Palestinian leaders \"support international engagement in lifting the unjust and inhumane Israeli blockade,\" the Quartet's statement and their opposition to the planned flotilla to Gaza skirt the broader challenges in the region. \"We invite them to focus on resolving the root cause of the conflict, which is the occupation, rather than seeking ways to manage its destructive symptoms.\" Erakat said of the Quartet. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The early-morning slaughter of four Florida siblings at the hands of what authorities say was their mother is an \"almost unheard of\" case, crime experts said Wednesday. Investigators are still trying to determine what happened at the Port St. John home of 33-year-old Tonya Thomas early Tuesday morning. But Patricia Pearson, author of \"When She was Bad: How and Why Women Get Away with Murder,\" said mass killings with women as a perpetrator are rare -- and when they do happen, they typically aren't committed with guns. \"If a gun was used, that's almost unheard of,\" Pearson told CNN. Women make up about 5% of the ranks of mass killers, said James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University. And most cases in which women kill their families involve young children, said Fox, the author of \"Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder.\" Sheriff's deputies in Brevard County say Thomas turned a .38-caliber revolver on herself after killing her two sons, 15-year-old Jaxs Johnson and 12-year-old Joel Johnson, and two daughters, 17-year-old Pebbles Johnson and 13-year-old Jazlin Johnson. The children went to a neighbor's house when the shooting started, with at least one reporting being shot, according to recordings of 911 calls released by the sheriff's department Tuesday -- but they returned while neighbors were on the phone with deputies, and more shots followed. \"The two kids were in the front yard, one banging on the front door, 'Help us! Help us!'\" a neighbor told dispatchers. \"There was so much confusion going on we couldn't tell who shot who, and then when I was talking to you the one kid said his mom shot him.\" \"I cried so much,\" slain boy's classmate says . Investigators don't know a motive for the killings, said Lt. Tod Goodyear, a spokesman for the Brevard County Sheriff's Office. But he said neighbors have described a history of public arguments among Thomas and her children, and Jaxs Johnson was arrested after a pair of fights with his mother in April. The teen was charged with domestic violence after a pair of fights with his mother, according to records released by the sheriff's office. In the first, on April 8, he knocked out a window with his bicycle during a fight; Thomas told deputies \"she is attempting to get him into different programs to help with his issues.\" The following day, she said, her son punched and kicked her when she tried to wake him for school, then ran out of the house. She again called deputies, who arrested him on April 10, Goodyear said. He spent at least two days in juvenile detention after the arrest and had a court date scheduled for Tuesday, Goodyear said. Thomas herself had been arrested on domestic violence charges in 2002, after a fight with her former boyfriend, the children's father, Goodyear said. Fox said the circumstances appear to be a case of \"suicide by proxy,\" in which a family member takes the lives of her loved ones \"out of a warped sense of love\" before killing herself. \"Typically, the perpetrator is suicidal, feels life is miserable and doesn't want to go on,\" Fox said. \"But why does she take her children? Because she wished to be reunited them in the afterlife or wants to spare them the misery of this life.\" Usually the victims in such cases are young children, however -- \"partly because young children are vulnerable,\" he said. \"Older kids can run away.\" And the reported circumstances are \"really unusual,\" far different from typical cases involving either women or men. In an e-mail to CNN, Pearson said that in cases where women kill their children, \"They target them because that is their sphere of power, and also their source of stress.\" But she added, \"I've never seen a case where the children were this old, however. They're almost always under 5.\"",

The 19-year-old Santos star is reported to be a transfer target for both Real Madrid and Chelsea when the season finishes and his display against the Scots will have only further enhanced his reputation. Neymar has now scored three times in three appearances for his country as Brazil got back to winning form after recent defeats by both France and Argentina. Brazil were always in control against a side that had never beaten them in nine previous meetings and they took the lead three minutes before half-time. Andre Santos played a superb cross in from the left for Neymar, who was given too much space in the area before curling a low shot into the corner of the net. And it was Neymar who secured the victory in the 77th minute, scoring from the penalty spot after he had been fouled in the area by Charlie Adam. Meanwhile, the United States and Argentina shared a 1-1 draw in their friendly match at New Meadowlands Stadium, home of the NFL's New York Giants and New York Jets.

    "input": "Palo Alto, California (CNN) -- It wasn't until five months after Army Staff Sgt. June Moss returned from the Iraq war in 2003 that her real battle began. The horrors of the war -- witnessing decapitated and burned bodies amid mass destruction -- led to post-traumatic stress disorder. \"I do notice when I'm stressing out that I start having dreams about what I saw and how I felt,\" says Moss, now 40 and retired from the Army. \"It does come back as if to haunt you.\" The percentage of women in the military has doubled in the last 30 years, with more than 350,000 serving as of 2009, according to the Department of Veterans Affairs' latest figures. With more female troops in combat, there has been an increase in PTSD diagnoses: One in five female veterans suffer from PTSD, according to the VA. As a light-vehicle mechanic, Moss drove across Baghdad and provided security at checkpoints during her combat tour in Iraq. When she returned home, she became overly protective of her two children, fearing that someone was going to kidnap or harm them. At the same time, she hunkered down inside her home, staying in bed, because she says it was too hard to face the most mundane tasks such as shopping. \"It was crazy. I couldn't even do crowds. It reminded me when we were in a marketplace (in Iraq), and we didn't know if somebody was out there to kill us,\" Moss explains. \"I'm back home, and I didn't have to worry about a suicide bomber, but I still felt as if there was one lurking in the mall or the grocery store.\" Six years ago, she cut her wrists to end the pain. Today, Moss has progressed significantly after specialized therapy provided by the local Veterans Affairs in Palo Alto, California, where the focus is on female vets like herself. \"Women tend to be diagnosed more often, at least with our recent returnees, with depression, whereas men are being diagnosed more often with substance abuse,\" says Natara Garovoy, program director of the Women's Prevention, Outreach & Education Center at VA Palo Alto Health Care System. Garovoy says recent studies show the percentage of women veterans suffering from PTSD is on par with the percentage of men: 20%. \"Women are exposed to combat now more than ever before, and they're proving to be just as resilient to those exposures as men,\" she said. There is no cure for PTSD, only treatment. \"It takes a lot to live with PTSD,\" Moss says. \"I hate to compare it with being an alcoholic, because I'm not one, but that's the best description I can give. You're always one incident from spiraling out of control back to where you were -- being depressed, not coming out of the house, not being able to sleep, having night terrors, night sweats, all those kinds of things.\" Moss attributes an angry outburst in her workplace last year to PTSD, after she says she had become complacent with her treatment. Moss physically struck a fellow employee with whom she was romantically involved. \"I just went off. It went from verbal to physical. And, thank God, I didn't lose my job over it. But I did get in trouble,\" says Moss, who was suspended for three days without pay. \"Those feelings came out of nowhere.\" Moss says she realized that even years later, she needed to actively engage in her weekly therapy. She also turned to her boss, the chaplain at the Palo Alto VA, to focus on her spirituality. \"I'm constantly working on how I'm thinking,\" Moss says of her regimen today, which includes morning meditation, listening to gospel music and exercising. Her new mantra: \"Staying positive and keeping negativity out of my life!\" Moss has lost 40 pounds in the last two years and is pursuing a degree in human resource management at San Francisco's Golden Gate University. Moss beams with pride when she discusses recent steps in her therapy made within the last six months. She went on a trip by herself to Philadelphia while her teenage children went away to camp.

    "input": "ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Samuel Welsh's chances of landing a job before this economic downturn were already slim. Samuel Welsh, laid off since 2006, has found solace in his faith. \"You got to keep God in your heart,\" he said. Now, as a disabled worker, the 29-year-old is competing with thousands of nondisabled job seekers going for jobs once allocated for the disabled population. Welsh was laid off from his job as an executive assistant in 2006. \"I did mortgages, refinances and purchase deals. I was dismissed from that job and after that I was sent over to the Bobby Dodd Institute to do my vocational rehab counseling,\" he said. The Bobby Dodd Institute in Atlanta provides job training and rehabilitation for people with disabilities. Meg Godfrey, an employment specialist with BDI, has been handling Welsh's case. \"He came to us originally looking for a position in administrative clerical type work. We have lowered his goals to greeting and ticket-taking, but those are the first jobs that go in this type of economy,\" she said. As part of her job, Godfrey seeks potential employers who will allocate some of their positions for people with disabilities, but as unemployment has soared, competition has gotten fierce. \"Usually, we can get three to five jobs a month. Lately it's been one or no jobs each month. There are some employers I have talked to about hiring our clients. It's in a restaurant-type business and they have people coming in and putting applications that have previously worked at Morgan Stanley,\" she said. For Welsh, the competition and the wait have proven too long. He recently started a home cake-making business using cooking skills he learned from his grandmother when he was growing up in Alabama. He gets orders from local clients and delivers the cakes with the aid of public transit for the disabled. He gets about three orders a week, at an average price of $15 per cake. Welsh said he evaluated his skills and abilities before starting his business. \"I know that I can bake cakes. I know that people like cakes; people like to eat a little something sweet, \" he said. He added that he has not lost hope about finding a job. Wayne McMillan, CEO of BDI, says job numbers for people with disabilities show little hope. \"It's terrible to be without a job in this country. It's tragic to have a disability and be without a job. We are having people come through the programs that we are not being able to place. Last year we placed 171 folks; during the month of December zero; January two. This is a real crisis for us,\" McMillan said. For the first time, the Department of Labor in February released a report tracking unemployment rates among disabled job seekers. The survey found a 14 percent unemployment rate among disabled workers -- almost double that of the nondisabled population. And only 21 percent of the available working disabled population is employed, compared with the 65 percent of nondisabled workers. \"It is not at the top of most people's minds,\" said Megan Rutter Branch, director of communication for BDI. \"They are seeing family members go off and have the dignity of work, and earn a paycheck, and the only expectation that is had of them is to sit at home, watch TV and stay out of trouble.\" She emphasized that disabled workers have one of the highest retention rates in the industry, 82 percent to 87 percent, according to BDI figures. \"Our folks wouldn't want to leave. They had to overcome all these hurdles to get a job.\" According to the U.S. Census, people with disabilities comprise the largest minority group, approximately 20 percent of the population. Robin L. Shaffert, senior director of corporate social responsibility with the American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), says it is critical for this group to be included in economic recovery plans. \"It is very important for our society that we are using all the productive force of our society. It is important that we are also looking at people with disabilities and make sure we are looking for solutions for them as well,\" Shaffert said. AAPD research shows that President Obama's economic stimulus package has allocated funds to help people with disabilities, such as increased Medicaid help, vocational rehabilitation, help with independent living and specialized education. Until that help comes, Welsh, who suffers from spina bifida, says he is holding onto his faith. \"You got to keep God in your heart. As long as you got him in your side everything will go smoothly,\" he said.",

The seven-time world champion has struggled to challenge for a podium place in three races since returning to motorsport's elite class, and has been outperformed by young teammate Nico Rosberg. But Brawn, whose team won the world title last year after a scintillating start to the campaign, believes that the 41-year-old Schumacher has suffered from problems not within his control. While Rosberg claimed third place in Malaysia, Schumacher was forced to retire with a wheel nut problem. \"Achieving our first podium of the season with Nico was very rewarding in Malaysia at the home race of our title partner Petronas and a timely boost for the team,\" Brawn told F1's official Web site. \"Michael also had a strong weekend and is getting more up to speed with every race, although circumstances beyond his control limited his race performance in Melbourne and Sepang. \"We hope to continue these signs of improvement in China and it would be particularly good for Michael to be able to have a clean race and show the progress that he has made since the start of the season. \"I am very pleased with the performance of our drivers. We've achieved a reasonable set of results which are in line with the car's current pace, but we have to be realistic and acknowledge that we are not quick enough to compete right at the front at the moment. This is obviously not a situation that we are happy with and we are working as hard as possible to close the gap.\" Schumacher is 10th in the drivers' standings after finishing sixth and 10th in the first two races, while fellow German Rosberg is fifth -- four points behind overall leader Felipe Massa of Ferrari. \"The enthusiasm for Mercedes-Benz and the support of the fans is very big in China so we have an attractive race ahead of us in Shanghai next weekend, Schumacher said. \"I am confident that the fans will not leave the race disappointed. We looked quite reasonable in Malaysia at the last race and maybe things will play into our hands again in Shanghai. I am looking forward to the race and fully enjoying the competition again. \"Admittedly the last two races have not been very fortunate for me, but I am very much aware of the reasons for it. I know how things go in F1 and if you look into the detail of the two races, I think everything is still going according to plan. You can only improve step by step, and I am confident that we are achieving this.\"",

Bryant Purvis says he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball. Purvis, who was facing charges of second-degree attempted murder and conspiracy, entered a not guilty plea to the reduced charges in the LaSalle Parish Courthouse in Jena. Charges have now been reduced against at least five of the students in the racially charged \"Jena 6\" case. Charges against Jesse Ray Beard, who was 14 at the time of the alleged crime, are unavailable because he's a juvenile. Civil rights leaders Martin Luther King III and Al Sharpton led more than 15,000 marchers to Jena -- a town of about 3,000 -- in September to protest how authorities handled the cases against Purvis and five other teens accused of the December 2006 beating of fellow student Justin Barker. After the arraignment, Purvis said he has moved to another town to complete high school. He said he is focusing on his studies and practicing basketball, which he hopes to play in college. Mychal Bell, 17, is the only one of the \"Jena 6\" teens still in jail. Although he was released in September after his adult criminal conviction for the beating was overturned, he was ordered two weeks later to spend 18 months in a juvenile facility for a probation violation relating to an earlier juvenile conviction. A district judge tossed out Bell's conviction for conspiracy to commit second-degree battery, saying the matter should have been handled in juvenile court. The 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal in Lake Charles, Louisiana, did the same with Bell's battery conviction in mid-September.

The documents were filed in U.S. District Court in Louisville, Kentucky, because the suspect was arrested near there Monday after allegedly leaving Australia last week. Arrest in baffling collar-bomb case . Surveillance video, a memory stick and Internet records helped officials track down Paul Douglas Peters, 50, according to the complaint for provisional arrest. Australian police plan to seek charges against Peters that include kidnapping, aggravated breaking and entering with intent to commit a serious indictable offense, and demanding property by force with intent to steal, according to the complaint. They are expected to ask for his extradition. Authorities in Australia and the United States linked Peters to the case through files in a USB thumb drive that was attached to the fake bomb placed around the neck of the 18-year-old daughter of the targeted family, according to the complaint filed on behalf of Australian authorities. On August 3, Peters allegedly broke into a home in Mosman, Australia, wearing a mask and carrying a baseball bat that he purchased using his own credit card, the complaint says. He allegedly looped a black box around the young woman's neck, claiming in an accompanying note that it contained \"powerful new technology plastic explosives,\" according to the complaint. He instructed the family to contact an e-mail address for further instructions. Authorities were able to determine the e-mail account was created May 30 at a Chicago airport, when Peters was traveling there. It was accessed only three times, all in the hours following the break-in, police said. One access occurred at a library in Kincumber, Australia; the other two were at a business in Avoca Beach, Australia. Each of the log-ins coincides with the video-recorded arrival of a man resembling Peters at the library and near a video store where the account was accessed, according to the complaint. The USB drive draped around the victim's neck also contained a file that had been created on a computer named \"Paul P,\" according to the complaint. Analysis of the memory stick showed an undeleted PDF file that contained \"an exact replica of the demand letter that was left\" with the young woman, it said. Deleted files included letters of demand and references to explosive devices and demands for money, the complaint alleges. The documents were signed off with the suspect e-mail account. Video showed a silver Range Rover parked near the library at the time of the incident. Police learned it was made between 1996 and 2001, according to the complaint. A search of Ranger Rovers on record in the area led police to Peters' address, according to the complaint. The investment banker left the country August 8 for Chicago and subsequently traveled to Louisville the next day, the complaint states. On Thursday, an FBI agent spotted Peters in the back yard of his former wife's residence in Buckner, Kentucky, and arrest warrants were issued by Australian authorities on Friday and Saturday. The complaint says that \"police have obtained information that Paul Douglas Peters was formerly employed by a company with which the victim's family has links.\"",

An F-22A fighter jet similar to this one crashed Wednesday during a test mission in California. The single-seater crashed about 10:30 a.m. (1:30 p.m. ET) for unknown reasons, Air Force officials said. Lockheed Martin said the test pilot, David Cooley, 49, of Palmdale, California, joined the company in 2003 and was a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force. The fighter was on a test mission when it crashed about 35 miles northeast of  Edwards AFB, where it was stationed, the Air Force said in a news release. At $150 million apiece, the F-22A is the most expensive Air Force fighter. In 2004, an F-22 Raptor crashed on a training mission in the Nevada desert. The pilot ejected and was not hurt, though the jet was destroyed. The plane was designed in the 1980s to provide a stealthy method to enter Soviet air space and strike Soviet bombers if the USSR attempted a nuclear strike. Once the Cold War ended, the Air Force found a new mission for the F-22 as a long-range fighter with a sophisticated stealth design and state-of-the-art equipment that no other plane could rival. However, the rising cost of the plane and numerous design and software problems threatened the program, which was almost eliminated by Congress. In the end, the aircraft survived, and most of the problems were fixed -- except for the price tag, which forced the Air Force to buy fewer aircraft.",

German rider Stefan Schumacher is a member of the Gerolsteiner team. Gerolsteiner, who have been team sponsors since 1998, said there was a change in marketing strategy. Gerolsteiner has invested around $12 million annually in the team, which includes riders Stefan Schumacher, Fabian Wegmann, Markus Fothen and Robert Foerster. Gerolsteiner said on Tuesday they were no longer reaching their targeted audience through cycling because it was changing from being solely a producer of mineral water to a supplier of nonalcoholic drinks. Gerolsteiner team chief Hans-Michael Holczer was deeply upset by the news. \"There were tears in my eyes,\" said Holczer. The German Cycling Federation (BDR) said they would help the team to find a new sponsor. \"It is not an entirely unexpected decision. After such a long collaboration, you notice changes in your partner,\" said Holczer, who will begin the hunt for a new sponsor. \"We have one of the best teams on the market with a national and international reputation.\" The T-Mobile cycling team has fired rider Lorenzo Bernucci after his positive doping test at the Tour of Germany last month. Bernucci violated the team's code of conduct and was removed from T-Mobile's roster at the Spanish Vuelta, the team said on Tuesday. He tested positive for a non-amphetamine appetite suppressant. Bernucci is licensed by the Monaco cycling federation, which will be responsible for further investigation and possible additional sanctions, T-Mobile said. He tested positive on August 15 for the substance sibutramine, an appetite suppressant sold under various brand names, such as Reductil and Ectiva. The world governing body of cycling, UCI, informed T-Mobile of Bernucci's positive test. Bernucci told team management that he had been using Ectiva for four years and had purchased it over the counter at a pharmacy in Italy, not knowing it been added to the list of prohibited substances by the World Anti-Doping Agency, T-Mobile said. According to UCI rules, a first violation for sibutramine -- if it is determined that it was not intended as a performance enhancer -- can result in anything between a warning and a one-year suspension. \"We do not know if this was an attempt at performance enhancement or just poor judgment,\" T-Mobile team chief Bob Stapleton said. \"But we know it is unacceptable that riders take any medication without the approval of the team doctor.

Other high-performing states were Minnesota, Vermont, New Hampshire and New Jersey. The area with the lowest marks in both grades was the District of Columbia, though the report showed that the district -- along with Nevada, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont -- had improved its scores since the last tests were taken in 2007. The average scores were categorized at each grade level into four groups: below basic, basic, proficient, and advanced. According to the Department of Education, some of the skills required to achieve a basic level of understanding of mathematics at the fourth-grade level include performing simple computations with whole numbers; showing understanding of fractions and decimals; and solving simple real-world problems. To achieve a basic level of understanding at the eighth-grade level, students must be able work with whole numbers, decimals, fractions and percentages; be able to solve word problems and use diagrams, charts and graphs; and be able to solve simple algebra and geometry problems. Scores were slightly higher in the 2009 report than they were in 2007, but Duncan said more needs to be done. \"Our students need to graduate high school ready to succeed in college and the workplace,\" he said.

Canada agreed this month to extend its commitment of about 2,500 troops until 2011 so long as NATO contributes more troops to Kandahar. There is a \"clear unity in the alliance\" that the mission in Afghanistan must succeed, Appathurai said. Though 25 NATO allies and 13 other countries have contributed forces, the bulk of the recent fighting has been done by U.S., Canadian, British and Dutch troops. Appathurai also said Thursday that he did not expect NATO applicants Georgia and Ukraine to be put on a membership action plan this summit but, he said, the general sense in terms of membership for the two countries is not \"whether, but when.\" Further discussions regarding those two countries is to resume Thursday, he said. U.S. President George W. Bush has pushed for the admission of Ukraine and Georgia to the military alliance. However, Russia -- which is not a NATO member -- has expressed concerns about the former Soviet republics joining NATO, which has already made members of other former Soviet countries Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. Appathurai also said a general consensus could not be reached on Macedonia's bid, because of Greece's objections. Greece has threatened to veto Macedonia's bid if its northern neighbor does not agree to change its name. Athens has long argued that the name Macedonia implies territorial claims on its northern province of the same name -- the birthplace, also, of Greece's most revered ancient warrior, Alexander the Great.

Not-so-good news for those in Kentucky: In the Bluegrass State, 14.4 percent of people said they frequently experienced mental distress -- the highest prevalence in the country. Frequent mental distress is defined as having 14 or more mentally unhealthy days during the previous 30-day period. The researchers were surprised that the study, which will be published in the June 2009 issue of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, showed such a broad range in mental distress depending on geographic location. \"The occurrence of frequent mental distress in adults differs much more than expected among the residents of U.S. states and counties,\" said lead researcher Dr. Matthew M.

It may be because residents in some areas of the country are more likely than others to have health conditions such as disability or diabetes, untreated mental conditions like anxiety or depression, high unemployment rates, risky behaviors including cigarette smoking and alcohol abuse, and/or social circumstances such as lower incomes.

An area centered on Kentucky showed high levels of frequent mental distress that remained elevated over time, while in other parts of the country (such as the upper Midwest) low levels of frequent mental distress remained low over time, the study showed. Health.com: Secrets to a stress-free home . Overall, though, frequent mental distress seems to be on the rise. The rate of frequent mental distress increased by at least 1 percentage point in 27 states, and by more than 4 percentage points in Mississippi, Oklahoma, and West Virginia from the first time period to the second time period. \"In some areas, normal or low frequent-mental-distress levels increased over time, implying the introduction of influences that increased levels of frequent mental distress,\" Zack said.

The new state-by-state breakdown of rates of mental distress should have ramifications as the Obama Administration takes on health care reform, said Chuck Holzer, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. \"From a public health standpoint, it's great to be aware of places with high rates of frequent mental distress so we can help make sure that access to care is increasing in those areas,\" he said. Many of the states with high rates of frequent mental distress are struggling economically, as are their residents. As a result, they may not be able to afford health insurance that includes mental health services. \"The big message is that you need to monitor the health and mental health of the country because it will lead to greater equity in mental health services,\" Holzer said. And Zack said, \"Community mental health agencies, social service agencies, and public health agencies in counties where frequent mental distress is increased should recognize that such increases may indicate unmet health and social service needs.\" Enter to win a monthly Room Makeover Giveaway from MyHomeIdeas.com .

    "input": "Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- Egypt's government is considering financial offers made by imprisoned members of former President Hosni Mubarak's regime to resolve cases of corruption and illegal profiteering brought against them, the Egyptian finance minister said this week. If the proposed deals are accepted, the prisoners -- including steel tycoon Ahmed Ezz, former tourism minister Zoheir Garana and former housing minister Ahmed Maghraby -- would be freed without penalties or trials. Ezz was sentenced to 10 years in prison in September for corruption and fined the equivalent of about $11 million. Garana's lawyers have appealed his five-year prison sentence on corruption and embezzlement charges based on the country's amended investment law. Maghraby was sentenced to five years in prison in May for an illegal land deal. The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, Egypt's ruling military council, amended the country's investment law on January 3, 2012, two weeks before the first session of parliament. The amendment allows the suspects in graft, embezzlement and corruption cases to pay back the amount of illegal finances noted in the case at the time the crime was committed using assets, real estate, cash, or land as a way of reconciliation in return for dropping the charges. The government is working to locate and retrieve money obtained and \"smuggled\" abroad illegally by officials including Mubarak, his sons and former members of his regime, as well as quantify it, Finance Minister Mumtaz Al Saeed said in a news conference. \"We are pursing the money through judicial channels and by governmental efforts as we have requested from many countries the retrieval of funds, but these issues take time and legal procedures must be followed,\" he said. The United Arab Emirates and Switzerland are two of the countries that have received the money, according to Al Saeed. Prime Minister Kamal Al Ganzoury leads a committee in charge of retrieving the money, believed to be in the billions. The government has not accepted the offers made by the former Mubarak officials, and the issue is still being studied by the government, Al Saeed said after meeting with Al Ganzoury. The amendment to the investment law infuriated the Egyptian people, including lawyers and Islamists dominating the parliament. Khaled Abu Bakr, a civil rights lawyer, was among several attorneys submitting a memo to Egypt's general prosecutor and the parliament calling for a review of the law. \"I am totally against this law issued by a military decree days before parliament is convened and I have officially requested an immediate freeze to the negotiations,\" Abu Bakr told CNN. \"If the government accepts then the suspect is immediately freed with no trial or penalties.\" Both the Muslim Brotherhood's Freedom and Justice Party and the Salafi-led Nour Party, which holds a majority of parliament seats, also issued statements opposing the release of former Mubarak officials under the amendment. Activist Hala Mahmoud considers the law a farce and accuses the ruling Supreme Council of orchestrating new laws to their benefit. \"I am sure members of the ruling council have mutual interests with those thieves behind bars, so they came up with this decree that defies the constitution to save themselves,\" Mahmoud said. \"If it passes, then why don't they allow drug dealers to do the same? How is that different?\"",

    "input": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- After about 30 hours of deliberation, a jury on Monday convicted music producer Phil Spector of second-degree murder in the death of actress Lana Clarkson more than six years ago. Phil Spector will not remain free on bail pending his May 29 sentencing. Wearing a black suit with a red tie and pocket square, Spector showed no reaction as the verdict was announced. Now 69, he faces a sentence of 18 years to life in prison when he is sentenced May 29. Asked if he agreed to the sentencing date, Spector quietly answered, \"Yes.\" Prosecutor Alan Jackson said he believed the jury reached the correct verdict, and he acknowledged the strength and backing of Clarkson's family. But defense attorney Doron Weinberg said Spector's defense team disagreed and planned to appeal. \"We don't believe justice was done,\" Weinberg said. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler declined to allow Spector to remain free on bail pending sentencing, citing Spector's years-long \"pattern of violence\" involving firearms.  Watch the lawyers give their views of the verdict Â» . \"This was not an isolated incident,\" Fidler said, noting Spector's two previous firearm-related convictions from the 1970s. \"The taking of an innocent human life, it doesn't get any more serious than that.\" Spector's wife, Rachelle, was in the courtroom to hear the verdict Monday, as was Clarkson's mother, Donna. Clarkson, 40, was found dead, slumped in a chair in the foyer of Spector's Alhambra, California, mansion with a gunshot wound through the roof of her mouth in February 2003. A mistrial was declared in Spector's first trial in September 2007. After deliberating 15 days, jurors told Fidler that they were unable to reach a verdict. Spector was also charged with second-degree murder in that trial. Jurors deadlocked 10-2 in favor of conviction. In closing arguments at the retrial, prosecutor Truc Do called Spector \"a very dangerous man\" who \"has a history of playing Russian roulette with women -- six women. Lana just happened to be the sixth.\" Weinberg argued that the prosecution's case hinged on circumstantial evidence. He said the possibility that Clarkson committed suicide could not be ruled out. Do pointed out, however, to jurors that Clarkson bought new shoes on the day of her death -- something a suicidal woman would not have done, the prosecutor said. A female juror who declined to be identified told reporters the jurors considered all the evidence and testimony to reach their verdict. \"This entire jury took this so seriously,\" she said with tears in her eyes, before adding that \"it's tough to be in a jury,\" because another person's life is in the jury's hands. Clarkson starred in the 1985 B-movie \"Barbarian Queen\" and appeared in many other films, including \"DeathStalker,\" \"Blind Date,\" \"Scarface,\" \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" and the spoof \"Amazon Women on the Moon.\" She was working as a VIP hostess at Hollywood's House of Blues at the time of her death. In the 2007 trial, Spector's attorneys argued that Clarkson was depressed over a recent breakup and grabbed a .38-caliber pistol to kill herself while at Spector's home. But prosecution witnesses painted Spector as a gun-toting menace. Five women took the stand and claimed he had threatened them with firearms. His driver testified that he heard a loud noise and saw the producer leave the home, pistol in hand, saying, \"I think I killed somebody.\" Spector's retrial began in October. Fidler ruled that jurors could consider the lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter against Spector. Spector's professional trademark was the \"Wall of Sound,\" the layering of instrumental tracks and percussion that underpinned a string of hits on his Philles label -- named for Spector and his business partner, Lester Sill -- in the early 1960s. iReport.com: What do you think of this verdict? The roaring arrangements were the heart of what he called \"little symphonies for the kids\" -- among them No. 1 hits like the Ronettes' \"Be My Baby\" and the Righteous Brothers' \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'.\" Spector co-produced the Beatles' final album, \"Let It Be,\" and worked with ex-Beatles George Harrison and John Lennon on solo projects after the group broke up. His recording of Harrison's 1971 benefit concert for war relief in Bangladesh won the 1972 Grammy award for album of the year. Spector has won two Grammy Awards and was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1989, but he stayed out of the public eye for two decades before his 2003 arrest in Clarkson's death.",

    "input": "Singapore (CNN) -- U.S. President Barack Obama, on his first Asia trip since taking office in January, arrived Saturday in Singapore to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum. In addition to the meetings with the APEC heads of state, Obama planned to hold three bilateral meetings -- with the leaders of Russia, Indonesia and Singapore. APEC's 21 member nations represent more than half of the world's economic output. The forum sees its goal as \"facilitating economic growth, cooperation, trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region.\" Obama will become the first U.S. president to take part in a summit of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) economic alliance. The formal meeting is Sunday. Earlier Saturday, Obama told a packed house at Tokyo's Suntory Hall that all Americans should know that what happens in Asia \"has a direct effect on our lives at home.\" The president leaves Sunday for Shanghai, China. The trip, which lasts more than a week, is Obama's first to Asia since taking office in January. In his Tokyo speech, Obama touted himself as America's \"first Pacific president,\" and pledged a renewed engagement with Asia Pacific nations based on \"an enduring and revitalized alliance between the United States and Japan.\" He touched on nearly every part of the Asia Pacific region during his speech, and talked about a boyhood visit to Japan with his mother, his birth in Hawaii, a childhood spent partly in Indonesia and the United States' position as a Pacific nation. \"There must be no doubt: as America's first Pacific president, I promise you that this Pacific nation will strengthen and sustain our leadership in this vitally important part of the world,\" he said. He emphasized that the United States was not interested in containing the emerging economic growth in China. Obama also called on Myanmar to make more definitive moves toward democracy, including releasing all political prisoners. He urged North Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks so the reclusive nation can be reintegrated into the world stage and pledged America's support for eliminating nuclear weapons and efforts to reduce the global effects of climate change. In China, Obama will continue efforts to define and strengthen the United States' relationship with the world's largest emerging economy, which has a growing influence in Asia, said Jeffrey Bader, the National Security Council's senior director for East Asian affairs. Bader cited North Korea's nuclear weapons program, the economy, climate change, human rights and Afghanistan as among the top issues for the China swing. On human rights, Bader said Obama is likely to address \"freedom of expression, access to information, freedom of religion, rule of law and, certainly, Tibet.\" Obama will make clear to Chinese President Hu Jintao that he intends to meet with the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, Bader said. China, which rejects Tibetan aspirations for autonomy, opposes such high-level contacts with the Dalai Lama.",

    "input": "London (CNN) -- An increasingly bitter dispute between the United Kingdom and Iceland over billions of dollars lost when banks collapsed is likely to end up in court, a top British government minister said Sunday. The British government has \"an obligation to get that money back, and we will continue to pursue that until we do,\" said Danny Alexander, the chief secretary of the Treasury. He was speaking Sunday after Iceland's people voted to repeal a law aimed at solving the dispute. Six out of 10 voters in the referendum on Saturday opposed the law, the government said in a statement Sunday, saying turnout was high. Alexander called Saturday's Icelandic vote \"disappointing,\" adding, \"We have a very difficult financial position as a country ... This money would help.\" \"There is a legal process going on and we will carry on through these processes,\" he said on the BBC's \"Andrew Marr\" show. The battle results from the collapse of an Icelandic internet bank in October 2008. Britain and the Netherlands came up with more than $5 billion to bail out savers in their own countries who lost money in the failure of Icesave -- an online retail bank branch of Landsbanki. They are now trying to claim the money back from Iceland. Some payments will go ahead later this year, Iceland's government said Sunday, explaining that they were not affected by the vote. \"These partial payments are expected to cover close to a third of priority (depositor) claims. Moreover, latest figures on its assets indicate that the estate (of Landsbanki) will be able to pay over 90% of claims for deposits,\" the government said in a statement. Under a European Union directive, Iceland owes compensation to Britain and the Netherlands. The Icelandic government has said it will honor its international obligations. Netherlands Finance Minister Jan Kees de Jager is \"very disappointed about the decision of the Icelandic electorate not to agree with the agreement reached between Iceland, the U.K. and the Netherlands,\" the Netherlands Finance Ministry said in a statement Sunday. \"The time for negotiations is over,\" de Jager said in the statement. \"Iceland remains obliged to repay. The issue is now for the courts to decide.\" The Netherlands Finance Ministry said it is consulting with the United Kingdom about further steps. The International Monetary Fund loaned Iceland $2.1 billion in November 2009, and said repaying the money to the British and Dutch governments was a requirement of the loan. Iceland has begun moves toward applying for European Union membership, which Britain and the Netherlands could block. CNN's Bharati Naik contributed to this report.",

    "input": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- A hearing is set for Monday in a case involving actress Lindsay Lohan after an arrest warrant was issued for her Friday, officials said. A warrant issued for Lindsay Lohan apparently stems from her 2007 drunken driving convictions, police said. Lohan's attorney told CNN the warrant was issued \"out of a misunderstanding.\" It was not known whether she would attend the hearing Monday. The warrant was issued by a Los Angeles Superior Court judge in Beverly Hills, California. It apparently stems from Lohan's 2007 convictions for drunken driving, police said Friday. She is serving three years probation. Sandi Gibbons of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office told CNN on Sunday the warrant is believed to be in connection with a possible probation violation. The district attorney's office prosecuted the original 2007 case, she said. The hearing is set to begin sometime after 8:30 a.m., she said. Lohan \"has the right to appear\" at the hearing, said Alan Parachini, Los Angeles Superior Court spokesman. \"That decision is up to her.\" Lohan's attorney, Shawn Chapman Holley, told CNN on Sunday that she will appear at the hearing on Lohan's behalf. \"Since her case was resolved, Ms. Lohan has been in compliance with all the terms and conditions of her probation and all orders of the court,\" Holley said in a statement. \"The warrant issued on Friday was, in our view, born out of a misunderstanding which I am confident I can clear up next week,\" Holley said. Police said Saturday they were not actively seeking Lohan, as they would not usually go after a person to take them into custody in such cases. Beverly Hills police Sgt. Mike Foxen said on Friday authorities were hoping Lohan would turn herself in. Lohan was arrested twice in 2007 on driving under the influence charges, with a cocaine possession charge in the second incident. The first arrest, in May 2007, came after Lohan lost control of her Mercedes-Benz convertible and struck a curb in Beverly Hills. Just two weeks after checking out of a Malibu drug and alcohol rehab facility, she was arrested again in July 2007 after a woman called Santa Monica police saying Lohan was trying to run her down in a car. A judge sentenced Lohan to three years probation after she entered guilty and no contest pleas to the charges. Lohan's acting career, which started at age 10 on a soap opera, took off on the big screen a year later when she played both identical twins in Disney's \"The Parent Trap.\" Since then, she has starred in at least a dozen movies, including \"Georgia Rule\" with Jane Fonda in 2007. Her pop music recording career, boosted by her movie roles, has floundered in the past year. Her last album was released in 2005. CNN's Irving Last contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- People arrested amid unrest in Syria are being subjected to systematic torture, including electric shocks, beatings and sexual violence, a report by rights group Amnesty International said Wednesday. Based on interviews in Jordan with dozens of Syrians who have fled the country, the report details \"31 methods of torture or other ill treatment\" at the hands of the security forces, army and pro-government armed gangs. This Thursday marks a year since unrest first broke out, prompting a bloody crackdown and massive wave of arrests by the Syrian authorities. The government says it is battling \"armed terrorist groups\" but international leaders and rights groups dispute that. The torture meted out to those arrested on suspicion of opposing the government has generally followed a set pattern, says the Amnesty International report, titled \"'I wanted to die': Syria's torture survivors speak out.\" Many detainees say they were beaten on arrest, and then subjected to severe beatings on arrival at detention centers. But their accounts show the greatest risk of abuse came when they were interrogated, the report says. Several detainees describe being forced into a vehicle tire and then beaten with cables or sticks, the report says. Others tell of being suspended above the ground by their wrists and then beaten, and of being forced to strip naked, often for long periods in extreme cold. An 18-year-old victim named as \"Karim\" told researchers that his interrogators used pincers to gouge flesh from his legs while he was held for 25 days in Daraa in December. Another man, a 29-year-old Arabic language teacher identified as \"Musleh,\" also described horrific treatment while being held in Daraa. \"We were hung from wood -- crucified -- while blindfolded and handcuffed, and then beaten mercilessly and repeatedly between 9 a.m. to 7 p.m.,\" he told the Amnesty researchers. Detainees also were forced to witness abuse and hear others -- sometimes relatives or friends -- being tortured and raped, the report says. \"I heard the screams of those being tortured for 24 hours a day. While in the cell we were busy praying for the safety of those who are being tortured,\" Musleh is quoted as saying. The accounts reveal \"a nightmarish world of systematic torture,\" said Ann Harrison, interim deputy director for Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa program. \"The testimonies we have heard give disturbing insights into a system of detention and interrogation which, a year after protests began, appears intended primarily to degrade, humiliate and terrify its victims into silence,\" she said. She said the experience for detainees arrested over the past year is similar to that endured under former President Hafez Assad, father of the current leader, Bashar al-Assad. Researchers spoke with dozens of Syrians in Jordan, including 25 who said they were tortured or ill-treated in detention before fleeing the country, an Amnesty press statement says. More than half the 19 cases featured in the report are from Daraa province, it adds. The abuses are being routinely carried out despite Syria being a party to the Convention against Torture and other international agreements, the report says, and the Syrian authorities \"appear to have no desire to try to stamp out these grave human rights violations.\" The rights group urges Syria to take \"urgent measures\" to prevent further crimes under international law, including ending the arbitrary arrest and detention of those protesting peacefully against the government and halting the systemic use of torture. It also calls on the international community to take on responsibility for protecting the human rights of the Syrian people and ensuring violations are investigated and prosecuted. International leaders should also assist humanitarian agencies, rights groups and non-governmental organizations in helping the survivors of torture and their families, particularly in cases of sexual violence. Lastly, the report urges the U.N. Security Council to act by referring the situation to the International Criminal Court for investigation, imposing a comprehensive arms embargo and freezing the assets of al-Assad and his associates. Russia and China vetoed a Security Council resolution last month that many other countries argued could have helped stop the violence. The resolution would have condemned al-Assad and called on him to step aside. More than 8,000 people have been killed in the Syrian conflict, including many women and children, Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, current president of the U.N. General Assembly, said Tuesday. Opposition activists have put the toll at more than 9,000. About 30,000 Syrians have fled to neighboring countries in the past year, according to Panos Moumtzis, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' coordinator for Syrian refugees. CNN cannot independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in Syria because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists. But most reports from inside Syria indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking al-Assad's ouster. The al-Assad family has ruled Syria for more than four decades. Members of the Syrian security forces are also among those killed as the initially peaceful protests have spiraled into widespread violence. CNN's Bruce Conover contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A children's show host who was born with one hand is facing criticism from parents over her disability. The BBC is receiving complaints about kids' show host Cerrie Burnell, who was born with one hand. BBC spokeswoman Katya Mira said the corporation has received at least 25 \"official\" complaints recently about Cerrie Burnell, new host of two shows on the BBC-run CBeebies television network, which is aimed at children younger than 6. The official complaints do not count the dozens of negative comments lodged in Internet chat rooms, Mira said. In one chat room, a father lamented that Burnell being on the show forced him to have conversations with his child about disabilities. However, there have also been messages of support for Burnell. What do you think about the complaints? \"We have also received 99 appreciations of her,\" Mira said. Burnell started as a presenter of the shows in late January after acting with theater companies in Manchester, England, and Brazil. A BBC news release in January introducing Burnell made no mention of her disability, but a publicity photo showed the right sleeve of her sweater pulled up, showing her arm stops just below her elbow. The issue has spurred a debate in England among newspapers, columnists and bloggers. Burnell said she has heard the criticism and will not let it bother her. 'It can only be a good thing that parents are using me as a chance to talk disability with their children. It just goes to show how important it is to have positive, disabled role models on CBeebies and television in general,\" Burnell said. Michael Carrington, BBC controller of CBeebies, said the company is standing by Burnell. \"Cerrie is warm and natural and we think that, in time, all moms and dads and children will love her as much as we do,\" Carrington said.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The Arab League's decision to impose sweeping sanctions on Syria, a move followed by Turkey, reflects an unprecedented level of collective action by the historically moribund regional body. The Sunday vote by 19 Arab states to punish Syria further isolates Damascus and undermines President Bashar al-Assad's self-proclaimed role as the dominant voice of Arab nationalism. Indeed, the activist role adopted by the Arab League as the 2011 Arab uprisings unfold has been a surprising development: Following decades of issuing lowest common denominator communiques, the league is rapidly emerging as a key regional actor. The Arab League's strong condemnation last spring of Moammar Gadhafi's brutality easily could have been dismissed as a one-off, given the Libyan strongman's success at enraging most Arab leaders over the years. Yet by following up its suspension of Syria from the organization with tough sanctions, it's clear the Arab League is taking on a more muscular role in the unfolding regional drama. There are four main reasons for this new Arab League approach: . First and foremost: The Arab uprisings themselves. If nothing else, the protests of 2011 brought the power of Arab public opinion front and center. Gone are the days when Arab leaders could act with total disregard for their people's opinions. Public opinion throughout the Arab world resoundingly disapproved of Gadhafi's behavior, and now of Assad's. This sentiment is motivating Arab leaders to respond to their people's anger, through the Arab League. The corollary to this is Arab leaders' fear that if they stand idly by while Assad slaughters Syrians, popular resentment could boomerang against them. Whereas popular discontent was traditionally channeled toward Israel and the West, collective Arab opprobrium is now targeted at brutal Arab regimes. If they fail to act, many Arab leaders could suffer political heartache and more popular unrest at home. Getting ahead of this demonstrates that they respond to public opinion, and it helps deflect popular discontent away from domestic issues. On the geo-strategic level, Arab League activism is motivated by a desire to keep the Arabs in the drivers' seat. With the United States largely over the horizon, Arab docility only creates windows of opportunity for non-Arabs to muck about in Middle East diplomacy. Turkey has not succeeded in creating a leading diplomatic role for itself in the region, despite efforts to play an active role in Libya, Yemen and other hot spots. The Arabs want to ensure that this remains the case. Hence, Ankara was relegated to supporting the measures adopted by the Arab League, not initiating them. The other geo-strategic explanation for Arab League activism is Iran. The Arabs, particularly the Gulf states, have long decried Iran's encroachment in Syria, Lebanon, and the Palestinian territories. Isolating Iran's key strategic ally in the region -- Assad's Syria -- provides a significant opportunity to roll back some of Tehran's regional gains. Already, Hamas' Damascus-based leadership is looking for a new home and behaving with greater restraint. And when Iran was seen to be meddling in Bahrain's sectarian struggle earlier this year, the Gulf states brutally crushed it -- collectively. With the United States withdrawing from an Iraq they see as now heavily influenced by Iran, the other Arab states have even greater incentive to band together. In taking strong actions, the Arab League claims to want to stave off foreign intervention in Syria. Qatar's Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim hinted at this when he said that he \"hoped\" the Arab League's sanctions would obviate the need for foreign intervention. In the short term, a more active Arab role may indeed make non-Arab nations hesitate to get involved -- but as was the case in Libya, the Arab League might actually be providing the necessary regional legitimacy for outside intervention. This Arab League activism may signal a new regional norm analogous to the United Nations' \"responsibility to protect.\" The Arab League has effectively joined the international rejection of the three-century old Westphalian system that enshrined the nonintervention of one state in the domestic affairs of another state. Arab leaders can no longer turn a blind eye to the abhorrent behavior of fellow Arab rulers. This is a welcome development, one that could head off other foreign interventions in the Middle East and encourage further collective action against brutal acts some Arab leaders perpetrate against their own people.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Sen. Barack Obama's choice for running mate will be announced to supporters in a text message Saturday morning, senior Obama campaign officials told CNN on Friday night, and a senior party official said it won't be Sen. Hillary Clinton. Sen. Barack Obama says he has decided on his running mate but is not yet ready to reveal the name. Obama called some people on his short list for the vice presidential slot Thursday night to tell them he had not selected them as a running mate, a highly placed Democratic Party source said. A senior Democratic official who had spoken with Clinton told CNN late Friday that the Obama campaign has communicated to her through private channels that she will not be Obama's vice presidential pick. Also, sources close to Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine said he has been informed he was not selected. One source told CNN that Obama personally made the call to Kaine. Another source said Kaine has flown to Denver, Colorado, for the Democratic National Convention. See who's in the running . It is not known who else may have gotten calls. However, late Friday two Democratic sources confirmed that Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh is also out of the running. Most of this week's buzz had been around Bayh of Indiana, Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware and Kaine. The contenders kept a low profile and Biden has avoided any lengthy interviews. Rep. Chet Edwards said Friday that the campaign had vetted him but that he hasn't talked to Obama.  Watch panelists weigh in on top VP contenders Â» . Edwards, 56, is a nine-term congressman representing the Central Texas district that includes President Bush's ranch near Crawford. This month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi touted Edwards as a dark horse contender for the No. 2 spot on the ticket. The presumptive Democratic nominee was working Friday in Chicago, Illinois, on his address for the convention. He will launch a string of rallies with his running mate on Saturday in Springfield, Illinois. Obama said Thursday that he had made his decision but declined to give further details. \"I won't comment on anything else until I introduce our running mate to the world,\" Obama said in Emporia, Virginia. \"That's all you're going to get out of me.\" Watch Obama say he's made his choice Â» . Clinton re-entered the running mate conversation this week after a poll indicating that nearly half of her supporters have yet to embrace Obama. The Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll out Wednesday night said 52 percent of Clinton supporters said they will vote for Obama. Twenty-one percent favor Republican Sen. John McCain, while 27 percent are undecided or say they will vote for \"someone else.'' The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points. The former first lady was considered one of the top VP contenders shortly after she ended her White House run in June, but rumors of lingering tension between the former rivals and word that her name would be placed in nomination at the convention are partially to blame for political observers kicking her out of the top tier. Other big names thought to be in the running included retired Gen. Wesley Clark, Sen. Chris Dodd of Connecticut, Sen. Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, former Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson and Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius. CNN's Jessica Yellin, Candy Crowley, John King and Ed Henry contributed to this report.",

    "input": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Smoking in youth-rated movies has not declined despite a pledge two years ago by Hollywood studios to encourage producers to show less \"gratuitous smoking,\" according to an anti-smoking group. The American Medical Association Alliance has been trying to get movie studios to make smoking-free films. The American Medical Association Alliance, pointing to research that big-screen smoking leads teens to pick up the tobacco habit, called for an R rating for any movie with smoking scenes. The head of the group that gives U.S. movies their ratings, however, said the smoke has been clearing from youth-rated movies, a result of the film industry's sensitivity to the issue. The alliance, the medical association's advocacy arm, launched a summer campaign this week aimed at publicly shaming studios into making smoke-free films. \"Research has shown that one-third to one-half of all young smokers in the United States can be attributed to smoking these youth see in movies,\" said Dr. Jonathan Fielding, head of the Los Angeles County Public Health Department. Fielding cited another study that he said \"found that adolescents whose favorite movie stars smoked on screen are significantly more likely to be smokers themselves and to have a more accepting attitude toward smoking.\" The Motion Picture Association of America, the industry group that issues ratings and parental guidance for U.S. films, added smoking scenes as a factor in ratings two years ago, but Fielding said it has not made a difference. \"In all, 56 percent of the top box office movies with smoking released between May 2007 and May 2009 were youth-rated films -- G, PG or PG-13,\" he said. Joan Graves, who chairs the Motion Picture Association's movie rating committee, offered her own statistics, based on all of the 900 films rated each year, not just the top movies included in Fielding's numbers. The association has given no G ratings in the past two years to a movie with smoking, Graves said. Overall, 55 percent of the  movies rated in the past two years showed some smoking, but 75 percent of those with smoking scenes were given R ratings, Graves said. Twenty-one percent were rated PG-13 and the remaining 5 percent were PG, she said. A G movie is deemed suitable for all audiences, while a PG rating is a signal to parents that a film may include some material they might consider inappropriate for children. PG-13 indicates a stronger warning that some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. No one under 17 can be admitted to see an R movie without a parent or guardian. American Medical Association Alliance President Sandi Frost used as her chief example of a movie with \"gratuitous smoking\" this month's blockbuster \"X-Men Origins: Wolverine,\" which was rated PG-13 \"for intense sequences of action and violence, and some partial nudity.\" \"Millions of children have been exposed to the main star of the film, Hugh Jackman, with a cigar in his mouth in various scenes,\" Frost said. \"I'm willing to bet that not one child would have enjoyed that movie or Mr. Jackman's performance any less if he hadn't been smoking.\" A spokesman for Twentieth Century Fox, the studio responsible for the Wolverine movie series, said Jackman's cigar was never lit and it was limited to just two scenes. In one scene, the cigar is shot out of his mouth, prompting Jackman's Wolverine character to suggest its loss would lead to clean living -- an anti-smoking statement -- the studio spokesman said. He said that while the Wolverine character has a cigar in his mouth in almost every panel of the comic book series, producers made \"a conscious decision\" to limit the cigar in the movie. The American Medical Association Alliance, hoping to draw studio executives' attention, hired a mobile billboard to drive around the major studios this week. \"The billboard shows a teenage girl asking the question, 'Which movie studios will cause me to smoke this summer?' \" Frost said. The alliance will keep an online scorecard throughout the summer to count \"how many tobacco impressions each studio delivers to G, PG and PG-13 audiences,\" she said. \"At the end of the summer, whichever studio has delivered the most tobacco impressions to youth audiences will be named in a billboard that will run outside of their headquarters,\" she said. Motion Picture Association of America spokeswoman Angela Martinez said the group \"is very sensitive to the concerns of parents about the purpose of the rating systems.\" \"It's reflective of society,\" Martinez said. \"It's really a tool for parents to help determine what their kids see.\" They began factoring smoking scenes into the ratings two years ago as \"a reflection of changes in society and health concerns,\" she said. \"Smoking is rated like all the other factors, including violence and sex,\" she said. Fielding said it should be absolute -- and not just a factor. \"Any movie with smoking should be rated R,\" he said. \"And if they worry about an R rating hurting their profits, then they should work with studios to remove smoking from films that hurt youth.\" Graves, whose committee makes the decisions, indicated such a zero-tolerance policy would not be accepted.",

The 31-year-old opener had moved from his overnight score of 284 to 293 before he chipped a flighted delivery from Muttiah Muralitharan back to the bowler who claimed the catch at the second attempt. \"I am very happy I got at least 293 runs -- I am proud of what I have achieved,\" Sehwag told reporters at the close of the third day's play. \"Not many people have got two triple centuries and followed that with 293. So there is nothing to be disappointed about. \"I tried to take my time, but maybe the ball was not there to be hit.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Sonia, a single mother with HIV in Brazil, travels four hours to reach a government-run health facility that provides her with free drug treatment. Brazil's response to the HIV/AIDS fight has been widely praised and adopted as a model around the world. The journey is long, she told CNN, but it's a small price to pay for the government-provided drugs that have helped keep her out of the hospital for the past 11 years. Sonia is just one of the many Brazilians who have benefited from the country's novel approach to fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Brazil jolted the global health community in 1996 when it began guaranteeing free anti-retroviral treatment to HIV/AIDS patients. For Sonia, government-funded treatment comes in the form of 20 pills. Taken daily, the anti-retroviral medicine has helped keep her HIV at bay. Coupled with government-supported prevention efforts and aggressive public awareness campaigns, the so-called Brazilian response has been hailed as a model for developing countries. Watch a report on Brazil's pioneering response to HIV/AIDS Â» . Prevention campaigns, which often take the forms of candid public awareness ads with slogans like \"Be good in bed, use a condom,\" have resulted in widespread knowledge of HIV. According to a recent study conducted by the country's Ministry of Health, Brazil boasts one of the highest rates of knowledge globally when it comes to HIV avoidance and transmittal. Brazil was \"the first country to realize there is no separation between prevention and treatment,\" Mauro Schechter, professor of infectious diseases at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, told CNN. Schechter, who has studied the HIV/AIDS epidemic since 1989, said it took the rest of the global health community some 15 years to realize that the two go hand-in-hand. Other countries that have adopted the Brazilian model Â» . The comprehensive response has extended the lives of tens of thousands of Brazilians and saved the government billions, researchers estimate. A recent study published by researchers from Brown University and the Harvard School of Public Health said that Brazil has saved $1 billion alone by producing its own generic versions of HIV/AIDS medicines and negotiating discounts for imported drugs. Those drug savings come on top of the estimated $2 billion the program has saved Brazil in hospital costs between 1996 and 2004. Brazil's efforts to reverse the tide of the AIDS epidemic have become the object of admiration in the global health community, but the trailblazer is encountering new challenges. When Brazil decided to guarantee free anti-retrovirals, there were 10,000 people being treated and it was organized as a program to treat a small amount of people for a limited amount of time, according to Schechter. Patients are living longer and oftentimes able to get their disease under control, thanks to combination therapies, better known as drug cocktails. But that means they also require drug treatment for a longer period of time. Furthermore, as HIV has evolved from an acute illness into a chronic disease, patients have also become vulnerable to other health risks and medical conditions. Valdileia Veloso is the director of the Institute of Clinical Research at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation, a public health research institution in Rio de Janeiro. She told CNN patients are presenting with complications of chronic HIV and AIDS, which requires new treatment. \"It's a new challenge for us,\" she said. Heart disease is one of the big problems that doctors are encountering. While there's a system in place to prevent people from dying from HIV, preventable causes like heart conditions are causing deaths. \"These people are dying from preventable causes,\" Schechter told CNN. While Brazil has shown that providing universal access to treatment can be achieved, it needs to modify its approach to treat the evolving disease, he said. \"If the epidemic changes face, you need to adapt.\"",

The roommate, Tyler Clementi, committed suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge just days after Dharun Ravi allegedly streamed the encounter remotely and allowed others to view it. \"That viewing lasted, depending upon who you want to listen to, two to five seconds,\" said defense attorney Steven Altman. \"The back of two people from the corner of the room, embracing. ... That was it.\" Ravi, 19, faces a 15-count indictment in connection with Clementi's 2010 death that includes charges of invasion of privacy, bias intimidation, tampering with physical evidence, witness tampering, and hindering apprehension or prosecution. The jury will be confronted with the question of whether Ravi's alleged bullying was borne of a gay prejudice that prompted him to intimidate Clementi because of his sexual orientation. \"These acts were purposeful, they were intentional, and they were planned,\" prosecutor Julia L. McClure told the jury on the first day of the trial. The highly anticipated case drew more than 100 people inside the courtroom. Last year, Ravi turned down a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail time. The deal offered by Middlesex County prosecutors would have required the former student to undergo 600 hours of community service, counseling and to dispose of any information that could identify the man that appeared in the web video with Clementi. Prosecutors also offered to help Ravi avoid deportation, though they said they could not guarantee it. Ravi is a citizen of India who had been studying on a visa at the New Jersey university. A second student charged in the scandal, Molly Wei, 19, reached a plea deal that requires her to testify against Ravi. If convicted, Ravi could face up to 10 years behind bars. On Friday, Wei's roommate Cassandra Cicco testified about the alleged video stream. \"I could only really see one of them and his back was to the camera and he appeared to be shirtless,\" she said. \"Someone pressed end on the feed. It ended abruptly and we were all just like -- oh, OK, that happened. And that was the end of it.\" Less than a month after Clementi's suicide, President Barack Obama released a taped video message condemning bullying.",

Those attending Jessica Ghawi's memorial service Saturday at a San Antonio church heard numerous adjectives describing the hockey fan and aspiring sports broadcaster. \"Spitfire.\" \"Spunky.\" \"Clumsy.\" \"Tough.\" The descriptions punctuated a service that lauded the life of a woman killed while in pursuit of her dreams. Ghawi was among the 12 killed in the July 20 mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado. Dozens of others were wounded. Her service was one of four held Saturday for victims of the massacre. Matt McQuinn was remembered in Springfield, Ohio; Alex Teves was honored in Phoenix; while a private funeral was held in Illinois for John T. Larimer. Remembering the victims through photos, memories . Ghawi's family created the Jessica Redfield Sports Journalism Scholarship Fund in her name to help others who dream of pursuing careers in journalism. Ghawi, 24, went by the name Jessica Redfield on-air. Several speakers humorously recalled when Ghawi, as an intern wearing high heels, fell three times on the ice while interviewing members of the San Antonio Rampage hockey club. A video of the falls was shown at the service. Pastor Robert Emmitt of Community Bible Church said Ghawi -- despite the pain and embarrassment -- got back up. He called her a \"strong-willed child.\" The victim's brother, Jordan Ghawi, referring first to the suspect in the Colorado shooting, had two messages for the audience. \"If this coward could have done this with this much hate, imagine what we can do with this much love,\" he said. \"If you are putting your dreams on hold, you stop that right now. You chase those dreams. You don't know how long you have here.\" Mom who lost daughter in shooting has miscarriage . Jessica Ghawi, who moved to the Denver area to pursue her career, narrowly avoided another shooting incident in Toronto just last month -- an incident that prompted her to reflect on life on her blog. The Toronto shooting at the Eaton Centre left one person dead and seven injured. \"I was shown how fragile life was on Saturday. I saw the terror on bystanders' faces. I saw the victims of a senseless crime. I saw lives change,\" she wrote at the time. \"I was reminded that we don't know when or where our time on Earth will end. When or where we will breathe our last breath.\" The young woman's boyfriend, minor league hockey player Jay Meloff, said, \"She drank in life and celebrated the things that made us uniquely us.\" Tales of heroism abound from Colorado movie theater tragedy . In Ohio, McQuinn's family is still trying to make sense of his heroic death. McQuinn, 27, died shielding his girlfriend, Samantha Yowler, during the shooting. She attended Saturday's memorial service, where Quinn's portrait sat near rows of flowers in the front of Maiden Lane Church of God in Springfield. Herb Shaffer said during the service that his nephew's core goodness and selflessness came out during that midnight showing of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in Aurora. \"In a moment of crisis, you don't have time to think about what you're going to do, all you have time is to react,\" said Shaffer, who is also a pastor. \"And we saw a picture of Matt in that moment of crisis. ... His immediate response was to protect the one that he loved.\" Alex Teves, 24, also died while protecting his girlfriend, Amanda Lindgren. More than a week later, his friends and family gathered in Phoenix to remember his spirit and life. Attendees, including Teves' parents, attended the memorial service in white T-shirts and blue jeans, just as Teves routinely did while in high school and beyond. Teves graduated in June with a master's degree in counseling psychology from the University of Denver. \"He wasn't very vain, he was more interested in relationships,\" his father, Tom Teves, told reporters Saturday before entering Corpus Christi Catholic Church for the service. \"... He put people first, always.\" About 1,700 miles away in Crystal Lake, Illinois, Larimer received full military honors at his funeral. The Navy petty officer 3rd class had been in the military for about one year. Like his father and grandfather, the 27-year-old Larimer chose to join the U.S. Navy. He was serving at his first post, said his father, Scott Larimer. Meanwhile, a court document filed Friday showed suspect James Holmes was a patient of a University of Colorado psychiatrist before last week's attack at a movie theater that killed 12 people and wounded scores. The disclosure was in a request by Holmes for authorities to immediately hand over a package he sent to Dr. Lynne Fenton at the university's Anschutz Medical Campus. According to Holmes' request, the package seized by authorities under a July 23 search warrant was a protected communication. \"The materials contained in that package include communications from Mr. Holmes to Dr. Fenton that Mr. Holmes asserts are privileged,\" said the document filed by public defenders representing Holmes. \"Mr. Holmes was a psychiatric patient of Dr. Fenton, and his communications with her are protected.\" Victims remembered with poignant stories . In response, prosecutors asked for Arapahoe County District Judge William Sylvester to deny the request by Holmes, saying it contained inaccuracies including claims of media leaks by government officials that in reality may have been fabricated by news organizations. Sylvester granted a hearing on the request for Monday, the same day that Holmes is scheduled to be formally charged in the case. Eleven wounded survivors remained hospitalized Saturday at three facilities, including five in critical condition. One of them, Ashley Moser, underwent \"an additional surgery\" on Saturday morning and also suffered a miscarriage due to \"the extreme trauma she sustained,\" her family said in a statement.

    "input": "NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (CNN) -- The Orleans Parish district attorney said he plans to look into deaths at a New Orleans hospital in the days following Hurricane Katrina, but stopped short of calling it an investigation. Staff at Memorial were accused of hastening four patients' deaths in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. \"My office has not reopened an investigation into the deaths at Memorial hospital\" after Katrina struck the Gulf Coast in 2005, Leon Cannizzaro said in a statement released Friday. \"As district attorney, I have a legal obligation to evaluate statements regarding possible criminal activity in this jurisdiction,\" the statement said. \"I am making that kind of evaluation, but that does not constitute an investigation by this office.\" The New Orleans Times-Picayune reported in a story Saturday that Cannizzaro will interview New Orleans coroner Frank Minyard and possibly other pathologists on the coroner's staff regarding the deaths of Memorial Medical Center patients. But the newspaper quoted Cannizzaro as saying an investigation would involve convening a grand jury and bringing in witnesses to testify, and he does not at this time have plans to do that. After speaking with the coroner, the district attorney said he would decide whether a more in-depth investigation is necessary. Cannizzaro's spokesman, Christopher Bowman, said Monday the DA's office had no further comment beyond the Friday statement. According to the Times-Picayune, Cannizzaro's conversation with Minyard was prompted by an article in The New York Times last month that quoted two doctors as saying that they gave Memorial patients morphine and other drugs in the days after the hurricane struck, knowing they would die. Cannizzaro told the newspaper he would be \"remiss in his responsibilities\" if he did not talk to Minyard about information in the article. \"That doesn't mean I am opening an investigation,\" he said. Katrina roared ashore near the Mississippi-Louisiana state line on August 29, 2005, rupturing three of New Orleans' protective levees and putting about three-quarters of the city under water. Then-Louisiana Attorney General Charles Foti Jr. launched an investigation after officials from Lifecare, an acute-care facility operating on the seventh floor of Memorial, reported allegations that several seriously ill, mostly elderly patients had been euthanized by medical staff at Memorial as the floodwater rose around the hospital and conditions inside deteriorated. In 2006, Foti ordered the arrest of Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses, Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, on preliminary charges of second-degree murder in the deaths of four patients. Former Orleans Parish District Attorney Eddie Jordan, who under Louisiana law was responsible for prosecuting crimes, gave Budo and Landry immunity in exchange for their testimony. In July 2007, the grand jury refused to indict Pou. Foti said his investigation revealed that the four patients -- ages 63, 68, 91 and 93 -- were given a \"lethal cocktail\" of morphine and midazolam hydrochloride, both central nervous system depressants. Pou, Landry and Budo all denied the charges, and their attorneys said they acted heroically, staying to treat patients rather than evacuate. In an interview with Newsweek magazine in 2007, Pou admitted giving the patients drugs. \"If in doing so it hastened their deaths, then that's what happened,\" she said. \"But this was not, 'I'm going to go to the seventh floor and murder some people.' We're here to help patients.\" The grand jury never heard testimony from five specialists who advised Foti that the patients were deliberately killed with overdoses of drugs after Katrina struck. All five were brought in by Foti's office to analyze the deaths, and concluded the patients were homicide victims. After the grand jury refused to indict Pou, Jordan called the case closed and said he would no longer pursue it. If Cannizzaro does decide an in-depth investigation is warranted, it could affect the outcome of a lawsuit in which CNN and The Times-Picayune are seeking the release of Foti's investigative file into the deaths. CNN was the first to report the allegations of euthanasia, six weeks after the hurricane. The case went to the Louisiana Supreme Court, which in July sent it back to the trial court to rule on whether criminal litigation in the case is reasonably anticipated, according to Lori Mince, the New Orleans attorney representing the media organizations. A reopened investigation could lead the court to rule that criminal charges may be forthcoming. Hospital workers identified only as John and Jane Doe had sued to block the public release of the file, claiming the records are covered by grand jury secrecy rules, that they should have been considered confidential informants and that releasing the documents would violate their privacy.",

Unlike Gibbs and Pfeiffer, Moran is not already on Obama's communications team. \"These individuals will fill essential roles, and bring a breadth and depth of experience that can help our administration advance prosperity and security for the American people,\" Obama said in a written statement. \"This dedicated and impressive group of public servants includes longtime advisors and a talented new addition to our team, and together we will work to serve our country and meet the challenges of this defining moment in history.\" On Friday, sources indicated that some of Obama's Cabinet posts were close to being filled. Two sources close to the transition team said New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner is \"on track\" to be offered the Treasury secretary post.  Watch CNN's Anderson Cooper discuss Obama's choices Â» . Transition officials told The Associated Press on Saturday that Obama planned to announce Geithner's appointment on Monday, along with that of Lawrence Summers as director of the National Economic Council. Summers is a former president of Harvard University and served as treasury secretary under Bill Clinton. Two sources said Friday that Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico is a serious contender for commerce secretary but that he could be chosen for another senior post. Geithner has played a large role in the government's efforts to wrangle the credit crisis, which has damaged markets and economies worldwide. Although a number of those efforts have been controversial, Geithner remains a well-regarded figure from Wall Street to Washington. Geithner began working with the Treasury Department in 1988 in the International Affairs division. In 1999, he became under-secretary of the Treasury for international affairs. Geithner would be charged with restoring stability to the financial markets, the banking system and the housing sector through oversight of the controversial $700 billion financial rescue package, of which about half is still available for use at the discretion of the Treasury secretary.  Watch CNN's John King discuss the posts with panelists Â» . The Dow Jones industrial index staged a late rally Friday after traders heard news of Geithner's possible appointment, rising by almost 500 points shortly before the market's closing time. The two sources close to the transition team said they do not consider Richardson's appointment to the Commerce Department to be a done deal. Richardson, 61, was a candidate for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Currently in his second term as New Mexico's governor, he served as ambassador to the United Nations and energy secretary in the Clinton administration. Richardson is also considered to be a possibility for the secretary of state post. Also Friday, Sen. Hillary Clinton's camp shot down reports that she had agreed to accept the secretary of state position. \"We're still in discussions, which are very much on track,\" said Philippe Reines, Clinton's senior adviser. \"Any reports beyond that are premature.\" The New York Times reported that Clinton would give up her Senate seat and accept the Cabinet post, citing two confidants, who said the decision was made after further consultation with Obama about the nature of her role and his foreign policy plans. A senior Obama aide told CNN there has been no development on a possible Clinton appointment since they informed CNN Thursday that she is \"on track\" to be nominated for secretary of state. Obama's transition team also appears close to choosing a national security adviser to the White House. Retired Marine Gen. Jim Jones has emerged as the president-elect's leading choice for the position, two sources close to the Obama transition team say. The sources said Jones has been given the impression by Obama that the job is his if he wants it. But the officials said that private discussions are under way and that no final decision has been made. The discussions are focused on precisely how much power Jones will have in the staff job, since he is used to being in a command role. Among his many posts, Jones served for several years as the operational commander for NATO.",

    "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The Central Intelligence Agency hired the private security firm Blackwater USA in 2004 to work on a covert program aimed at targeting and potentially killing top al Qaeda leaders, according to a source familiar with the program. CIA Director Leon Panetta canceled the covert program this year when he learned of its full scope. The existence of the program, which began in 2001, came to light earlier this year when CIA Director Leon Panetta canceled the effort, but it is only now that Blackwater's involvement has become known. That development was first reported Thursday in The New York Times. The program was part of a broader effort inside the CIA to develop the capacity to conduct training, surveillance and possible covert operations overseas, according to the source. The program was outsourced to contractors to \"put some distance\" between the effort and the U.S. government. By mid-2006, Blackwater's involvement in the program had ended, according to a U.S. official. Other contractors were brought in for other parts of the program, another source said. The total program cost \"millions,\" a U.S. official said. It is not known how much Blackwater was paid. The company -- now known as Xe -- did not return CNN's calls seeking comment. \"The program ebbed and flowed. There were different phases to it. There may have been different folks involved,\" the source said. U.S. officials have previously acknowledged that Panetta canceled the entire program this year when he learned of its full scope. At the time of the cancellation, officials said, renewal of the program was being considered. At that point, it had been brought to the new CIA director's attention. Panetta canceled the effort in part because Congress had not been notified about it, officials said. Also, some in the intelligence community were worried there could be a diplomatic disaster if contractors were caught performing such work in foreign countries. Former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who ran the agency from 2006 to 2009, downplayed the program during a speaking engagement in Washington. \"This was not a very prominent thing during my time as director,\" Hayden said. \"What you had were three separate efforts under three different directors to deal with an issue that everyone understood was a problem in a capacity that everyone agreed we should have.\" A spokesman for the CIA would not comment on the details of the still-classified program. \"Director Panetta thought this effort should be briefed to Congress, and he did so,\" spokesman George Little said. \"He also knew it hadn't been successful, so he ended it. Neither decision was difficult. This was clear and straightforward. \"Director Panetta did not tell the committees that the agency had misled the Congress or had broken the law. He decided that the time had come to brief Congress on a counterterrorism effort.\" Blackwater's extensive involvement in U.S. operations overseas, particularly in Iraq, has been controversial. The Iraqi government says that in a shooting in September 2007, Blackwater security guards killed 17 Iraqi civilians. Blackwater says its employees were returning fire after they were attacked by armed insurgents, but an Iraqi investigation concluded that the guards randomly fired at civilians without provocation. The incident led to the Iraqi government's refusal to renew the firm's operating license in the country when it expired in May. Although it lost the Iraq contract, the company, which changed its name to Xe earlier this year, continued to get multimillion-dollar contracts from the U.S. government for work in Afghanistan.",

    "input": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN)  -- Anna Nicole Smith's boyfriend and two doctors entered \"not guilty\" pleas Wednesday to new charges connected to the death of the former Playboy model and reality TV star in 2007. Howard K. Stern  appeared in court on charges connected to the death of Anna Nicole Smith. Howard K. Stern, Smith's lawyer and companion, appeared in Los Angeles County Superior Court, along with Dr. Khristine Eroshevich and Dr. Sandeep Kapoor to formally hear the charges. Smith's death in a Hollywood, Florida, hotel on February 8, 2007, was ruled to be from \"acute combined drug intoxication,\" the Broward County, Florida medical examiner said. The three are charged with an illegal conspiracy to prescribe, administer and dispense controlled substances to an addict. Stern faces 11 felony counts, while the doctors were charged with six each. They were all charged earlier this year with conspiring to give Smith drugs, but prosecutors revised the counts based on the latest findings from the investigation. The three defendants previously entered \"not guilty\" pleas to those charges. A preliminary hearing is set for next month in the case. A series of affidavits used by state investigators to obtain search warrants in their 2Â½-year probe was unsealed and released Tuesday. They revealed new details, including an account of one witness who told investigators she saw Stern inject Smith with drugs. A nanny hired to care for Smith's infant daughter, who was born in the Bahamas in September 2006, told investigators she witnessed Stern and Dr. Eroshevich \"crush pills, heat them to turn them into liquid and inject Smith,\" according to an affidavit from a state investigator. The nanny stated that \"after taking pills or being injected Smith would be 'like you were drinking,' often falling in the house, and sleeping for two or more days at a time,\" California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement Special Agent Danny Santiago said in a sworn statement. Doctors gave Smith numerous dangerous drugs over the three years before her death, including while she was pregnant, according to the affidavits. One investigator described Smith, whose real name was Vickie Lynn Marshall, as a \"drug seeker.\" She \"was given drugs in excessive amounts,\" according to a medical expert consulted and quoted by a state medical board investigator. Dr. Jill Klessig also told an investigator that \"in addition to the prescribing issues, there appears to have been a personal relationship\" between Smith and the two doctors that crossed the boundaries of professionalism. Investigators found photos of Dr. Eroshevich -- a woman -- and Smith \"naked in the bathtub in intimate embraces,\" according to one sworn statement. Dr. Klessig said \"such behavior constitutes unprofessional behavior.\" One affidavit references a video clip of Kapoor \"kissing and snuggling\" with Smith \"in a reclined position in a nightclub setting.\" Eroshevich traveled to the Bahamas to visit Smith and was with her for four days in Hollywood, Florida, four days before her death, an investigator said in an affidavit. The doctor personally visited a Burbank, California, pharmacy in September 2006 to get chloral hydrate, a sleep aid, for Smith to use in the Bahamas. It was just four days after Smith gave birth to a daughter in Nassau. \"I wouldn't give her chloral hydrate unless you want your picture on the front page of the National Enquirer,\" pharmacist Steve Mazlin told Eroshevich, according to the affidavit. Another pharmacist said that when he refused to fill a prescription for a long list of strong narcotics, he told Dr. Eroshevich the order amounted to \"pharmaceutical suicide.\" The affidavit from Jon Genens, a senior investigator with the California medical board, detailed dozens of prescriptions written for Smith -- under several aliases -- for a long list of narcotics and sleep aids. Genens said even during her pregnancy, starting in January 2006, Kapoor prescribed an average of 10 tablets of methadone per day for Smith. He noted that Kapoor lowered the dosage in the last three months of her pregnancy. The volume of dangerous drugs being ordered by doctors spurred the chief pharmacist at the store where most of the prescriptions were filled to call a drug expert for advice in late 2006, according to a sworn statement by California Department of Justice Special Agent Jennifer Doss. Dr. Greg Thompson told Doss that he recalled the dosages were \"dangerously high.\" \"Dr. Thompson stated they might work for a drug addict under supervised care, or with a dying cancer patient in a hospital, or 'if you were going to kill someone,' \" Doss said. Thompson told Doss he later \"admonished Dr. Eroshevich\" about the drugs she was requesting for Smith. \"Dr. Thompson stated Dr. Eroshevich was obviously not familiar with a lot of medications she was prescribing for Anna Nicole Smith,\" Doss said in her affidavit. The Doss affidavit said the doctor used Smith's boyfriend as a cover to get the prescriptions filled. \"Of the 12 medications found in Anna Nicole Smith's hotel room at the time of her death, seven medications were prescribed in the name of Howard K Stearn (believed to be Howard K Stern) by Dr. Eroshevich,\" Doss said. The drugs were apparently personally delivered to Smith in the Bahamas and Florida by her doctor, Doss said. \"It is reasonable to believe that Dr. Eroshevich provided Anna Nicole Smith prescription medications and controlled substances by transporting them from California to Nassau, Bahamas with her on her travels to visit Anna Nicole Smith,\" Doss said. CNN's Jack Hannah contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A Red Cross worker was killed Wednesday during shelling in the conflict zone in Sri Lanka, the third aid worker killed in six weeks, the International Committee of the Red Cross says. A photo supplied by a humanitarian group on Sunday shows civilians allegedly injured in government shelling. The worker, identified as Majurin Sivakurunathan, was killed along with his mother during an assault, a ICRC spokeswoman said. The fighting between the Sri Lankan troops and the rebel Tamil Tigers has intensified in the conflict area to the point that the ICRC can not get food to that area or help the sick and wounded, said Sarasi Wijeratne, a ICRC spokeswoman. The latest death comes after Sri Lanka angrily rebuked a U.N. official Tuesday over remarks by the organization that a civilian \"bloodbath\" had occurred in the north of the country. U.N. spokesman Gordon Weiss told CNN on Monday that hundreds of civilians died during weekend fighting because the Sri Lankan army had surrounded rebel fighters in the country's north, putting residents in the crossfire. The Foreign Ministry expressed its displeasure to Amin Awad, acting resident representative of the United Nations in Sri Lanka, about the comments. Mahinda Samarasinghe, Sri Lanka's minister of disaster management and human rights, initially said Weiss would be summoned to explain his remarks, but this did not happen because of diplomatic protocol, a source told CNN, noting that he is a junior official at the U.N. office in Colombo. Rebel claims of civilian deaths have been considerably higher than those provided by the U.N. Lawrence Christy, the head of the Tamils Rehabilitation Organization, said more than 3,200 civilians died in fighting from Sunday evening until Monday morning, the rebel Web site TamilNet reported.  Watch frustration build at the United Nations Â» . The Sri Lankan government has denied the allegations and accused the Tamils of \"taking the whole world for a ride with its well-engineered propaganda ploys,\" while turning their weapons on civilians trying to flee the combat zone. Tamil Tiger rebels have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the Tigers have been declared a terrorist organization by the European Union and more than 30 countries, including the United States.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Former captain Ricky Ponting insists he can still be a key player for Australia after becoming the third cricketer to score 13,000 Test runs on the opening day of the fourth and final match against India. Doubts were raised about Ponting's international future when he stood down as skipper early last year, but the 37-year-old has now scored two centuries in this series after a barren run with the bat. With Australia holding a 3-0 lead going into the Adelaide match, the tourists are facing a whitewash after Ponting and his successor Michael Clarke put on a record-breaking 252 runs on Tuesday. Ponting was on 137 and Clarke 140 at stumps as Australia reached 335-3 in hot conditions, breaking their own record for the fourth wicket against India at the venue. Ponting joined Indian opponents Sachin Tendulkar (15,432) and Rahul Dravid (13,262) as the only players to have passed the 13,000 milestone, ending the day 56 runs past that mark. It was his 41st Test century, putting him level with South Africa's second-placed Jacques Kallis and 10 behind Tendulkar. \"Am I still the player I was? I'm not sure,\" Ponting told reporters. \"You guys can answer that, you've seen me over a long period of time, but at the end of the day I think if I can keep making Test match hundreds or having an impact on winning games for Australia, then that's what I'm all about at the moment. \"It is interesting to ask the same question about Sachin or Dravid or Kallis, the guys the same sort of age as me that are still out there playing Test cricket. \"We've probably all realized that we can't play the same way forever, right through our careers, and I don't think there's been anybody that has been able to do that through 160 Test matches. \"But I'm giving it my best shot to be the best player I can be, and to win games for Australia, and if I can keep playing like I did today then hopefully there's more runs around the corner.\" Ponting scored 134 in Australia's innings victory in the second Test in Sydney, where Clarke posted an unbeaten 329 as they added 288 together. \"I felt I played better today than I did in Sydney as well, probably a better wicket to bat on than Sydney was -- there wasn't much in it for the Indian bowlers, no sideways movement for the quicks, not a lot of spin, a little bit of reverse swing during the middle of the day,\" Ponting said. He revealed he has adapted to his new role at No. 4, having dropped down a spot in the order. \"I know my place in the team, Michael's the leader now and I've stepped back from all that responsibility I once had,\" Ponting said. \"The last couple of years being the captain and batting at three was getting more and more difficult for me. Not being the captain now and having that little bit of extra time between change of innings to sit back and relax and take it all in has probably been good for me.\"",

    "input": "(CNN)  -- The son of a Florida couple known for adopting special-needs children was in his parents' room when they were slain in a home invasion last month, according to documents released by prosecutors. Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., 35, is one of seven people charged with murder. A nurse who works with special-needs children interviewed the boy, who has autism and speech issues, regarding the deaths of Byrd and Melanie Billings. The nurse told police that the child said \"two bad men\" were wearing black masks when they knocked on the door. They woke Byrd Billings and said, \"You're going to die.\" The child, whose age was not given, said one of the men counted to three \"before he shot mom and dad,\" and his father kept screaming, \"No way, no way.\" Byrd Billings grabbed the back of one man's neck and struggled with him before he was shot, the child said. The boy said Melanie Billings \"got shot in her shirt.\" Another child told the same nurse he was upstairs in bed and stayed in his room when he heard the knock on the door. The second boy recalled hearing \"seven booms\" and crept into the hallway. He heard Melanie Billings scream, he said, but stayed upstairs until police arrived. It was unclear from the interviews whether the men knocked on the bedroom door or the front door of the home. The Billingses were shot and killed July 9 in their Beulah, Florida, home. Seven males are charged with first-degree murder and home invasion robbery. An eighth suspect, a woman, faces a charge of being an accessory after the fact. The seven males, including a 16-year-old charged as an adult, pleaded not guilty to the charges last week. The children's accounts were contained in hundreds of pages of documents released this week by the state attorney's office as part of the pretrial discovery process. Also in the documents is a police interview with Leonard Patrick Gonzalez Jr., 35, one of the seven suspects and the man police believe was the organizer of the slayings. Two of the other suspects told authorities he was the lone gunman, according to court documents. Gonzalez told authorities in a July 22 interview that a group of car dealers did not like Byrd Billings and had gotten together to discuss the problem. Used car dealer Henry \"Cab\" Tice came to him, Gonzalez said, and told him the group wanted Billings killed, but he refused to do it. Another son of Billings told police that a man named \"Cab\" had \"double-crossed\" his father and that the son was present when the two men argued. Tice has been questioned but not charged in the slayings. He is charged, however, with one count of grand theft for allegedly writing a series of bad checks to Billings, authorities have said. Various interviews in the documents point to a close relationship between Tice and Gonzalez. Also released by prosecutors was a transcript of a police interview with Tice in which he acknowledged accepting a $20,000 loan from a man he later learned was connected with the Mexican Mafia. Tice said he was told his family could be killed if the money was not repaid. Police had previously said Tice was believed to owe the Mexican Mafia money. Contacted by CNN Tuesday, Tice refused comment. But in an interview Monday with CNN affiliate WEAR, Tice said Gonzalez's comments about him constitute an \"act of a desperate man.\" \"There is nobody that I know in Pensacola that would want to see Bud Billings killed,\" Tice told WEAR, using Billings' nickname. \"There are business people in Pensacola that are upset with him, that were upset with him, but nobody that I know would want to see Bud Billings killed.\" The Billingses each had two biological children and had adopted 13 children. Police have said nine of the children were home during the slayings and several were believed to have seen the gunmen. One child managed to flee the home and seek help from a neighbor. Autopsy reports also were released. They showed that the Billingses were shot multiple times. Byrd Billings also had a white zip tie on his left arm, according to the report. The eighth suspect in the case, Pamela Wiggins, was taken back into custody Monday after her bond was raised from $10,000 to $500,000. Authorities said they found a safe belonging to the Billingses in Wiggins' backyard. That safe contained prescription medications, family documents and jewelry and was taken from the home during the slayings. Family members have since confirmed that a second safe was in the home and that it contained $164,000, antique jewelry and legal documents. The second safe was not taken. The released documents also said that safe contained a sealed hard drive, a detail not previously revealed. The Billings family agreed to allow authorities access to that hard drive, according to the documents. Prosecutors believe there were dual motives in the killings: robbery and a contracted hit, a source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN last month. The source said prosecutors were working under the belief that most of the suspects in the case were told only that they were robbing the Billingses, but that Gonzalez and other yet-unnamed suspects also were plotting to kill the couple. The source was not sure of the alleged motive behind the slayings. Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan has said publicly his office believes a contract hit was a possibility. The state attorney's office said last month it was focusing on the robbery, but was willing to consider other motives. CNN's Ross Levitt and Carolina Sanchez contributed to this report.",

Air and ground strikes under way in the remote mountain region are aimed at large numbers of militant fighters. The troops are targeting \"hundreds of hardened al Qaeda and Taliban in dug-in positions,\" said officials familiar with the intelligence. The operation started two days ago in the region, where al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was once thought to be hiding. The Bush administration has been criticized for not sending enough ground forces to Tora Bora in December 2001 to capture the militant after the invasion that toppled the Taliban. \"U.S. and Afghan forces engaged al Qaeda and other violent extremist fighters in eastern Afghanistan during a combined arms assault using precision munitions. There have been no substantiated reports of civilian casualties in this engagement,\" said Capt. Vanessa R. Bowman, a U.S. Army spokeswoman. \"The targets were carefully chosen to pinpoint enemy positions and eliminate the likelihood of harming innocent civilians,\" she said. \"This region has provided an ideal environment to conceal enemy support bases and training sites, as well as plan and launch attacks aimed at terrorizing innocent civilians, both inside and outside the region.\" Also Wednesday, a manager at a private British security firm in Afghanistan was shot and killed in the capital Kabul, a spokesman for the company said. \"We did lose a manager today in Kabul to unknown assailants,\" Christopher Beese, spokesman for ArmorGroup International, said Wednesday. He said next of kin have been notified and an inquiry into the incident has begun. The name of the man, a British national, was not released. \"It's bad news. He was a very well-respected man,\" Beese said, noting that the victim had experience in Afghanistan going back to the early 1980s. Beese -- who said the man's role was to run the administration of the 1,200-person-strong security presence in the country -- described the man as a \"logistics manager\" and \"all things to all people.\" The firm, which has been operating in Afghanistan since 2002, mostly provides diplomatic protection and has contracts with the British and American governments.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Apple Inc. hasn't said how much future generations of the iPhone will cost, but an editor of a technology blog said his site shelled out $5,000 to get its hands on a possible prototype. Gizmodo Senior Editor Jesus Diaz said his blog paid \"a source\" $5,000 for the phone, which was shown in a video on the blog Monday. \"Paying for an exclusive has always been done in the journalism world. There are people who admit they do it and people who do not. We have done it,\" Diaz told CNN's Gabriela Frias in an interview on CNN en EspaÃ±ol's \"En Efectivo.\" Diaz said the blog's source obtained the phone after it was left in a bar. \"An engineer was in a bar, celebrating his birthday. He drank two drinks too many and forgot the phone,\" Diaz said. He said Gizmodo returned the phone to Apple after receiving a letter asking for it. \"It has come to our attention that Gizmodo is currently in possession of a device that belongs to Apple,\" says the short letter from Apple's lawyer to the blog. \"This letter constitutes a formal request that you return the device to Apple. Please let me know where to pick up the unit.\" Gizmodo, which posted the letter on its site, said the letter erases any doubt that the phone is the real deal. \"Just so you know, we didn't know this was stolen when we bought it,\" wrote Brian Lam, the site's editorial director, in his response. \"Now that we definitely know it's not some knockoff and it really is Apple's, I'm happy to see it returned to its rightful owner. \"P.S. I hope you take it easy on the kid who lost it. I don't think he loves anything more than Apple except, well, beer.\" Photos of the fourth-generation iPhone prototype first appeared on the tech blog Engadget over the weekend. The site said whoever sent the photos found the phone on the floor of a bar in San Jose, California. On Monday, Gizmodo said it had obtained the device, but wouldn't say how. Diaz said the price Gizmodo paid for the phone was worth it, even though editors weren't able to take advantage of all its features. \"It was remotely deactivated by Apple,\" he said. \"But the screen is better, double the resolution of past versions. The quality of the product is much better. ... It is pleasing to touch it.\" The find was widely considered the real thing in the tech world. \"At this point we're pretty much certain it is this summer's new model,\" wrote Wired magazine. \"Somebody at Apple is in big trouble.\" Daring Fireball blogger John Gruber, who is known to have connections inside Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters, said on his blog that Apple had reported a prototype stolen. He also said Apple has a patent out for a phone with a ceramic backing. Some of the images online appeared to show just such a backing. Gizmodo's photos of the device's internal components show they're labeled as Apple products. The blog also said a computer recognized the device as an iPhone, and the phone apparently runs the yet-to-be-released iPhone OS 4.0. Apple has not confirmed that a new version of the iPhone exists, though analysts widely expect the fourth generation of the device will be released in the summer. Apple did not return CNN requests for comment. Even if the new iPhone is real, it's important to keep in mind that the device is just a prototype. It's unclear how many of its features will be available on the new phone. A quick glance at the photos shows a flatter, less curvy iPhone. The back of the phone is completely flat, unlike the current model, which is tapered to fit the curve of a palm. The new phone's back is ceramic rather than plastic, and has an aluminum border with two volume buttons instead of just one. Unlike the current model, it has a front-facing camera. It also has a camera on the back, which is larger than the one on the back of the current 3GS model.",

The alert, issued Sunday by the State Department, is in effect until August 20 and supersedes an alert issued August 20, 2009. \"Recent violent attacks have caused the U.S. Embassy to urge U.S. citizens to delay unnecessary travel to parts of Michoacan, Durango, Coahuila and Chihuahua ... and to advise U.S. citizens residing or traveling in those areas to exercise extreme caution,\" the alert says. \"Drug cartels and associated criminal elements have retaliated violently against individuals who speak out against them or whom they otherwise view as a threat to their organization.

Ciudad Juarez, in Chihuahua state across the border from El Paso, Texas, is the most violent city in the nation. \"The situation in the state of Chihuahua, specifically Ciudad Juarez, is of special concern,\" the alert says. \"Mexican authorities report that more than 2,600 people were killed in Ciudad Juarez in 2009,\" the report states. \"Additionally, this city of 1.3 million people experienced more than 16,000 car thefts and 1,900 carjackings in 2009. U.S. citizens should pay close attention to their surroundings while traveling in Ciudad Juarez, avoid isolated locations during late night and early morning hours, and remain alert to news reports.\" But the problems are not limited to Juarez, the State Department says. \"Mexican drug cartels are engaged in violent conflict -- both among themselves and with Mexican security services -- for control of narcotics trafficking routes along the U.S.-Mexico border,\" the report says. \"In order to combat violence, the government of Mexico has deployed military troops throughout the country. U.S. citizens should cooperate fully with official checkpoints when traveling on Mexican highways. \"Some recent Mexican army and police confrontations with drug cartels have resembled small-unit combat, with cartels employing automatic weapons and grenades. Large firefights have taken place in towns and cities across Mexico, but occur mostly in northern Mexico, including Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana, Chihuahua City, Nogales, Matamoros, Reynosa and Monterrey. During some of these incidents, U.S. citizens have been trapped and temporarily prevented from leaving the area.\" A number of areas along the border continue to experience a rapid growth in crime, with robberies, homicides, petty thefts and carjackings increasing during the past year nationwide, the alert says. The State Department reports notable spikes in Chihuahua, Sinaloa, and northern Baja California. \"Ciudad Juarez, Tijuana and Nogales are among the cities which have experienced public shootouts during daylight hours in shopping centers and other public venues,\" the alert says. \"Criminals have followed and harassed U.S. citizens traveling in their vehicles in border areas including Nuevo Laredo, Matamoros, and Tijuana. Travelers on the highways between Monterrey and other parts of Mexico to the United States (notably through Nuevo Laredo and Matamoros) have been targeted for robbery and violence and have also inadvertently been caught in incidents of gunfire between criminals and Mexican law enforcement. Such incidents are more likely to occur at night but may occur at any time,\" the alert says.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- For Andy Copeland, the \"Aimee Day\" event he'd been waiting for happened when he was in church. Copeland was in the pews at a Baptist church in Augusta, Georgia, on Sunday morning when a text message notified him his 24-year-old daughter could not only breathe on her own, but also talk for the first time in weeks. It was a major milestone for Aimee, who is battling a flesh-eating bacteria that has already led surgeons to amputate her hands, part of her abdomen, one of her legs and her remaining foot in an effort to stay ahead of the disease. Family counters flesh-eating bacteria with faith . \"I was so excited I wanted to spring up out of the pew and into the aisle and do a dance,\" Andy Copeland posted on the family's website Monday. \"My fellow Baptists probably would not have appreciated that, so I resisted the urge. Instead, my fingers danced across my phone.\" Two weeks ago, in a post on his Facebook page, Copeland wrote that the family would mark that milestone \"forever for the rest of your life.\" It would be several hours before he was able to see his daughter -- she had put off her family for much of the day after being given a drug that caused nausea and intestinal cramps, and Copeland said he was doing \"emotional backflips\" the entire time. But when he did see her Sunday evening, \"Aimee was expressive and she clearly elucidated her thoughts,\" he wrote. \"Her long-term memory was intact. We listened to the iPod Shuffle that Eddie Mattock of Pittsburgh had sent her, and she told me the story of Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter,\" Copeland wrote. \"We discussed ideas of how to utilize wilderness therapy/eco-psychology for amputees. We talked about her current physical condition. We smiled and at times we said nothing. Just being there and seeing her happiness put a certain peace in my heart.\" And on Monday, \"Aimee continues to talk and joke,\" he added. \"Her nurse bumped her head and Aimee said, 'Now my nurse needs a nurse!' Then she winked at us and said, 'I'll take care of her.' She then waved her arm in the air and said, 'these fingers can work magic.' She grinned at us. She knew she didn't have any fingers, but she's not worried about it either. She knows everything is going to be fine. We know everything is going to be fine. We all know it is going to be a long and challenging road, but we will handle it together.\" Father: 'I have never seen such a strong display of courage' AImee Copeland was taken off a ventilator May 20 and had been mouthing words without sound for several days before her voice was heard, her family said. Her ordeal began May 1, when she was riding a makeshift zip line across the Little Tallapoosa River, about 50 miles west of Atlanta. The line snapped, and she fell and got a gash in her left calf that took 22 staples to close. Three days later, still in pain, she went to an emergency room. Doctors eventually determined she had necrotizing fasciitis caused by the flesh-devouring bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila. Her father has written regularly since about her situation, with over 72,500 \"likes\" on his Facebook blog devoted to Aimee's fight. And the psychology department at the University of West Georgia -- where Aimee has been pursuing her master's degree in psychology -- also posted regular updates online. A number of bacteria that are common in the environment but rarely cause serious infections can lead to the disease. When it gets into the bloodstream -- such as through a cut -- doctors typically move aggressively to excise even healthy tissue near the infection site in hopes of ensuring none of the dangerous bacteria remain. The disease attacks and destroys healthy tissue and is fatal about 20% of the time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates that fewer than 250 such cases occur each year in the United States, though estimates are imprecise since doctors do not have to report the cases to health authorities. Since Copeland's struggle came to light, there have been reports of others fighting the same disease. They include Lana Kuykendall, a South Carolina woman also diagnosed earlier this month, a few days after giving birth to twins. She has had at least 11 \"debridement surgeries\" but thus far no amputations, with her brother Brian Swaffer noting late last week that the condition is confined to his sister's legs and she, too, is breathing on her own.",

    "input": "KINGSTON, Tennessee (CNN)  -- The Environmental Protection Agency has found high levels of arsenic and heavy metals in two rivers in central Tennessee that are near the site of a spill that unleashed more than a billion gallons of coal waste. Four days after the spill, the water is cloudy on the east bank of the Clinch River in Kingston, Tennessee. The agency said it found \"several heavy metals\" in the water in levels that are slightly above safe drinking-water standards but \"below concentrations\" known to be harmful to humans. \"The one exception may be arsenic,\" the agency said in a letter to an affected community. \"One sample of river water out of many taken indicated concentrations that are very high and further investigations are in progress.\" However, arsenic was not detected in a water intake facility near Kingston, Tennessee, where the spill happened, said EPA spokeswoman Laura Niles. The metals were found in the Emory and Clinch rivers, near the site of a major spill last week that unleashed enough sludge to fill 1,660 Olympic-size swimming pools. The EPA's letter comes as the head of the largest public power company in the nation pledged to clean up the massive spill. \"This is not a time where TVA holds its head high,\" said Tom Kilgore, president and CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority. \"But we won't hang our head, either, because that won't get the job done. I'm here to tell you that we will clean it up, and we will clean it up right.\" The sludge is a byproduct of the ash from coal combustion. A retention site at the Tennessee Valley Authority's power plant in Kingston, about 40 miles west of Knoxville, contained the waste until a wall breached last Monday, sending the sludge downhill to damage 15 homes and cover at least 300 acres. All residents in the area were evacuated, and three homes were deemed uninhabitable, according to the TVA. The TVA's initial estimate for the spill tripled from 1.8 million cubic yards, or more than 360 million gallons of sludge, to 5.4 million cubic yards, or more than 1 billion gallons. The plant sits on the Clinch River, which is a tributary of the Tennessee River. Video footage from the river, a popular fishing site, reveals piles of dead fish on its banks. The TVA says that has nothing to do with the toxicity of the sludge, though environmental advocates say the ash contains concentrated levels of mercury and arsenic. TVA officials have said water quality tests from a nearby water treatment facility have shown that the water from the river intake meets federal and state guidelines for potable water. But coal operation critics remain concerned about the long-term effects of the spill, and residents have expressed concerns about drinking water, especially from wells. Roane County Emergency Management Director Howie Rose said the county has asked the state and the federal Environmental Protection Agency to monitor groundwater from wells around the area. He and Kilgore spoke at a town hall meeting Sunday. Rose said the county has also requested air quality tests from the state and federal agencies. Steve Ahlstedt, an independent aquatic biologist, told CNN that a spill of this magnitude probably will affect the area's ecological balance. \"Once the ash has settled to the bottom of the rivers, all heavy metals will hang around for a long time,\" he said. \"When coal releases into the water, the mussel population goes into deep freeze. They are the 'canary in the coal mine.' They are the main indicator of how healthy our water is.\" CNN's Helena DeMoura contributed to this report.",

    "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- With U.S. gasoline prices setting records, opponents of the war in Iraq have raised a new complaint this week: The budget windfall that skyrocketing oil prices has given Baghdad. Iraqi employees attend the opening ceremony of a new oil refinery plant in Najaf, Iraq, on March 15. Crude oil futures topped $112 a barrel in Wednesday's intraday trading in New York -- up from about $35 a barrel before the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Though Iraq's oil exports have yet to top prewar levels, the price rise has meant a $6.4 billion surplus for the Iraqi government, according to the Pentagon's last quarterly report on the war. With the five-year-old war's cost to U.S. taxpayers estimated at more than $600 billion, the Iraqi windfall provoked sharp questions from Congress during two days of testimony by the top U.S. officials in Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker. \"This nation's facing record deficits, and the Iraqis have translated their oil revenues into budget surpluses rather than effective services,\" Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, said Wednesday. \"Under these circumstances and with a strategic risk to our nation and our military readiness, we and the American people must ask: Why should we stay in Iraq in large numbers?\" Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-California, proposed the Iraqi government pay the cost of stationing U.S. troops in its country under any future agreement between Washington and Baghdad -- and said he would introduce legislation to require that. \"The United States government and the people of the United States have paid an awful price,\" Rohrabacher said. \"It's time for the Iraqis to pay that price for their own protection.\" Crocker said Iraq has allocated $13 billion for reconstruction projects in 2008 and plans to add another $5 billion this summer. The U.S. focus will shift to improving Iraq's economy at the local level and expanding its export capacity, he said. \"The era of U.S.-funded major infrastructure projects is over. We are seeking to ensure that our assistance, in partnership with the Iraqis, leverages Iraq's own resources,\" he said. Five years after Baghdad fell to a U.S.-led army, many Iraqis still lack basic services such as water, sewer connections and electricity. Nevertheless, Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari said the government is \"doing its best\" to spend money to improve the country. \"I think the government has a responsibility, definitely, to care for its people, to provide services and to use the oil money for reconstruction and development,\" Zebari said. The United States has committed about $45 billion to Iraq's reconstruction since the March 2003 invasion, according to a report last month from the Government Accountability Office. The agency, the investigative arm of Congress, concluded that Iraq's oil revenues could top $100 billion in 2007 and 2008. When President Bush announced he was dispatching almost 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Iraq in January 2007, he told Americans that Iraqis would spend $10 billion on reconstruction projects and pass a law allocating the country's oil wealth as steps toward a political settlement of the war. The GAO, however, found Iraq had spent only 7 percent of that budget by November 2007, and the proposed oil law has stalled in the country's fractious parliament. Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh blamed the ongoing insurgency and the \"socialist command economy\" left behind by ousted dictator Saddam Hussein for the slow pace of reconstruction. \"At the time we were trying to reform it, open up the system, when we are faced with the terrible challenge of al Qaeda and this tornado of terrorism afflicting the society day in, day out,\" Saleh said. \"People should not be too judgmental.\" But Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Missouri, said Tuesday the issue is \"a burr in the saddle of the American people\" -- particularly since Bush administration officials told Congress before the invasion that Iraq could finance its own reconstruction with oil revenues. Rep. Walter Jones of North Carolina -- a Republican opponent of the war -- pointed out the United States \"is borrowing money from foreign governments to pay our bills\" while oil and gas prices have more than doubled. \"The issue is that we in this Congress are going to be cutting programs to help our elderly with health care,\" he said Wednesday. \"The American people want to know that the Iraqi government understands that we do not have treasure and blood to go on and on and on.\" E-mail to a friend .

    "input": "Fairhope, Alabama (CNN)  -- Mark Castlow and Jimbo Meador have a solution for saving the oil-covered birds in the Gulf of Mexico. However, they also have a problem. I saw the solution firsthand during a quick ride through a Gulf inlet, near Meador's home of Fairhope, Alabama, about a 20-minute drive outside Mobile. The two co-owners of Florida-based Dragonfly Boatworks have been working at a breakneck pace for weeks to modify the design of their shallow draft fishing boats, turning them into mobile triage units for pelicans, seagulls, and pretty much any kind of critter caught in the catastrophe. Their concern on the 65th day of the underwater gusher is deep rooted. Castlow, who says he has \"salt water in his blood,\" grew up surfing off Miami and the Keys. Meador, a former shrimper, was raised along Alabama's Gulf shores. They're keenly aware that each day adds to the death toll of birds and other animals dying in pockets of oil that invade their natural habitat. \"We have to do everything we can to take care of them,\" said Meador, who said he has a serious interest in the \"birding world.\" \"We want to do try to do what's right to help them because they can't help themselves.\" Oil-soaked birds: Rescue or kill? Unlike more traditional boats, which have deep keels that bog down when they push into shallow marshlands, the custom Dragonfly boats can operate in less than a foot of water. Their broad hulls create very little wake that might further alarm wildlife; and they've even been painted a light green color to blend better with their surroundings. On board, Castlow and Meador have added a whole set of tools to help wildlife rescuers: a large, skid-proof worktable for crews to handle animals, an adjustable shade canopy which can be easily lowered to slip beneath bayou tree branches, fine mist nozzles to cool the scorching summer temperatures for workers and critters. The oil won't hamper the boat's engines, thanks to a special cleaning solution. The men consulted wildlife biologists and other scientists as they rushed to make the improvements, and they've found big donors, like Florida musician Jimmy Buffett, who are willing to help them make the boats available to rescuers free of charge. The vessels will be outfitted with wireless Internet access, and plans are in the works to team up with Google Earth to enable anyone to track the boats online in real time. Onboard Web cameras donated by a group in Houston, Texas, will allow classrooms or anyone else to watch rescuers in action. So far, Buffett has funded construction of one prototype boat, according to the duo. The plan is to produce a new boat every seven days from here on out. After the cleanup, the animal rescue groups will be allowed to keep the boats for use in research projects. Clean up crews trample pelican nests . No one will make money off of the deal, but the animals could benefit immensely, including brown pelicans, a species native to the eastern Gulf which has fallen victim to the oil. Brown pelicans spent almost 40 years on the endangered species list until last year. Salvaging just a few of the birds is so vital to the survival of the species, said Lee Hollingsworth, a wildlife adviser with the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in Wales. \"Something has got to be done, and of course, it's worth saving the bird.\" Brown pelican: Symbol of survival . Every day adds to the death toll of the region's birds and other animals. According to a June 22 report from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, rescue officials have collected 1,746 birds along the coastline from Louisiana to Florida. Of those, 749 were alive and \"visibly oiled.\" Another 997 were found dead, and 265 of those were visibly oiled. Birds that were found alive and then euthanized numbered 143. The report states BP's Deepwater Horizon spill is not responsible for all dead birds. How much is a pelican worth? Although the vessels have been praised by wildlife experts, including marine biologists at the University of Southern Mississippi, Castlow and Meador say they've run into dead ends trying to get their boats into the hands of animal rescuers. They've called federal authorities and BP too, but they say no one seems able to willing to tell them how and when the boats might be put to work. Castlow and Meador call their support network the DEA, the Dragonfly Environmental Army, which is made up of those who have extended a helping hand, which include suppliers, donors and volunteers. They're hoping the combined forces of their group can break through the bureaucracy and get their boats in the hands of animal rescuers. It is frustrating to both men, but they say they've been so encouraged by wildlife experts who have universally praised their innovation, that they're pressing on, convinced that no less than the lives of thousands of birds are at stake, and the future of their beloved Gulf too. \"And we're going to get all of these people, and we are going to break that ceiling,\" said Castlow. \"And we will go through it -- because it's our livelihood.\" CNN's Katie Ross and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- The House Energy and Commerce Committee requested documents and information Monday from Wright County Egg and Hillandale Farms of Iowa related to the recent salmonella outbreak and egg recalls, according to a news release from the office of the committee's chairman, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-California. Waxman and Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, sent letters to the two Iowa-based egg producers asking for details on the contamination of their egg products, including when government officials and customers of the affected egg products were first notified of the contamination. The committee also asked for the inspection records for the companies' facilities, the companies' internal protocols and standards for monitoring and analyzing their products, and documents related to allegations of health, safety, environmental, or animal cruelty violations for the companies or any related companies, the news release said. Responses from each egg company are expected by Tuesday, September 7, according to the letters. Hillandale Farms said it shared \"a number of common suppliers\" with Wright County Egg, including a company called Quality Egg, which provided feed and young birds. \"We are devastated that our eggs have been implicated in making people sick,\" Hillandale farms said in a statement Sunday. \"We have never had a product recall in our 45-year history, and it flies in the face of our mission to provide wholesome, nutritious food for the American public. We regret that anyone might have become ill, and the concern and disruption this has caused our customers.\" Both Wright County and Quality Egg are owned by the DeCoster family, which has a string of agribusiness interests in the Midwest and Northeast. Those companies' records have come under new scrutiny since the recalls were announced earlier this month. In June, company owner Austin \"Jack\" DeCoster admitted to 10 civil counts of animal cruelty in Maine after a nonprofit animal welfare group conducted an undercover video investigation and forwarded its findings to Maine animal welfare officials. In a statement issued Monday morning, Wright County Egg said it was working with the Food and Drug Administration on the current recalls and defended its record. \"Wright County Egg strives to operate our farms in the most responsible manner, and our management team has worked closely with FDA through their review of our farms. We have reviewed [FDA] Commissioner [Margaret] Hamburg's comments to the media, but because we have not received any written reports from FDA to date, it would be inappropriate to respond to her remarks. It is important to note that any concerns raised verbally during FDA's on-farm visit were immediately addressed or are in the process of being addressed,\" the statement said. \"When issues have been raised about our farms, our management team has addressed them swiftly and effectively, working with recognized outside experts to identify and implement corrective measures for our operations,\" it said. \"We are approaching our work with FDA in the same forthright manner.\" The Energy and Commerce Committee isn't the only group on Capitol Hill looking for answers. The chairwoman of the House FDA and Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Rep.Rosa DeLauro, D-Connecticut, sent a letter Monday to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Hamburg, asking questions about the recent egg recall. In the letter, DeLauro asked the United States Department of Agriculture and the FDA, which share jurisdiction in this area, about the investigation into the DeCoster farm's safety record and the oversight of its operations. She also inquired about the possibility of the tainted eggs being used by federal nutrition programs.",

Sealed with a kiss. Sharapova celebrates her victory over Petrova. The former world number one had come into the second grand slam of the season with only two matches in a minor tournament in Poland under her belt, but surprised her fellow Russian with a 6-2 1-6 8-6 victory. Still playing with tape on her troublesome right shoulder, Sharapova showed no ill effects as she won five straight games to take the first set. Petrova hit back in style to force a decider and took the lead with an early break. But Sharapova hit back in the eighth game to level and held her own service under pressure in the next two games. Petrova finally wilted as she served at 6-7, giving Sharapova match point with a double fault and then hitting wide on a forehand after two hours 12 minutes. Sharapova will now face qualifier Yaroslava Shvedova of Kazakhstan for a place in the last 16. She had shoulder surgery in August last year and missed both the U.S. Open and Australian Open as fears for her future in the game grew. She made a brief comeback by playing doubles in Miami in March before a return to singles action at the Warsaw Open where she reached the quarterfinals before losing to Alona Bondarenko of Ukraine. Meanwhile, defending champion Ana Ivanovic showed a welcome return to form by sweeping into the last 32 with a 6-1 6-2 victory over Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn.

Three Drug Enforcement Administration special agents were among the dead, according to the DEA, which did not identify them. The agents were first DEA agents to be killed in Afghanistan. \"Like all those who give their lives in service to America, they were doing their duty, and they were doing this nation proud,\" President Obama said at the Naval Air Station in Jacksonville, Florida. \"Now, it is our duty, as a nation, to keep their memory alive in our hearts and to carry on their work, to take care of their families, to keep our country safe,\" Obama said. It was the largest number of Americans killed in Afghanistan in a single day in more than four years, according to CNN records. The NATO force ruled out enemy fire in the crash that killed four Americans and said enemy action was not thought to be the cause of the other. A helicopter went down in the west of the country after a raid on suspected drug traffickers. Seven U.S. service members and three U.S. civilians were killed, according to an ISAF statement. Fourteen Afghan service members, 11 U.S. service members and one U.S. civilian were injured in the crash. Monday's crash marked the second-deadliest incident in the agency's 36-year history, according to entries on the DEA's Web site. The deadliest incident for the DEA occurred August 27, 1994, when a plane carrying five special agents crashed in the Peruvian Andes during a reconnaissance mission, according to the DEA's Web site. One of Monday's helicopter crashes occurred after the helicopter was returning from a raid on a compound, ISAF said. The joint international security force killed more than a dozen enemy fighters while searching the compound, ISAF said. The site was thought to harbor insurgents tied to narcotics trafficking in western Afghanistan. The militants were killed in a firefight when insurgents confronted the joint force. As the force was leaving, a helicopter \"went down due to unconfirmed reasons,\" ISAF said. A recovery operation was launched. DEA Acting Administrator Michele Leonhart said the crash occurred as the agents and seven U.S. service members were returning \"from a completed, joint counternarcotics mission.\" \"DEA is an extremely tight family, and the death of these three brave agents is a devastating loss for us,\" she said in a written statement. Attorney General Eric Holder said the circumstances of the crash were under investigation. \"I want to express my deepest condolences to the families of these heroic agents,\" Holder said in a written statement. \"During this difficult time, the families of these agents are foremost in our thoughts and prayers.\" In Monday's other deadly crash, four U.S. service members were killed when two helicopters apparently collided in the air in southern Afghanistan. Two other NATO service members were injured. \"The incident is currently being investigated, but it is confirmed that hostile fire was not involved,\" ISAF said. \"Each and every death is a tremendous loss for the family and friends of each service member and civilian. Our grief is compounded when we have such a significant loss on one day,\" Col. Wayne Shanks, an ISAF spokesman, said in a written statement. ISAF is not announcing the names of the dead or which branch of the service they were in, pending the notification of their relatives. The DEA has had a presence in Afghanistan for four years. The agency said Monday that it is increasing its presence in Kabul to up to about 50 agents. CNN's Carol Cratty and Brooke Baldwin in Washington contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Bringing a growing health concern to Congress, scientists squared off Thursday over whether cell phones contribute to brain cancer. Rep. Denis Kucinich of Ohio holds a model of a 5-year-old child's brain absorbing cell phone radiation. Studies have indicated that long-term cell phone use may be associated with brain cancer, according to Dr. Ronald Herberman, director of the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, and Dr. David Carpenter, director of Institute for Health and the Environment at University of Albany. They both testified in front of the House Subcommittee on Domestic Policy. \"I cannot tell this committee that cell phones are definitely dangerous. But, I certainly cannot tell you that they are safe,\" Herberman said. Herberman and Carpenter cited the results from a study recently presented by Dr. Lennart Hardell of Ãrebro University in Sweden. The results indicated that people who use cell phones have double the chance of developing malignant brain tumors and acoustic neuromas, which are tumors on the hearing nerve. The study also said people under age 20 were more than five times as likely to develop brain cancer. But Dr. Robert Hoover, director or Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program at the National Cancer Institute, said the study has not yet appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, so has not come under sufficient scrutiny. The evidence for the connection between cell phones and cancer is inconclusive and more research is needed, he said. \"Larger studies are needed to sort out chance and bias,\" Hoover testified. Interphone, a series of multinational studies on the risk of cancer from cell phones, has not found an increase in tumors associated with the first 10 years of mobile phone use, he said. Some findings show an increased risk of tumors diagnosed on the side of the head that the cell phone is pressed against, but this pattern has not been seen consistently, Hoover said. CTIA, the International Association for Wireless Telecommunications, declined the invitation to testify, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, a former Democratic presidential candidate from Ohio, who led the hearing, said. Steve Largent, CEO of CTIA, issued a statement Wednesday saying the industry has supported scientific research on these issues and supports the Federal Communications Commision's safety guidelines. \"The available scientific evidence and expert reviews from leading global health organizations such as the American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute, United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization reflect a consensus based on published scientific research showing that there is no reason for concern,\" Largent's statement said. The overall evidence for the cancer-phone link has not been statistically significant at a 95 percent confidence level, a standard in science, Carpenter said. But he also noted that U.S.-funded research is very scarce. \"Are we at the same place we were with smoking and lung cancer 30 years ago?\" he asked. Carpenter and Herberman testified that the risk of brain cancer for children is far greater than for adults. Herberman demonstrated a model showing that the radiation from cell phones would penetrate far deeper into a 5-year-old's brain than an adult's.  See models from researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Â» . But the incidence of brain cancer in children has not increased significantly from the late 1980s to 2005, Hoover said. The Federal Communications Commission limits cell phone radio frequency energy emissions, called the specific absorption rate (SAR), at 1.6 watts per kilogram, as measured over one gram of tissue. The standard was developed in 1997 in consultation with Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a professional association open to everyone, including manufacturers and health specialists. But the SAR standard reflects a biological response to cell phone radio frequency energy heating tissue, Kucinich said. Many experiments show that radio frequency energy does cause \"biological effects\" without heating tissue, although not all of those effects are harmful, Carpenter said. Hoover agreed that there could be such effects related to cancer risk, but they have not been properly vetted in a laboratory. The FCC itself does not have the expertise to evaluate whether this standard is appropriate protection for possible heath risks, Julius Knapp, director of the FCC's Office of Engineering and Technology, testified. The hearing took place just a week after the Cleveland Clinic reported a study showing that keeping a cell phone on talk mode in a pocket can decrease sperm quality. Herberman had issued a warning to physicians, scientists, and staff at the University of Pittsburgh in July advising them to limit cell phone use because of the possible risk of cancer. The Israeli Health Ministry endorsed this recommendation within a week, he said. Ellen Marks of Lafayette, California, whose husband found out he had a brain tumor on his right frontal lobe in May, attended the hearing. The tumor is on the same side of his head where he held his cell phone, which he used about 30 hours per month. She believes the tumor is the result of cell phone use. \"I often threatened to throw it in the garbage, and how I wish I had,\" she said. \"This horror could have been avoided with a simple warning.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The French Foreign Ministry and a top African Union official have denounced a military coup in the west African nation of Niger. The ministry said France \"condemns all taking of power by nonconstitutional means\" and calls on people in Niger \"to show responsibility in the interest of the country,\" which gained its independence from France in 1960. Jean Ping, the chairman of the 53-nation African Union, meanwhile, called for a quick return of \"constitutional order\" and said the organization is ready to help facilitate the process. He said he had been following developments in the nation with concern after a Niger military official announced the constitution had been suspended. President Mamadou Tandja is said to be detained in a military camp. The violence may have been prompted by a collapse of talks between the government and the opposition over a recent referendum allowing the president to hold power indefinitely, according to the United Nations, which also called for a quick resolution. French journalist Diallo Doudacar said the situation in Niger was calm Friday. \"The children are going to school, the shops are open,\" he said. A \"demonstration of joy\" in support of the military was held Friday afternoon, Doudacar said. \"The people are very happy,\" he said. \"The coup ends a nine-month debate that blocked out all other subjects. We have gone through so many coups that it doesn't really affect us anymore.\" Ping condemned the coup. \"The chairperson of the commission stresses that the relevant AU instruments systematically condemn any unconstitutional change and, accordingly, he condemns the seizure of power by force that took place in Niger,\" said a statement from his office. \"The secretary-general has called on the stakeholders in Niger to swiftly revert to constitutional order in the settlement of the political crisis,\" said a statement from U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Thursday's order to suspend the constitution was attributed to the Superior Council for the Restoration of Democracy. It also suspended all institutions, urged citizens to remain calm and called for support from the international community. Dana Palade, a spokeswoman for World Vision, who is in the capital, Niamey, said gunfire rang out in the streets Thursday. The French Embassy also reported hearing intermittent gunfire near the palace. Tensions have flared in Niger recently. Tandja, in office since December 1999, had been trying to stay in power beyond the time mandated by the constitution. \"That may well have been ... an act on his behalf that precipitated the act today,\" P.J. Crowley, assistant U.S. secretary of state, said Thursday. The United States does not condone violence, but \"clearly we think this underscores that Niger needs to move ahead with the elections and the formation of a new government,\" Crowley said. Niger, one of the poorest countries in Africa, has about 8 percent of the world's uranium. It has had lucrative uranium contracts, particularly with China. The west African nation has a population of about 15 million and lies between the Sahara Desert and Nigeria. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Rescuers in Iran worked furiously Tuesday to free people trapped under rubble, a day after a powerful earthquake rippled through a rural stretch of villages in the country's southeastern region, Iranian media reported. Iran's Press TV said aftershocks followed the 6.5 magnitude Monday quake that struck at least 70 villages in Kerman province. Iranian authorities recorded seven deaths and dozens of injuries so far, but authorities expect the casualty toll to rise in the quake -- just over 60 miles away from the site of a deadly tremor that killed 30,000 people seven years ago in the city of Bam. Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency reported that scores of people are trapped in the debris of buildings that have been destroyed. Many such sites are in hard-to-reach locations, making any rescue operations even more difficult. Are you there? Share earthquake stories with CNN iReport . Jessica Sigala, a U.S. Geological Survey physicist in Golden, Colorado, thinks the number of deaths could range from between 10 to 1,000, based on statistics and information about past earthquakes. She said that while this latest event was similar in magnitude to the Bam quake, which measured at 6.6 magnitude, the Monday quake struck a more remote region about 63 miles away from that city. \"That's an important thing to realize. That distance will help decrease the fatality rate as well as the damage,\" she said. \"There isn't a big city anywhere to be seen.\" But, she said, that doesn't mean the quake wasn't felt through the region. In fact, said Kerman governor Esmail Najjar, the tremors were felt as far away as Hormozgan province, which lies on the Persian Gulf, and Sistan-Baluchestan province, which borders Afghanistan and Pakistan. It was also felt in Bam and other cities, such as Zahedan, Khash and Iranshahr. \"Considering the dimensions of the damage, the death toll is expected to rise,\" Najjar was quoted as saying by the IRNA news agency. The high-impact zone's population -- which Najjar estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000 people -- was widely dispersed. The quake's epicenter was around the town of Hosseinabad. Many of the structures in the quake-hit region use adobe as construction material, and that can crumble in earthquakes, Press TV reported. Photos in Iranian media showed pictures of rubble and people huddled outside damaged buildings. Images showed some bodies wrapped in sheets and people crying. Javad Kamali, a deputy governor for Kerman province, told the IRNA that the tremor knocked down phone lines throughout the region. Military and law enforcement workers could communicate only using wireless technology, he added. Relief and recovery teams, some from outside the area, have converged around the village of Hosseinabad, between the towns of Fahraj and Rigan, Kamali said. In addition, IRNA reported that Kerman province's disaster council convened an emergency meeting to assess possible damage and coordinate potential aid and assistance efforts. Iran lies on a series of seismic fault lines and experiences earthquakes almost daily, and at times, they have had devastating consequences, such as the quake in Bam. Last year, an earthquake struck Hormozgan province in southern Iran, injuring about 700 people in the port city of Bandar Abbas, state media reported. And there's been plenty of activity in recent months as well. In early November, a 4.9-magnitude earthquake in the northwestern Lorestan province injured at least 80 people, according to IRNA. One person died two months earlier when a quake measuring magnitude-5.5 struck southern Iran, and in August three were killed after a 5.7-magnitude tremor in northern Iran, several state news agencies reported. CNN's Joe Sterling contributed to this report .",

    "input": "PARIS, France -- World number three Novak Djokovic crashed out of the Paris Masters after being trounced in his opening match by veteran Frenchman Fabrice Santoro on Wednesday. Fabrice Santoro returns the ball during his shock second-round victory against Novak Djokovic. The 34-year-old Santoro, who beat world No. 5 Andy Roddick at the Lyon Grand Prix last week, again rose to the occasion in front of his home fans as he stormed to a 6-3 6-2 second-round victory against the Serb. It was the first time the two players had met, with Djokovic making his first outing since losing to David Nalbandian in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters two weeks ago. Djokovic, like the American Roddick, has already qualified for the season-ending Masters Cup and will now have extra time to prepare for the event in Shanghai starting next month. The 20-year-old said he was struggling following dental surgery to remove two wisdom teeth. \"I couldn't give my 100 percent, not even 30 percent of my possibilities,\" Djokobvic said. \"He deserved to win. I'm still on medications. I didn't practise for a whole week, I only started practising two days ago. Physically, I'm not feeling at all good.\" The result is a boost for rising British star Andy Murray, who earlier kept alive his hopes of an unexpected place at the Masters Cup by winning his first match in Paris and was expected to face Djokovic. The 20-year-old, who has missed three months this season due to a wrist injury, beat Jarkko Nieminen of Finland 7-6 (7-5) 6-3 to progress into the third round. The 15th seed is seeking to overtake Tommy Haas, who holds the eighth and final place ahead of the showpiece event in Shanghai. Murray, who trails the German by just three points, has not beaten Djokovic in three meetings so far but he has never played his unseeded next opponent Santoro. Ninth seed Haas, who has struggled with illness and injury this year, will play Djokovic's compatriot Janko Tipsarevic in the second round. Murray, who won his second title this year at the St Petersburg Open last Sunday, made a confident start against Nieminen and showed little sign of the stiff back he suffered after a minor car crash on Monday. He held his serve to love against a player who was beaten in the final of the Swiss Indoors event by Roger Federer last weekend, but then struggled for his best form as the first set went to a tiebreak. The Scot was broken just one point after having a winner overturned following an on-court appeal, but he leveled immediately and then broke Nieminen again to win a third successive game before serving out for victory. Defending champin and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, one of six players to have already qualified for Shanghai, beat Argentina's Juan Del Potro 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 in his opening match on Wednesday. The Russian, fined for \"lack of effort\" after his defeat by Croatian qualifier Marian Cilic in St Petersburg, will next face Marcos Baghdatis of Cyprus in round three after Baghdatis shocked 13th seed Ivan Ljubicic. Ivo Karlovic broke Roger Federer's serve for the first time in his life, but the top seed and world number one progressed in a late match on Wednesday. Croatian Karlovic, the tallest man in tennis at 2.08 metres, went down 6-4 4-6 6-3 as Federer played for the first time at the Bercy event since 2003. Federer had gone 67 service games over four previous matches without a loss before Karlovic ended his duck to claim their second set. But the Swiss top seed got straight back in harness, breaking to start the final set and rolling ahead against a man he had just beaten days earlier in the Basel semifinals. World numbet two Rafael Nadal also reached the third round after thrashing Italy's Filippo Volandri 6-3 6-1. The Spaniard will next play Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland, who won by the same scoreline against 16th seed Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina. E-mail to a friend .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- When Brian Burton, a little known DJ operating under the name of Danger Mouse, released \"The Grey Album\" in 2003, he brought to mainstream attention a new form of musical genre made possible by the advance of modern technology and the Internet. He also inadvertently sparked a debate about record labels' monopoly of music ownership. \"The Grey Album\" consists of a series of \"mash-ups,\" songs made by splicing together elements from two or more separate tracks, the vocals from one, the music from others. Burton used the vocal tracks from rapper Jay Z's \"Black Album\" and music from The Beatles' \"White Album\". The album was well received. His decision to bring together the world's biggest hip hop star with the best-selling band of all time probably contributed to its positive reception by the critics. It was described as \"the most creatively captivating\" album of the year by The Boston Globe and voted best album of 2004 by Entertainment Weekly. But its success probably owes just as much to the controversy it caused. While Jay Z had released his \"a capella\" vocal tracks with the intention that they could be used as sampling material, Burton had borrowed the Beatles' music without permission from the copyright holders, EMI Music. EMI moved swiftly to block sales of the album but anti-copyright activists stepped in, and battle lines were drawn. Downhill Battle, a group that campaigns for a fairer music industry, organized an online protest, dubbed \"Grey Tuesday\" in which they offered up the album to download for free on approximately 170 Web sites as a form of deliberate civil disobedience. With over 100,000 downloads, Downhill Battle claims that \"The Grey Album\" was the number one album in the United States on the day. The two groups represented polar opposite points of view. EMI's position was that they earn a livelihood out of the music. By blocking the sale of this album they were simply protecting their investment. Downhill Battle, on the other hand, argued that while copyright holders should get a cut of the proceeds from the sale of music, the licence fees were far too high and too large a proportion goes to the music label and not to individual artists. Moreover, they argued, music was built on a tradition of sharing and much that is good has come from one artist passing the baton to another, who might give a different interpretation, even improve, on an original work. \"The reason we have copyright is to ensure that creators are able to benefit from the things that they do so that they can keep creating,\" says Nicholas Reville, Director at Downhill Battle. \"What's happened to copyright with music recently is that it has been used as a way to restrict creativity, limit art and censor what people are allowed to do. \"What made 'The Grey Album' so significant was that it brought together two of the most popular musical acts from two different eras into a totally new piece of art that was considered by everybody as culturally significant. There's no reason why any society would not want that creation to exist.\" Reville says that Downhill Battle's argument is that copyright should exist but that laws should be reviewed so that bedroom musicians everywhere can have access to sample music without needing a lawyer to guide them through the legal quagmire. The \"mash-up\" is not a new phenomenon. In Indian music there is a tradition of borrowing tunes and melodies and incorporating them into new compositions. Western folk music also encouraged the practice of passing on songs for reinterpretation by new generations. As a musical genre, the \"mash-up's\" origins lie in the birth of hip hop, when DJs such as Kool Herc and Grandmaster Flash began using the drum sections form vinyl records as a back-beat for MC's to rap over. The development of the Internet has simply fast-forwarded the culture of borrowing by making it all that much easier -- \"mash-up\" artists have access to so much more music than their forebears. And peer-to-peer and social networking sites mean that \"mash-ups\" have found a distribution system that by-passes the usual gate-keepers - record companies and music stores. \"There are elements of this idea that have been around for a long time,\" says Rupert Evans of yourspins.com. \"Mozart wrote a piano concerto where every time you finished a bar you're meant to roll a dice to see what it was you played next. \"People have always been into the idea of how you can break things down and put them back together and I think it's something that's been highlighted recently due to technology and the hip hop 'vibe' has taken it and tried to twist it around. \"When people first started recording music it meant you were stuck with just one version. There isn't supposed to be a definitive version.\" It would seem that artists are beginning to cotton on. At yourspins.com musicians such as Moby, Robbie Williams, Roots Manuva and Natasha Bedingfield have released their work for remixing by the public. The musicians provide the user with a selection of variations on the different elements of a song -- bass line, drum, vocals, etc. -- which can be put together in any order. The result is \"as many versions of the song as there are atoms in the universe,\" says Evans. There is one large distinction between what Danger Mouse was doing with \"The Grey Album\" and the music produced by remixers on yourspins.com. While \"The Grey Album\" was championed as an original work of art, Evans does not believe that the same can be said of yourspins.com's remixes. \"It's a hard distinction to defend but [Danger Mouse] picked a couple of things himself. There was some creativity in saying: 'I can put this and that together', whereas we are giving people a toolkit,\" says Evans. In yourspins.com's legal framework, the copyright still belongs to the artist who can even sell on the remix if they wish. Evans says that the laws have relaxed since he first set up yourspins.com. \"At the beginning a lawyer was telling me that every time someone wanted to go on my Web site they would have to sign a paper saying that they weren't going to claim copyright over what they had created, and the artist was going to have to sign a paper giving permission every time, which obviously wouldn't have worked,\" he says. Technology is breaking down the barriers between musicians and their audiences, allowing both sides to interact in ways that would have been unimaginable thirty years ago, but the record companies are still holding on stubbornly to their monopoly of the market, and it seems there is still a fair way to go before musical culture becomes truly democratic.

    "input": "Hong Kong (CNN) -- How much would you pay to get your child into an Ivy League university? For Gerard and Lily Chow, it seems the sky was the limit. In 2007, the Hong Kong couple enlisted Harvard-lecturer-turned-admissions-consultant Mark Zimny to steer their two sons through elite U.S. boarding schools into a top-ranked university-- preferably Harvard. For a monthly $4000 fee per child, their \"total education management\" package included extensive admissions counseling, arranging homestays, private tutoring, and extra-curricular activities, whereby Zimny and his team functioned as \"parents away from parents\" for their sons. The Chows later switched to a retainer of $1 million per child. But in 2010, before their sons applied to university, the Chows sued Zimny to recover their $2 million retainer, alleging fraud, breach of conduct, and unjust enrichment, according to court documents. Zimny denied any wrongdoing to CNN, alleging the Chows sought to end their relationship after \"poaching\" one of his contract staff as a cheaper replacement. Admissions consultants say the Chow case is an anomaly, both in terms of the amount the couple paid and the assurances Zimny allegedly made. But it highlights the strong appetite among the wealthiest in Hong Kong for elite U.S. education and the nebulous role that a burgeoning flock of consultants play in the process. Hong Kong is the 16th leading place of origin for international enrollment at U.S. colleges and universities, according to the International Institute of Education, with its students increasing 1.3% to 8,136 in the 2010-11 academic year. \"When people are looking at the U.S. education system, it's seen as one of the best in the world,\" said Susan Joan Mauriello, an American who moved to Hong Kong in 2005 and quickly identified admissions consulting as a business opportunity. \"Everybody was talking about top U.S. colleges-- it was clearly something that was very important to a lot of people, something that was very well-respected,\" she added. \"Especially when you send your children to the U.S., you want them to develop critical and creative thinking skills,\" she explained, adding that an American degree is seen by Hong Kongers as providing \"increased opportunities for their children throughout the rest of their lives.\" Since setting up her firm, Mauriello said a wealth of new or expanded consultancies have cropped up, particularly ones offering comprehensive packages that not only encompass preparation for the standardized admission exam (SAT), but also services like tutoring and debate training. Some consultancies, such as Capstone, begin grooming students as early as in eighth grade (around ages 13-14), giving them \"a well-built resume that doesn't spike in their final year (before entering university),\" said Capstone's founder, Ronald Po. \"Before as an admissions consultant (in Hong Kong), you could work part-time and do it out of Starbucks. Now most companies have a full-time staff, they have their own offices, and it's all-year-round support,\" Po said, citing his annual client base as growing from four to up to 40 students. Affluent Asian families view elite U.S. education as a form of conspicuous consumption and are willing to \"throw money at it,\" Zimny said, describing his clients as \"the 1% of the 1%.\" Case in point: Gerard Chow is a member of the family that owns the Chow Sang Sang jewelry empire in Hong Kong. Most parents who seek Capstone's services are investment bank partners, lawyers, or entrepreneurs, Po said, quoting fees of $6,450-$19,350 for a one-year package. Mauriello said her clients have varying income backgrounds, but they all prioritize their children's education. She quoted her average yearly fee as $3,225-$7,750. While international students may genuinely need help navigating the unfamiliar terrain of the U.S. application process, the Chow case raises the specter of the unscrupulous consultant-- in an unregulated profession. The U.S.-based Independent Education Consultants Association (IECA) denounced Zimny as a \"con artist,\" describing the monthly $8,000 fees for the two Chow sons as approximating \"what should be a single fee, over a multi-year period, to work comprehensively with a student.\" It pointed out that Zimny's communications with the Chows \"were all about 'getting in,'\" saying that success should be measured by a student's university experience, not admission. \"The thing I worry about consultants is they can do a lot of work in terms of writing essays and it's unethical,\" said Rachel Rubin, a lecturer at Emmanuel College in Boston who specializes in higher education admissions policy. \"But it's good if they're helping students find a good fit and what they want in a college, rather than how can we game the system to get into the school we want?\" Harvard was even less enthusiastic. \"While it is certainly possible that in individual cases an admissions consultant can be helpful to an applicant, we have encountered no evidence to indicate that is the case generally,\" said spokesperson Kevin Galvin. Mauriello said competition for places at top schools had become fierce. \"Students, who ten years ago would have gotten into Harvard, Princeton, and Yale, might not be able to now,\" she said. To gain an edge, some wealthy applicants offer donations to boarding schools and universities, consultants said. In their lawsuit, the Chows claim Zimny convinced them that elite schools unofficially expected donations from foreign applicants. Through their lawyer, the Chows declined to comment on the pending case. While donations are \"not an absolute requirement,\" Zimny told CNN, they are a \"common practice\" that can pivotally influence boarding school and university admissions. E-mails submitted to the court reveal extensive discussions between Zimny and Loomis Chaffee boarding school officials over the 2007-08 academic year, regarding the wealth and likelihood of donations from the Chows. Boarding schools conduct \"intensive screening of applicants so they can assess who has the potential to donate money once the child is admitted, and then the development directors work feverishly to court the constituencies,\" Zimny said. Loomis Chaffee denied conducting \"financial screenings of any applicants except for those applying for financial aid, although on occasion we become aware of a prospective family's history of or capacity for philanthropic support,\" according to its director of development, Tim Struthers, who exchanged numerous e-mails with Zimny. Zimny said he also personally donated tens of thousands of dollars to Loomis Chaffee to \"advance the prospects\" of the Chow sons -- as well as his future clients. He added that these donations were factored into his $250,000 \"extraordinary admission fee\" charged in successful cases that required extensive lobbying. While Struthers confirmed that Zimny made several gifts to the school, he said they were unrelated to the Chow sons, adding that \"no donation or promise of donation was made to Loomis Chaffee by the Chows or Mr. Zimny on their behalf, as part of the admission process.\" He said donations were neither common nor pivotally influential in admissions decisions. In March 2008, the Chow sons were admitted to Loomis Chaffee -- a decision Struthers said was merited, given their \"academic records, extracurricular involvement, and leadership potential.\" Zimny attributed their admission to his donations, saying that the sons' secondary school admission test scores (SSAT) were weak. He said he had stopped working with the Chow sons before they applied to university. Zimny said his services can also include brokering introduction meetings between potential donors from Asia and development officials at U.S. universities, adding that schools welcomed these introductions as a way of fielding multitudes of donation requests. In his view, \"Money is money, whether it's coming from a random family in Hong Kong or a fifth-generation Whitney applying to Yale.\" He added that donations have to be presented \"in a way that doesn't look like quid pro quo.\" Consultant Susan Joan Mauriello disagreed, saying she has heard of donations making a significant difference in admissions decisions only in \"development cases,\" which involve families with multiple generations of alumni that have made significant donations over the years. Harvard declined to comment on whether donations influence admissions decisions. The IECA said \"no educational consultant will act as a middleman for donations to a school,\" adding that consultants \"will put the family directly in touch with a university's development office and donations would be made directly.\" But the appetite among Hong Kong's elite for getting their offspring into top universities is unlikely to fade. \"The way to differentiate yourself is \"that one line on your resume that says what university you came from,\" Capstone's Po said. \"That's one of the few elements that sticks with you for the rest of your life professionally.\"",

But after feeling harassed by airport screeners Tuesday, the 50-year-old Portland, Oregon, man stripped off his clothes in a protest that brought him even more attention from airport authorities, national headlines and a short stint in jail. \"I just took off my clothes and said 'See, I don't have any explosives,'\" Brennan told CNN on Wednesday. \"The individuals at TSA are just doing their job and the whole organization needs to find a balance between safety and privacy .

Faldo is now almost as famous for designing golf courses as he is for playing the sport. He also serves as a television commentator. A knighthood is the highest honor, and recipients may use the title \"Sir\" before their names. The equivalent for women is to be awarded the title of \"Dame.\" They recognize a \"pre-eminent contribution\" in any field. Next come CBEs, or Commanders of the Order of the British Empire, which recognize contribution to a slightly lesser degree. Recipients may not use the title of sir or dame but may use the initials after their names. Sassoon will be awarded a CBE for his services to the British hairdressing industry. It recognizes a lifetime of achievement for Sassoon, who as a young boy spent years in a London orphanage after his father left and his mother could not afford to care for him. Later, after his mother dreamed of her son being in a barber shop, she apprenticed him to a local barber. That began a career that saw him develop two classic hairstyles of the Sixties -- the Bob and the even shorter Five-Point Cut -- along with an eponymous hair care line, range of hair care tools, and chain of salons. Also receiving a CBE is Jonathan Pryce, a Golden Globe-nominated actor who has had roles in the \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies, \"Ronin,\" and the James Bond film \"Tomorrow Never Dies.\" He won a best actor award in 1995 at Cannes for his part in the movie \"Carrington.\" Actor Alan Cumming will receive an OBE, or Order of the British Empire, awarded for notable achievement in any field. He was recognized for \"services to film, theater and the arts and to activism for equal rights for the gay and lesbian community.\" A large number of artists and others in creative fields are featured on this year's list. Andrew Motion, who was Britain's poet laureate until he stepped down this year, will receive a knighthood, and several names in fashion will also receive awards. Fashion designer Jeff Banks will receive a CBE; Frances Marie Corner, the head of the London College of Fashion, will receive an OBE; and MBEs will go to Christopher Bailey, the creative director at Burberry, and Natalie Massenet, the founder of online designer shopping site Net-a-Porter. Honors lists are published twice a year -- once on New Year's Day and once in June, to mark the queen's \"official\" birthday. The queen's actual birthday is in April but she celebrates it in June because the weather is better.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Famed tenor Luciano Pavarotti, who died on Thursday at the age of 71, was one of opera's most adaptable and ebullient performers, appearing on stage with singers as varied as Dame Joan Sutherland, U2's Bono and Liza Minnelli. Much as the star power of Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov revived widespread interest in classical ballet in the 1970s and 1980s, Pavarotti's beaming charisma and bravura style captured the attention of the late-20th-century audience for opera. Widely considered the greatest tenor of his time, Pavarotti began his life modestly in Modena, the son of Fernando, a baker and amateur singer, and Adele, who worked at the local tobacco factory. \"I dreamed to become a singer when I was four and I hear my father singing in the church with a beautiful tenor voice,\" he told CNN in a 1991 interview. \"And I say to myself, well, let's try to do something.\" The young Pavarotti -- who played soccer with his town's junior team -- joined the church choir with his father and traveled with him to Wales, where the singing group won first prize at the Llangollen International singing competition. Although the experience left Pavarotti enthralled with singing, he graduated from the local teaching institute in 1955 and taught elementary school for two years, then worked as an insurance salesman. He continued his vocal studies, however, working first with with Arrigo Pola and then with Ettore Campogalliani. Then, in 1961, Pavarotti won the prestigious Concorso Internazionale and made his operatic debut at the Reggio Emilia Theater as Rodolfo in Giacomo Puccini's \"La Boheme.\" His fame spread throughout Italy and then throughout the European continent as he made his international debut in Giuseppe Verdi's \"La Traviata\" in Belgrade. When Dame Joan Sutherland brought him on-stage with her during a performance of Gaetano Donizetti's \"Lucia di Lammermoor\" with the Greater Miami Opera in 1965, Pavarotti began his American career. He debuted at New York's Metropolitan Opera House three years later, and eventually marked 379 performances there, including his final opera, Puccini's \"Tosca\" in 2004, in which he performed as the painter Mario Cavaradossi. In between Pavarotti sold millions of records and raised millions of dollars for charity through benefit concerts, often sharing the stage with pop stars as well as other opera singers. Of his recordings, 1990's \"The Essential Pavarotti\" was the first classical album to reach No. 1 on Britain's pop charts, where it remained for five weeks. 1994's \"The Three Tenors in Concert,\" with Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras, remains the best selling classical album of all time. Pavarotti joined with Domingo and Carreras in 1990, and although critics complained that Pavarotti's vocal skills were waning, the trio performed together for 14 years. Among his charities were a 1995 \"Concert for Bosnia\" that raised $8.5 million and other concerts that raised $3.3 million for refugees from Afghanistan and $1 million for refugees from Kosovo. In artistic terms, Pavarotti brought to the stage a voice neatly suited to the traditional bel canto, or \"beautiful singing\" style, essential to 17th-century Italian opera. As much about intensity as pitch, bel canto focuses the voice, concentrating the sound with both outstanding warmth and agility. So demanding is this work even of the best singers that Pavarotti in concert recital could be seen rising to the balls of his feet during the most challenging passages. A long, white handkerchief always hung from one hand as he sang, his eyebrows arched high in the effort, forming an expression seemingly of surprise at his own success. From his small beginnings, Pavarotti rose to great heights, performing in front of 500,000 people in New York's Central Park -- a concert seen by millions on television -- and before another 300,000 at Paris' Eiffel Tower. He won countless awards and honors -- including five Grammies -- and was named United Nations Messenger for Peace by then-Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He launched an international competition, The Pavarotti International Voice Competition, in 1982. He even founded a teaching facility for young singers in his home town. His signature aria, Puccini's \"Nessun Dorma\" from \"Turandot,\" was chosen as the theme music for the 1990 soccer World Cup, hosted by Italy. He also performed the aria at the opening ceremony of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin. The great singer was also known as an equestrian expert, organizing one of the international show jumping circuit's most important competitions, the Pavarotti International, in Modena. Coinciding with that event, Pavarotti also staged an annual charity concert, Pavarotti and Friends. The portly singer retired from staged opera in 2004, but was on a \"farewell tour\" of concerts when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2006 and underwent emergency surgery to remove the tumor. Although the remaining concerts of his tour were canceled, his management said that he hoped to resume the tour in 2007. When cancer finally stopped Pavarotti from singing, it was only the second interruption of his career. \"I think I just stopped for one year when from a kid I become a man and the voice is changing,\" he said in 1991. \"I was an alto and became a tenor and that is the only time I think I remember to have stopped singing. Otherwise I have sung all my life.\" E-mail to a friend . CNN's Porter Anderson contributed to this report.",

John McCain, a hero at a bipartisan dinner Monday night and encouraged politicians to reach across the aisle. President-elect Barack Obama greets Sen. John McCain on stage after praising him at a bipartisan dinner. \"I could stand here and recite the long list of John's bipartisan accomplishments ...\" Obama said. \"Campaign finance reform. Immigration. The Patients' Bill of Rights. All those times he has crossed the aisle and risked the ire of his party for the good of his country. And yet, what makes John such a rare and courageous public servant is not the accomplishments themselves, but the true motivation behind them.\" McCain returned the gracious feelings at the dinner. \"I am very grateful to the president-elect and to all of you for this very considerate gesture, and for allowing me to play a small role in the inauguration of the 44th president of the United States, even if it isn't the one I had in mind a few months ago,\" McCain said. \"Tomorrow, the President-elect will accept the burdensome privilege of leading America to its next accomplishments and its future greatness,\" McCain went on to say. \"He has my sincere best wishes for his success, and my promise of assistance. For his success will be our success.\" After praising McCain, Obama urged everyone to take the bipartisan dinner past \"just an inaugural tradition\" and turn it into a \"new way of doing the people's business in this city.\" \"We will not always agree on everything in the months to come, and we will have our share of arguments and debates,\" Obama said. \"But let us strive always to find that common ground, and to defend together those common ideals, for it is the only way we can meet the very big and very serious challenges that we face right now.\" On the eve of his inauguration, the president-elect even made time for a joke. \"I'm here tonight to say a few words about an American hero I have come to know very well and admire very much -- Sen. John McCain,\" Obama said as he opened his speech. \"And then, according to the rules agreed to by both parties, John will have approximately 30 seconds to make a rebuttal.\" Obama's speech at the bipartisan dinner capped a day filled by appearances, including visiting wounded soldiers and exhorting Americans to spend more time in the service of others. In Washington people took in the sights of pre-inauguration activities and concerts. \"The energy on the streets is something I've never seen before,\" said Nancy Wigal, who lives in Vernon Square. \"People are walking lighter, standing taller and are reaching out to one another. It feels like hope. It feels like shared happiness.\" Wigal said Obama's inauguration has given residents hope that change actually will happen. \"It's all because of Obama -- we dare to feel positive that we may have actually elected a leader, not just a politician,\" she said. \"There are impromptu progressive dinner parties, cookouts and house parties. We finally feel like a real change has come to town.\" Obama began his day with a surprise visit to wounded soldiers at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He met with 14 patients injured in either Iraq or Afghanistan. Obama visited a National Day of Service project, stopping by the Sasha Bruce House, an emergency shelter for homeless teenagers in the Washington area.  Watch Obama speak about service on the eve of his inauguration Â» . The shelter provides a variety of services, including counseling, job training, and substance abuse prevention assistance, for up to 15 teenagers at a time. Roughly 30 teenagers are spending the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday volunteering at the shelter by helping to renovate a dorm room. Obama rolled up his sleeves and pitched in during the visit, using a roller to help paint a couple of walls and a piece of furniture. He also quoted King to the teenagers, noting that \"everybody can be great [because] everybody can serve.\" \"Don't underestimate the power of people who join together to accomplish amazing things,\" Obama added. Given the crisis America is currently in, \"we can't allow any idle hands. Everybody's got to pitch in.\" Wigal said Obama's actions and words make her believe the president-elect has the skills needed to help the country move forward. \"Those of us who live and work here, who try to create, shape, influence and move policy forward, are feeling as if we can finally do something that'll result in forward motion,\" Wigal said. \"We believe we have a leader who listens to those who work the issues every day and know the real solutions.\" For Wigal, that's exactly what makes Inauguration Day so important. \"Tomorrow is going to be the biggest day in our country's history since its creation,\" she said. During Monday's activities Obama also cited the heroics of U.S. Airways pilot Chesley Sullenberger, who safely landed a crippled commercial airliner in the Hudson River last Thursday, saving the lives of all 155 people on board. \"If everybody did their job as well as he did [his] job, we would be in pretty good shape,\" Obama said. Obama has personally invited Sullenberger to the inauguration. Obama later joined Vice President-elect Joe Biden at a high school where students were making blankets and greeting cards, among other things, for soldiers overseas. Speaking to the students, Obama again invoked King's memory, noting the slain civil rights leader had \"dedicated his life to working at the grassroots level ... on behalf of justice and equality.\" \"I am making a commitment to you, as your next president, that we are going to make government work,\" Obama said. But, he warned, \"government can only do so much. If we're just waiting around for someone else to do it for us ... it never gets done. We're going to have to take responsibility, all of us.\" Incoming first lady Michelle Obama, joined by Jill Biden, the wife of the vice president-elect, spent the morning at a separate volunteer service event at RFK Stadium, where people were assembling care packages for soldiers serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. Martin Luther King Jr. Day is traditionally viewed as a day to encourage greater volunteerism.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The buzz began hours before the start of the race at the U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials: Would one of the most-elusive records in long distance running set by a legend long dead finally fall? It's a question that has been asked at nearly every Olympic track trials since the brash Steve Prefontaine set the meet record for men's 5,000 meters in 1972. Sure, there have been runners since who have been more than capable of breaking the record. They just always came up short when it counted. The record, though, was not the most pressing issue on Galen Rupp's mind when he stepped up to the starting line on a cool, crisp night last week at Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon. His goal, he told reporters: a top-three finish that would guarantee him a ticket to the Olympics. Rupp, who had already qualified for the 10,000 meters, was running against the Kenyan-born Bernard Lagat, a favorite. Unseen, though, was another opponent: Prefontaine, whose presence decades after his death on May 30, 1975, at the age of 24, has loomed large over long distance running in the United States. There are eerie similarities between Rupp and Prefontaine: Both were born and reared in Oregon, trained at the University of Oregon and later ran for the Oregon Track Club. And both matured as runners following their first Olympic appearance. Rupp finished out of the medals in the 10,000 meters at the Beijing Games in 2008. Pre, as Prefontaine was known to fans, was charismatic and brash, predicting wins and sometimes taunting opponents. His following was huge by track standards, with thousands attending his races. At one point, an opponent donned a \"Stop Pre\" T-shirt to counter fans, dubbed \"Pre's People,\" wearing \"Go Pre\" shirts. At the 1972 Games in Munich, Prefontaine promised that if it came down to \"a pure guts race at the end,\" he was the only one who could win. He placed fourth in a heartbreaking finish after leading for the last four laps of the 5,000 meters, a race that saw Finland's Lasse Viren win gold in a late surge. By most accounts, he was a favorite to medal, if not win gold, at the 1976 Games in Montreal. Prefontaine died in a car accident hours after running his last race at Hayward Field. At the time of his death, he owned every American record between 2,000 and 10,000 meters and between two miles and six miles, according to stats provided by the University of Oregon. When 26-year-old Rupp took to the track for the 5,000 meters Thursday at Hayward Field, the same track where Prefontaine set the meet record in 1972, he already owned an American record in the 10,000 meter. The crowd of thousands roared with the start of the race, just like they had decades earlier for Prefontaine's race. \"This is the only place in the country, possibly the world, that you're going to get that kind of reception for the 5,000,\" Rupp said later. It wasn't surprising that Rupp led the last laps. The surprise was the finish, after Rupp was overtaken by Lagat in the final lap and then surged the final 20 meters to the finish line. Rupp's time: 13:22.67, less than two-tenths of a second ahead of Prefontaine's 13:22.8. \"To hear I got the record, that's unreal,\" Rupp told reporters shortly after the race. \"Anytime you're mentioned in the same breath as Steve Prefontaine, it's a huge compliment.\" But more than that, Rupp's record-breaking run opens the door for U.S. long distance runners to be considered contenders at the London Olympics. Only one American man has medaled since Frank Shorter won the gold medal in the marathon in 1972 and a silver medal in 1976, and that was Meb Keflezighi, who won the silver in the marathon at the Athens Games in 2004. Maybe, just maybe, Rupp will bring home the medal that eluded Prefontaine.",

    "input": "New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- When we started thinking about the contents of this piece, our first thought was to highlight all of the progress, accomplishments and successes that the St. Bernard Project has achieved since Katrina. We thought of numbers: 302 -- the number of homes that the St. Bernard Project has rebuilt; 85 -- the number of residents who utilize our free evidenced-based clinical services at our Center for Wellness and Mental Health each week. We thought of all of those who have made it possible: 25,000 volunteers; nearly 1,000 AmeriCorps members; companies like Entergy, Patron Tequila, KPMG, GE and United Way, and citizens like Ari Mittleman, who has made 20 volunteer trips over the past four years, and the Solon family from Massachusetts, who has raised enough funds to move three families home and who spent the summer volunteering with the project. Then, we remembered Mr. Andre, an 82-year old St. Bernard Parish resident who was a World War II veteran and who, when we met him six months after Katrina was still sleeping each night in his Ford Ranger pickup while waiting for a FEMA trailer that he would not receive for another six weeks. As we were saying goodbye to Mr. Andre, he made a simple request: \"Don't forget us. We want to come home. We all want to come home.\" When we thought about Mr. Andre, we realized a few things: First, the St. Bernard Project's successes are dwarfed by the progress that the greater New Orleans area has made. Second, despite the progress, significant work is left. The New Orleans area is a wonderful place to live, and the city is, in many ways, thriving. Families are reuniting, neighborhoods are being restored, and there is a shared sense of pride in the region's resilience. In Mayor Mitch Landrieu, we have a leader who is committed to uniting the city and bringing to government the true character of New Orleans' residents: inclusion, hard work and problem solving. An entrepreneurial movement is surging through the city, led by GNO Inc., Tulane University and Idea Village. Thanks to New Schools for New Orleans, there are dozens of highly effective charter schools, like Akili Academy, and because of a revitalized public school board, the chances are much better that children will receive the education that they deserve. Nearly five years after Katrina, we need to celebrate success, but we also need to honor Mr. Andre's request. We can not forget the people who are not yet home. All of the above-mentioned successes are great, but they mean less to American families who are still waiting to move home. Today, nearly 900 families who own homes are still living in FEMA trailers. More than 6,000 families own homes that they can not afford to rebuild. Rental prices have risen so that 49 percent of the population cannot afford the average cost of a home to rent. All too many family-centered neighborhoods now are pocked with blighted houses or vacant lots. As much as we would all like it to be, the recovery is not complete. That is where Saints quarterback Drew Breese and his war cry come in. To keep our pledge to Mr. Andre, all stakeholders -- Louisiana citizens, volunteers from around the world, corporations and local, state and federal government -- need to follow the command Breese made to his fellow Saints late last football season and \"finish strong.\" In football, finishing strong means playing hard through all four quarters and through every game of the season. In Louisiana's recovery, finishing strong means: . â¢ Governmental leadership that makes decisions that impact residents in ways that the leaders would want their own families to be impacted. â¢ Creating schools so that our community members' children are educated the way that we would want our children to be educated. â¢ Americans and corporations not viewing community as being limited by proximity and instead, like the hundreds of thousands of volunteers, working hard to help American families rebuild their homes. â¢ Understanding that the recovery is not complete until all residents are back in safe and humane homes. By following Breese's command, the Saints won the Super Bowl. By remembering Mr. Andre's words and by listening to Breese, we can win the recovery. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the co-authors.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Two additional homicide charges were announced Thursday against a suspected serial stabber who was trying to board an overseas flight when he was arrested, Michigan authorities said. Elias Abuelazam is a suspect in 18 stabbings in three states.  Five of the attacks were fatal -- all of those in Genesee County, Michigan, said the county's prosecutor, David Leyton. Four of the 18 attacks occurred in Ohio and Virginia. Abuelazam has been charged with homicide in three of the five deaths. Earlier, defense attorney Edwar Zeineh told CNN that he expected \"up to four new murder charges\" to be announced Thursday. However, Leyton said Thursday that the remaining cases are still under investigation. \"There is a lot we have to comb through,\" the prosecutor said. Previously, Abuelazam, 34, faced one murder count, five counts of assault with intent to commit murder and one charge of malicious destruction of property -- all related to attacks in Michigan. The new charges stem from separate fatal stabbings of two Michigan men, one 43 and another 60. In the first case, a witness identified Abuelazam as the stabber after seeing his photo on television, Leyton said. In the second, police obtained a search warrant for Abuelazam's luggage after he boarded a plane in Louisville, Kentucky, that was bound for Atlanta, Georgia. He was arrested August 11 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, where he was set to board a flight to Israel, police said. Investigators found a pair of sneakers in his baggage with evidence of blood matching the DNA of the 60-year-old victim, Leyton said. Abuelazam was indicted last week by a grand jury in Toledo, Ohio, in the stabbing of a church janitor. Zeineh said he does not believe investigators have insurmountable proof against his client. \"I still feel strongly there is reasonable doubt based on my review of the evidence so far,\" he said, without mentioning specifics. Abuelazam's mother recently flew from Israel to Flint, Michigan, to see her son, and has made several jailhouse visits. \"Her presence there as a mom was to empower her son,\" Zeineh said. \"She helped him gather his thoughts and be [a] productive member of his defense team.\" The three-state string of attacks began in May and ended in August. Most of the stabbing victims were African-American. Federal officials have not provided a motive for the attacks. Leesburg, Virginia, Police Chief Joseph Price has said he believed the attacker was targeting African-Americans. Abuelazam is believed responsible for three attacks in Leesburg. If convicted in Michigan, Abuelazam could face life in prison without parole. The state does not have the death penalty. Authorities had Abuelazam in custody twice in a two-week stretch, both within hours of reports of stabbings, but he was released. Police said he had not been linked to the attacks at the time. Abuelazam was arrested August 5 after a traffic stop and July 29 for allegedly providing alcohol to a minor. He was fined $125 in July. In the traffic stop arrest, in Arlington, Virginia, police arrested Abuelazam after learning he had an outstanding warrant for assault. A knife and hammer were found in his car. Authorities now believe both weapons were used in the string of stabbings. One of the attacks took place in Virginia hours after Abuelazam was released. CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.",

Poor nutrition is one of the main killers of young children, the U.N. Children's Fund says in the new report \"Tracking Progress on Child and Maternal Nutrition.\" \"The report we have launched draws attention to the fact that 200 million children under the age of 5 in the developing world suffer from chronic undernutrition,\" said Werner Schultink, UNICEF's associate director of nutrition. A lack of food can impair physical, mental and social abilities, the report says, adding that proper nutrition is important for mother and child. The 1,000 days from conception until a child's second birthday are the most critical for development, according to UNICEF. Undernourished children \"will perform less well in school, they will be able to do less well as an adult and, even worse, their health situation in adult life may be negatively affected,\" Schultink said. \"They are more likely to suffer from chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes.\" UNICEF says nutrition supplement programs have helped deliver vitamin A and iodized salt to vulnerable children in developing countries, boosting childhood mortality. Mothers also are being urged to breast-feed their children for at least the first six months to provide key antibodies and nutrients. Reducing and eliminating malnutrition is feasible, according to the report, which calls on the international community to provide urgent help or face the consequences. \"Global commitments on food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture are part of a wider agenda that will help address the critical issues raised in this report,\" said Ann Veneman, UNICEF's executive director. \"Unless attention is paid to addressing the causes of child and maternal undernutrition today, the costs will be considerably higher tomorrow.\"",

    "input": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- The British government announced Friday that more than 4,000 former Gurkha soldiers are entitled to settle in Britain, but Gurkha supporters quickly denounced the measure as meaningless. Former Gurkha solider Tulbahadur Pun was awarded Britain's highest honor for bravery, the Victoria Cross. Supporters have fought for years for more rights for the Gurkhas, Nepalese soldiers who have been part of the British Army for nearly 200 years. Gurkhas have fought alongside the British Armed Forces in every conflict in that period, including both world wars, and are known for their ferocity and pride. Despite their centuries of service, Gurkhas were not given the right to settle in the United Kingdom until 2004. And even then the order applied only to those discharged after the British handover of Hong Kong to China in 1997, when the Gurkhas Brigade moved from Hong Kong to Britain. The government's announcement Friday applies to all Gurkhas, including those who left the army before 1997, if they meet one of five criteria. It also says around 6,000 of the Gurkhas' dependents may be able to apply for settlement in Britain as well. \"The guidance honors the service, commitment, and gallantry of those who served with the Gurkhas Brigade,\" Border and Immigration Minister Phil Woolas said in a written statement. The Gurkha Justice Campaign, however, said the government's criteria for the Gurkhas' resettlement are unrealistic and too difficult for many of the soldiers to meet. \"Only a tiny fraction of the Gurkhas who retired before 1997 will win settlement rights under the new policy,\" the campaign said. \"The campaign for full Gurkha justice will now be taken back into Parliament and the courts. The government needs to know they will have a huge campaign against them who will commit to righting this wrong.\" The High Court ruled last September that the 1997 cut-off date was fair, but added that caseworkers needed revised guidance on deciding the cases of Gurkhas discharged before that date. Under the guidance, Gurkhas discharged before 1997 must meet one of five criteria to be considered for resettlement in Britain: . â¢ Have three years' continuous residence in Britain, before or after service; â¢ Have close family settled in the United Kingdom; â¢ Have an award for gallantry, leadership, or bravery while in the brigade; â¢ Have a chronic medical condition attributable to or made worse by army service; â¢ Have served for 20 or more years. Actress Joanna Lumley, whose father served in the Gurkhas while she was a girl, has been an outspoken campaigner for their rights. She said the new criteria are harsher than she expected. \"They've given five bullet points which virtually cannot be met by the ordinary Gurkha soldier,\" Lumley told reporters Friday. \"This one page of criteria has taken the government four months to come up with. It has made me ashamed of our administration.\" She said most Gurkhas are allowed to stay in the United Kingdom for only two years, so three years of continuous residence is not possible. Most Gurkhas, she said, also have not been allowed to settle in Britain with their families. The requirement for having won an award discriminates against the ordinary soldier who has no award, she said. \"This sends out not only to the Gurkha soldiers, but to our own men fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq, the most appalling message: that unless you have been awarded a medal for gallantry, you're not a real soldier,\" Lumley said. Only officers are allowed to serve 20 or more years, she said, so most riflemen will not qualify for the service requirement. And proving that an injury is related to army service will be nearly impossible for most, she said. \"How on earth are men who were injured in the 1940s, '50s, '60s going to be able to prove that their long-term chronic illness is attributable to injures received during their service?\" she said. A Home Office spokesman said the government believes hundreds of Gurkhas will still be eligible to settle in Britain. \"We would not accept that,\" the spokesman said of Lumley's criticisms. \"We would say that the criteria as we see it is fair and balanced.\" The Gurkha brigade originated in the 19th century with Nepalese soldiers who impressed British imperial troops with their ferocity and military ability. The first Gurkha units were formed in 1815. They saw action in both world wars and were fundamental to the British military maintaining control of India in the 1800s. Today there are 3,400 troops in the Gurkha brigade, operating from bases in Great Britain. Most recently, Gurkha troops were used in the Persian Gulf War and the Balkan conflicts.",

    "input": "New Haven, Connecticut (CNN) -- A man convicted of capital murder in a 2007 Connecticut home invasion has attempted suicide several times since his arrest and has said he wants to receive the death penalty, a forensic psychiatrist testified Wednesday. Steven Hayes, 47, was convicted this month of 16 of the 17 charges against him -- including nine counts of murder and capital murder and four counts of kidnapping -- in the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters, 17-year-old Hayley Petit and 11-year-old Michaela Petit. Prosecutors allege that Hayes and Joshua Komisarjevsky invaded the Petit home in Cheshire, beat Jennifer Hawke-Petit's husband bloody, strangled Hawke-Petit, set the house afire and tried to flee. On cross-examination, Dr. Paul Amble said his panel did not address the question of whether the defendant's suicide attempts were sincere. But in his opinion, Hayes was \"making decisions that were rational, given his situation\" when he said he wanted to receive the death penalty. \"I want to plead guilty to everything now, because I just want it over now,\" Hayes told an evaluation team, the assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine testified to a jury considering whether to sentence Steven Hayes to death. Hayes described a plan to \"look like a monster\" to the jury, expressing no remorse, in an attempt to move the jurors to sentence him to death, Amble wrote in his evaluation of the defendant. In March, Hayes told a psychologist that he no longer wanted to commit suicide \"but intended to let the state do it,\" Amble said. Judge Jon Blue had asked Amble to evaluate Hayes to determine whether he was competent to stand trial. Hayes \"described five overdose attempts\" that he felt Connecticut corrections staff was aware of, Amble said. The last such attempt came January 31, when Hayes \"took a fairly large amount of thorazine ... nearly twice the lethal limit,\" Amble said. The incident forced a delay in Hayes' trial, which had been set for February 1. Thorazine is an antipsychotic medication that can also be prescribed to treat anxiety, as it was in Hayes' case. Asked to describe his mood on a scale of zero to 10, Hayes ranked it at zero and described symptoms of helplessness and hopelessness since his arrest shortly after the killings, Amble testified. He said Hayes told him he had tried to strangle himself with a sock but failed because he couldn't tighten it enough to cut off circulation. Hayes told his evaluators that he had considered other ways to end his life, such as \"putting my head in the toilet and doing a back flip\" to break his neck, but opted against doing so out of fear that he might only paralyze or otherwise injure himself, according to the evaluation carried out by Amble. Hayes told the evaluation team in March that \"he wanted to essentially encourage the jury to vote in favor of the death penalty ... perhaps by taking the stand and looking like he has no remorse,\" Amble said. \"His desire was to actively seek the death penalty.\" He said Hayes has lost more than 60 pounds since his arrest and complained of not sleeping well and of nightmares. His psychiatrist in prison has diagnosed him with \"adjustment disorder\" and \"major depression,\" Amble said. Prosecutor Michael Dearington asked Amble whether Hayes truly wanted to be executed. \"I don't know,\" the doctor said. \"I'm not here to say I can exactly divine his thoughts, only what he said.\" Komisarjevsky is to be tried separately, but on Tuesday, a court clerk read from Komisarjevsky's writings providing graphic descriptions of the incident. \"I am what I am; I make no excuses,\" Komisarjevsky wrote. \"I'm a criminal with a criminal mind.\" But he also appeared to express remorse, at one point writing, \"Michaela, Haley and Jennifer, forgive me; I am damned. ... My forthcoming death sentence will be an action of mercy.\" Police testified that in the 2007 home invasion, Hayes and Komisarjevsky found evidence of a bank account containing $20,000 to $30,000 and forced Hawke-Petit to go to a bank in the morning and withdraw money from the account. Prosecutors said Hayes took her to the bank while Komisarjevsky stayed behind. When Hayes and Hawke-Petit returned with the money, officials said, the two men set the home afire and fled. Inside the home, authorities said, Hawke-Petit, 48, was found raped and strangled. Her two daughters, one of whom had been sexually assaulted, died of smoke inhalation. Petit, the sole survivor, escaped to a neighbor's home. Amble was the only witness to testify on Wednesday, and no further testimony is scheduled until Monday, after the judge and attorneys spend the rest of this week working on jury instructions. .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A prominent supporter of Sen. Barack Obama on Wednesday compared Bill Clinton's appeals for his wife, Sen. Hillary Clinton, in South Carolina to the tactics used by a former Republican strategist that are infamous within Democratic circles. Former President Bill Clinton responds to a reporter who asked him about criticism from the Obama campaign. When asked about the comparison, the former president reacted with disapproval, saying it was a distraction from what voters really cared about. In an interview with CNN, Dick Harpootlian, a former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party and an Obama backer, said some of Clinton's recent remarks on the campaign trail were appeals based on race and gender, meant to \"suppress the vote, demoralize voters and distort the record.\" Harpootlian said the remarks were \"reminiscent of Lee Atwater,\" a hard-hitting Republican strategist who worked for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush and whose tactics were reviled by many Democrats. Atwater died in 1991. When CNN's Jessica Yellin asked Clinton about Harpootlian's comments, Clinton disputed the charge and lashed out, saying: \"You live for this. This hurts the people of South Carolina.\"  Watch Clinton rebuke the media Â» . \"Because the people of South Carolina come to these meetings and ask questions about what they care about, \" he said. \"And what they care about is not what's going to be in the news coverage tonight, because you don't care about it.\" \"What you care about is this. And the Obama people know that. So they just spin you up on this and you happily go along,\" Clinton told Yellin. \"And that's not right. That is not right. This election ought to belong to those people who are out here asking questions about their lives.\" The former president's angry response comes just days before the South's first Democratic contest on Saturday and is the latest in a series of heated exchanges between the Obama and Clinton camps. Sen. Hillary Clinton is focusing her attention on states with contests next month on \"Super Tuesday,\" leaving the campaigning for this week's South Carolina primary to her husband. South Carolina's primary is the Democrats' last big contest before Super Tuesday on February 5, when two dozen states hold primaries or caucuses. The senator from New York is zigzagging across the country, while Bill Clinton makes the rounds in South Carolina and doubles up the attacks on Obama. Obama sees his rival's absence as a good thing, according to Christian Broadcasting Network correspondent David Brody, who interviewed the senator from Illinois on Tuesday. \"He believes that it is a sign, in essence, the fact that she's leaving the state -- that that bodes well for him,\" Brody said. \"He was talking about the fact that she had said that ... he's not running against Bill Clinton. But then, at the same time, Bill Clinton is here in South Carolina by proxy, running against Barack Obama down here in South Carolina.\" The 42nd president has been immersed in the intense, back-and-forth exchanges between his wife and Obama, who said this week in a debate in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, that he sometimes can't tell which one he's running against in the race. The former president has attacked Obama in recent days, accusing him of overstating his opposition to the Iraq war, complaining about Obama's union supporters in the Nevada caucuses last weekend and blasting his remarks on former President Reagan in a newspaper interview.  Watch the battle brewing between the Clintons and Obama Â» . Clinton on Wednesday tried to distance himself from the attacks, telling a CNN correspondent that the rhetoric was \"crazy\" and \"getting a little carried away.\" But earlier in the day, the Clinton campaign launched a radio ad in South Carolina that takes another jab at Obama, highlighting some of his recent comments on the Republican Party. The ad plays a portion of his interview with the Reno Journal-Gazette in which Obama said in part, \"The Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years.\" The ad's narrator asks, \"Really? Aren't those the ideas that got us into the economic mess we're in today? Ideas like special tax breaks for Wall Street?\" The narrator goes on to say, \"Running up a $9 trillion debt. Refusing to raise the minimum wage or deal with the housing crisis. Are those the ideas Barack Obama's talking about?\" Obama's campaign has said the Clintons are mischaracterizing his comments, and Obama spokesman Bill Burton called it a \"negative, dishonest attack.\"  Watch what the exchanges could mean for the election Â» . \"The fact that Hillary Clinton has praised Ronald Reagan and supported some of the very worst Republican ideas just underscores that she will say or do anything to get elected,\" Burton said. CNN political analyst Gloria Borger said the Clintons \"know exactly what they are doing.\" \"This may be a very smart political strategy for them. They've gotten Obama a little bit off his game right now because he's busy responding to Bill Clinton, and that's not what he wanted to be doing,\" Borger said. E-mail to a friend .

    "input": "(CNN) -- Brazil \"will not bend\" to U.S. pressure to seek sanctions against Iran, Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim said after a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in Brasilia. The United States was seeking support for sanctions against Iran, which it accuses of harboring a non-peaceful nuclear program. Brazil shares the table with the United States on the United Nations Security Council, where it holds a non-veto seat. \"We think with our own mind. We want a world without nuclear arms, certainly without proliferation,\" Amorim said at a news conference with Clinton on Wednesday, according to the official Agencia Brasil news agency. \"It is not about simply bending to an opinion that may not be true. We can't simply be taken along. We have to think with our own head.\" During her remarks, Clinton reiterated the case for new sanctions, saying that Iran is not likely to engage in negotiations over its nuclear program until after sanctions are in place. Clinton said Iran is trying to stall the international community. Amorim countered that there is still time for negotiations, and that a uranium swap deal remains a possibility. The United States is proposing tough new sanctions on Iran at the U.N. Security Council in an effort to persuade Iran to stop uranium enrichment and negotiate with world powers over its nuclear program, senior U.S. officials and Security Council diplomats said. The United States and its allies are discussing the measures as part of a possible fourth Security Council resolution against Iran over its nuclear program. The sanctions focus on the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps, which has vast business interests in the country. The sanctions would center around the banking, shipping and insurance sectors of the Iranian economy, broadening the scope of the sanctions in the three previous U.N. security resolutions. While existing sanctions call on U.N. members to exercise \"vigilance\" or \"restraint\" on trade, the sources said the proposed new sanctions call for an outright ban on certain transactions with Iran. The proposed measures expand existing areas of sanctions, adding new companies and additional individuals facing a travel ban and assets freeze for their work on Iran's nuclear program. The United States wants to gain the support of Russia and China to negotiate the proposed sanctions draft. The United States and its allies hope that China will voice its support in talks with Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg in Beijing this week.

    "input": "(CNN) -- A co-founder of the National Necrotizing Fasciitis Foundation said Thursday that she felt sorry for the young woman diagnosed with rare \"flesh-eating\" bacterial infection when she heard about her this week in media reports. \"First thing I thought when I saw the news was, 'Oh, how tragic, another case!'\" said Jacqueline Roemmele in a telephone interview about the first report of Aimee Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate student at West Georgia University who had lost a leg and was expected to lose her fingers to the infection. Though there is uncertainty about just how common such infections are since no clearinghouse compiles statistics on their incidence, Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the Department of Preventive Medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, estimates there are fewer than 250 cases every year in the United States. The reporting of such cases is not required by law. Flesh-eating bacteria explained . \"I get e-mails about these cases every single day,\" said Roemmele, who noted that news coverage of such cases is far rarer than the infections themselves are. \"If you look at our foundation and our Facebook page, there's discussion constantly among thousands of people, but it just isn't sexy for the media.\" Still, this week's TV and print pieces about Copeland did not surprise Roemmele. \"It was a cute girl that everyone can relate to,\" she said. In addition, Copeland's relatives have made themselves available to reporters and her classmates have been vocal in their support. Copeland 'in high spirits,' father says . \"Every three or four years or so it happens, where a case will take off in the media,\" said Roemmele, who is based in northern New Jersey. But Roemmele said she was grateful for the coverage, whatever the motivation. Not only has her foundation received a \"substantial\" increase in donations since the cases went public, but the stories may have some educational value. If people seek quicker treatment next time they get a cut that results in a rapidly spreading infection, causes pain disproportionate to the size of the cut and is associated with flulike symptoms, then the goals of her group will be furthered, she said. Group A streptoccal bacteria, the same bacteria that cause strep throat, are the main culprits, although -- as occurred in Copeland's case -- other bacteria can also result in the disease, known to doctors as necrotizing fasciitis, Roemmele said. \"You're fine when you go to bed at night, but you wake up in the morning with your leg twice the size and turning black and you have a 105 or above fever,\" she said. \"I've known many, many cases where people have died within 24 hours.\" Roemmele herself survived the infection. \"Eighteen years ago, I had a surgery on my abdomen after a C-section for my twins,\" she said. \"By the time they finally found out what was wrong with me, my flesh was falling off in the nurse's hands.\" South Carolina woman 'very ill, but stable' After recovering, she and a fellow survivor founded the website. In the 12 years since, tens of thousands of people have told their stories on the site about the disease, she said. \"I'm happy to see that it's again getting some attention,\" she said. \"The biggest problem we have is missed diagnosis. That's huge. So, if somebody goes into the ER, invariably they're turned away. By the time they go back, they've reached the advanced stages of the disease and they're either losing limbs or losing their lives.\" That comes close to describing what happened to Dan Coogan. In 1995, the 41-year-old triathlete was gardening in his yard outside Dallas. As he set about transplanting a tree, he lifted its 2-inch trunk, which was attached to a 2-foot-wide root ball. \"One of the roots poked me in my calf, and I didn't even know it,\" he said. \"Within an hour, I felt like I had a Charlie horse. By the end of the day, I was vomiting all the time. I felt like I had the flu. I had a fever. I went to bed sicker than a dog.\" A few hours later, at 4 a.m., his house was struck by lightning and caught fire. As firefighters arrived and extinguished it, \"I could barely walk around because of the pain in my leg,\" he said. He went back to bed, in worsening pain. \"I just started popping a lot more painkillers.\" At 10 a.m., with his cut growing fiery, he went to a small regional hospital in nearby Lewisville. \"They checked me in and didn't do anything for two days\" except administer antibiotics, he said. By then, \"this thing had taken over the backside of my leg and was more than halfway up my thigh.\" His luck turned when a friend, who happened to be a surgeon, recognized that something was awry and arranged for his transfer to another hospital, where doctors immediately recognized the symptoms. \"Within an hour of checking into that hospital, I was in surgery,\" he said. Each night for nearly two weeks, he underwent operations that included removal of the infected tissue and dead flesh. \"They told me every night for nine nights that they were going to take my leg off,\" he said. But one of the doctors put it off, saying \"I'm going to take a chance here,\" he recalled. \"She was right, thank goodness. I made it through all the surgeries and debridement (tissue removal) and living on morphine for 2ÃÂ½ weeks ... I was able to survive the whole thing and I walked out of the hospital.\" But his case, like most of the others he had learned about, generated no interest from the news media. \"The people who get it aren't 24 and grad students,\" he said, referring to Copeland. \"And she's got a community of other students. ... The press has kinda glamorized this one.\"",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- To hear Paul Ryan explain it, there's just one way to cope with becoming the Democrats' favorite man to hate: \"I gave fear up for Lent this year,\" Ryan told CNN during an extensive interview. And he's not kidding. It's probably a good idea, given the fact that Ryan's budget -- passed nearly unanimously by House Republicans -- has become the GOP Holy Grail. It includes entitlement cuts, most notably the gradual shifting of Medicare into a program dominated by private insurers. It's no surprise, then, that Democrats call it dangerous, mean and reckless -- and that's not all. \"The Ryan road map is the way to the cliff and then over the cliff,\" said Rep. John Yarmuth. D-Kentucky. \"The Ryan proposal would destroy our government,\" economist and Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs declared at a Democratic Progressive Caucus event. Ryan remains undeterred. \"There's a big test to this country and whether we apply our country's principles -- you know liberty, free enterprise, self-determination, government by the consent of the governed -- all of these really core principles are being tested right now,\" Ryan told CNN. \"You can't have fear if you try to fix these problems.\" The 41-year-old Ryan has been on a fast track. First elected to Congress in 1998 after a stint as a congressional staffer and adviser at the conservative think tank Empower America, the Janesville, Wisconsin, native ran for the House at the ripe old age of 28. It was a long shot, but he won, convincingly. Always a fiscal conservative, Ryan made his mark delving into the nuance of federal budgets. Now he's become famous as the face of a new brand of Republican economics -- one that includes the most sweeping plan to cut government spending in decades and enact major entitlement reforms. As evidence of his growing influence in the party, the Republican National Committee on Friday tapped Ryan to be its Presidential Trust Chairman to lead its fundraising effort against President Barack Obama. Ryan had the deficit in his sights for years. At first, even Republicans steered clear of some of his more controversial budget ideas like Medicare reform. But then the economy went south and the tea party became the rage. Suddenly, the push to slash budget deficits became popular. So popular, in fact, that Ryan's budget outline overwhelmingly passed the Republican-controlled House in the spring. It cuts $6.2 trillion over 10 years in federal government spending. That's big bucks, and Ryan does it by gradually transforming Medicare into a program in which recipients receive vouchers to help buy private insurance. He also gradually raises the program's eligibility age and transforms Medicaid into a block grant program. On the tax side, the Ryan plan includes major tax reform that reduces the top rate for both individuals and corporations. The plan died in the Senate and handed the Democrats a political issue. \"...His budget would kill people. No question,\" Princeton University and Nobel Prize -inning economist Paul Krugman told CNN. \"The cuts in Medicare he's proposing, the replacement of Medicare by a voucher system would in the end mean that tens of millions of Americans would not be able to afford essential health care. So that counts as cruelty to me.\" Ryan scoffs at the criticism. \"There's sort of a shoot-the-messenger strategy these days,\" he added. \"I'm the messenger, and you can't fear that if you are who you are.\" It's a pattern for Ryan, who has grown in popularity by pushing the unpopular, a fairly unconventional route. Not only has he proposed major reforms in entitlements; he's also tried to end his colleagues' pork projects. When he became chairman of the House Budget Committee this year after Republicans captured control of the House, he continued to touch the untouchable-- the third rail of American politics. \"I used to say I'm like a koala bear grabbing on. So here's the problem: if you don't address these issues now, they're going to steamroll us as a country, and the issue the more you delay fixing these problems, the much uglier the solutions are going to be,\" he told CNN. \"Fifty-one percent of Medicare right now is funded with borrowed money, and so if we're going to keep the promise, you have to change it for our generation. You have to change it for those of us in the X Generation that won't have a program when we retire.\" It's become the mantra of the GOP, including presidential candidates. So when former House Speaker Newt Gingrich criticized Ryan's plan as \"right-wing social engineering,\" in a television appearance in May, it created an immediate furor. Gingrich was forced to take the comments back. He called Ryan within days to say he was wrong and misspoke, according to Ryan. Apology accepted. The other GOP candidates have supported his ideas -- although with some nuances, because the notion of changing entitlements is a controversial proposition for a presidential candidate. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has not backed away from his comments calling Social Security a \"Ponzi scheme,\" said he and Ryan talked recently about the program and the need to reform it. Speaking at an Iowa event, Perry said he told Ryan, \"'hank you for having the courage to stand up and being, talking about this,' and I said, 'I am proud to join you in this discussion with America for clearly calling the Social Security program that we have in place today broken.'\" Last week on Laura Ingraham's radio show, Ryan said he didn't think the program is a criminal enterprise but is operating like a Ponzi scheme. \"It's a pay-as-you-go system where earlier investors, or, say, taxpayers, get a positive rate of return... and later investors, or taxpayers, get a negative rate of return,\" he said, according to a partial transcript. \"And so ... that is how those schemes work. The point is, unless you fix this problem, it's going to get much worse.\" And how would Ryan make Social Security financially sustainable? By gradually raising the eligibility age, tying the benefits for more wealthy recipients to inflation and offering workers under the age of 55 the option of investing some of their taxes into personal retirement accounts. Say what you will about Ryan's willingness to take on sacrificial lambs, he is not shy about pushing controversial proposals -- and that's a rarity in Washington. \"He is a guy without guile, without pretense. He likes to hang out with actuaries for relaxation,\" conservative commentator and CNN analyst Bill Bennett said in an interview. Ryan worked for Bennett at Empower America. And there's more to Ryan than the D.C. wonk. He's also a hunter who can target elk with a bow and arrow. And he's an exercise buff -- when in Washington, he works out each morning with some of his congressional colleagues using a grueling fitness routine called P90X. One favorite pastime: trekking the Colorado Rockies. His devotion to fitness was spurred by the early death of his father at age 55 when Ryan was 16. \"I basically had to learn to sink and swim,\" he recalled. \"I did a lot of growing up very fast. And it made me take stock of who I am, what kind of person I want to be. It made me, I would say, very initiative-prone -- live life to its fullest because you never know how long it is going to last.\" Ryan was pushed again this summer to run for the Republican presidential nomination by assorted GOP luminaries. His answer: No, not yet. \"I think there are other good people who can do this job,\" he told CNN. \"But there are not other good people who can raise my kids.\" -- CNN's Katie Ross and Eric Marrapodi contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Chelsea have completed the English Premier League and FA Cup double for the first time in their history after a hard-fought 1-0 cup final win over Portsmouth at Wembley Stadium on Saturday. In a topsy-turvy match, which saw two penalties missed in a frantic second-half, Didier Drogba's superb long-range free-kick eventually proved the difference, as both sides wasted a host of chances to find the net. In a strange twist of fate, the final was played between the last two winners of the competition -- Portsmouth (2008) and Chelsea (2009) -- but the similarity between the two sides ended there. Chelsea had sealed the Premier League title with an 8-0 thrashing of Wigan last weekend, while Portsmouth had suffered a dreadful season in which they became the first Premier League club to enter administration after accumulating huge debts -- subsequently finishing bottom of the table and suffering relegation to the second tier Championship. And that gulf in class between the sides showed in the opening 45 minutes, with Chelsea remarkably hitting the woodwork five times as they peppered the Portsmouth goal. The most glaring miss came from Ivory Coast striker Salomon Kalou, who somehow contrived to hit the crossbar with an open goal gaping, after being superbly set-up by left-back Ashley Cole. Frank Lampard's dipping long-range strike and John Terry's looping header also struck the woodwork, while Drogba gave notice of what was to come in the second half with a stunning free-kick, which England goalkeeper David James somehow managed to get a fingertip to, with the ball bouncing onto the goalline and away. Portsmouth themselves had a great opportunity in the first half, when Frederic Piquionne diverted a cross goalbound, only for goalkeeper Petr Cech to instinctively scramble the ball clear. Underdogs Portsmouth began the second half with more purpose and should have taken a surprise lead. Aruna Dindane out-paced substitute Julian Belletti, who had come on for the injured Michael Ballack, and was fouled by the Brazilian in the penalty area. However, Kevin-Prince Boateng's weak spot-kick was hit straight down the middle, allowing Cech to save with his legs. And Portsmouth were made to play for that miss just two minutes later when Drogba found a gap in the Portsmouth wall to fire his free-kick into the far corner of James' net. Chelsea squandered further chances to double their lead, most notably when Frank Lampard missed the game's second penalty four minutes from the end after Lampard himself had been fouled by Michael Brown. However, Portsmouth failed to trouble Cech's goal after that, although substitute Nadir Belhadj produced a couple of dangerous crosses from the left that caused panic in the Chelsea defence. After the game, Chelsea captain John Terry paid tribute to his side, who join Tottenham (1961), Liverpool (1986), Arsenal (1971, 1998, 2002) and Manchester United (1994, 1996 and 1999) as modern-day \"Double\" winners. \"This is an unbelievable feeling and to win the Double with this group of players is just fantastic,\" Terry told ITV Sport. \"I thought our luck was running out with all those misses but it was a great strike from Didier and I thought we were worthy winners. \"The pitch was awful, the worse pitch we have played on this season, but we played our football and managed to get the victory.\" The result was also a personal triumph for manager Carlo Ancelotti, who managed to achieve what no other Chelsea manager -- including Jose Mourinho -- had achieved by winning the \"Double\" in his first season in charge at Stamford Bridge.",

    "input": "(Mashable) -- It'd be an understatement to say that this has been a terrible week for Apple, and we haven't even reached the halfway point. On Monday, Consumer Reports dealt a devastating blow to the iPhone 4 when it declined to recommend the device to consumers due to the antenna reception problem. Consumer Reports concluded from its tests that cell reception is indeed lost if you cover up the small gap between the two metal bands on the bottom left corner (as it's facing you) of the phone. The media quickly picked up the story. Tuesday wasn't any better for the tech giant. Consumer Reports slammed Apple for not providing a fix to customers at no extra cost. Some have even suggested that a recall was imminent -- an endeavor that would cost the company $1.5 billion. All of this news resulted in a sharp dive in Apple's stock price, although it has since made a partial recovery. There are even class action lawsuits waiting in the wings. Apple has a nightmare on its hands, and no software fix will make the problem go away. The issue has taken on a life of its own. The situation isn't impossible for Apple to recover from, though. However, the company needs to take action, and it needs to do it quick. Here are what my top five priorities would be if I were in Steve Jobs' shoes: . 1. Acknowledge that the antenna problem is real . While you can't call the data conclusive, you can say that the data overwhelmingly points to one conclusion: the iPhone has an antenna problem. The iPhone antenna issue has been replicated in countless YouTube videos and by multiple media organizations, including us. Apple's internal documents show that they know the issue is real. This is almost certainly a hardware issue, and it's time that Apple stopped being coy and just admit that the phone does have an issue with its reception. The current string of denials and half-truths won't have any legs as the pressure mounts and the lawyers come knocking. The best thing the company can do is issue an open letter on the antenna issue, ideally from Steve Jobs himself. The key to making this go away is transparency. 2. Go into the technical details . Once Apple acknowledges the problem, it needs to give up details, such as the science behind the antenna issue, why the company didn't catch it during testing, and different potential fixes. Don't spare the public the complicated and scientific issues behind the iPhone's design and how different grips affect reception -- anything less won't appease a critical public. 3. Roll out the software update . Apple has promised a software update earlier this month to \"fix\" the formula used to calculate signal bar strength display, which the company pointed to as the root of the iPhone antenna problem. While we believe that the software fix was meant to be a decoy to the real hardware issue, the company has already committed to the software update, and it should roll it out as promised. Don't keep trying to point to software as the problem, though: most people are aware that it's not a software bug causing the antenna issue and treating it as such is just demeaning and condescending to iPhone users everywhere. 4. Make the bumpers free . Out of all of my suggestions, this one is the key. Those iPhone bumpers may cost $29.00 in the Apple Store, but in reality the rubber and plastic mold only costs a fraction of that price (possibly around $1 per bumper). Providing that accessory to customers for free solves the antenna issue, as bare skin has to touch the iPhone 4's metal casing in order to drop signal. It's not an ideal fix, but it's far better than the other option: a recall. 5. No matter what, don't issue an iPhone 4 recall . Some have suggested that Apple should recall the iPhone 4. That isn't a simple affair. In fact, most users would be more annoyed and upset than pleased with the Cuptertino-based company. Let's play out the scenario. Apple performs a recall of its devices. Millions of people are annoyed as they either have to give up their device or keep a clearly defective one. Apple, already at peak production capacity, would take weeks -- if not months -- to replace the phones. Estimates place the cost of a recall in the billions. Here's the truth: The iPhone 4 antenna issue isn't a hazardous one. It isn't exploding in people's hands, it isn't cutting anyone's palms randomly, and it isn't suddenly bursting into flames. Those are critical issues that would require a recall. The antenna issue, while important and a problem that Apple should have found and addressed before the product's launch last month, doesn't rise to that level. Recalls are meant only as a last resort. Do you think Ford is going to recall all of its cars for a faulty radio? Apple, while it may be feeling the pressure, can't cave to it. There is a balance here. It has to be truthful with what's actually wrong with the iPhone antenna and what is not. It has to keep its emotions in check as it discusses the antenna independent of the iPhone 4's many other amazing features. And finally, the company has to give customers something to solve the issue. Free bumpers seem like the appropriate middle ground. A recall is over-the-top extreme and hurts rather than helps consumers in the end. Â© 2010 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The King is dead -- or so they say, even though his original crypt is empty. And one person could soon own the place that served as Elvis Presley's first, but not final, resting place, by being the highest bidder. Starting the middle of next month, Julien's Auctions of Beverly Hills, California, will conduct the sale of the crypt, which is part of a large granite and marble mausoleum at Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee. This is no fleeting prize: The winner or their loved one can be interred for all of eternity exactly where Presley and his mother were for about two months. Unless conspiracy theorists are to be believed -- in which case a 77-year-old Presley may be still snacking on peanut butter, banana and bacon sandwiches on some secluded isle -- the late legendary singer is currently buried in the meditation garden at Graceland, his Memphis estate. Presley purchased that home and its 14 acres in 1957, a few years after his career had taken off. In his career, he sold more than a billion records, starred in 33 films, captured 14 Grammy nominations and earned the moniker \"The King of Rock 'n' Roll,\" not to mention the adoration of hundreds of thousands of rabid fans, according to his official biography. It was in a bathroom of his Graceland mansion that Presley was found dead August 16, 1977, due to what authorities said was an irregular heartbeat. But after 200 friends and relatives attended his funeral there two days later, he had to leave -- his body was moved about five miles south to Forest Hill Cemetery. His father, Vernon, wanted to bury Elvis at Graceland, but needed time for the state of Tennessee to grant permission to bury a person on private grounds, according to the Julien's Auctions website. Until then, the late singer was put in the crypt at the Memphis cemetery, soon joined by his mother -- Vernon's widow, Gladys Presley -- who also was disinterred and put in the same mausoleum vault. The bodies of both son and mother were moved within two months to Graceland, where visitors pay their respects to them to this day. As to Elvis's original crypt, it has remained empty since the King left the mausoleum, marked by a statue commemorating his weeks there. The lot up for auction includes Presley's original crypt, the chance to open and close the vault and crypt for burial, an inscription and the use of a small, abutting chapel for a committal service, Julien's Auctions notes. Those wishing to purchase this eternal piece of music history can't come empty-handed: Bids start at $100,000.",

Detectives with the city's violent crimes section met with the lawyer for Rios Thursday morning to obtain a copy of the video, attorney Mark Haushalter said. The video shows James confronting Rios, who is sitting in a vehicle park across the street from West Coast Choppers, a business owned by James, Haushalter said. Two tires on the SUV were slashed, a door was dented and a window was scratched, he said. The lawyer for James did not immediately respond to CNN requests for comment.",

Joshua French and Tjostolv Moland have been sentenced to death and have five days to appeal. Asked about the sentence, Lambert Mende Omalanga, Congo's minister of communications, told CNN, \"We don't have a habit of commenting on judicial decisions.\" However, Omalanga said, his country has not carried out the death penalty in 10 years. He said lawmakers in parliament are in the process of trying to take the law off the books. A military court in Kisangani found Tjostolv Moland, 28, and Joshua French, 27, guilty on all charges, Norwegian TV2 reported. The court also ordered the pair to pay $60 million in damages. The men have five days to appeal their sentence, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN. It was not clear why the men were in Congo. \"I have earlier made absolutely clear that these two have not been conducting business for Norway in any shape or form,\" Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Store told Norwegian state television NRK after the verdict. \"We will now read through the sentence to see exactly how it is written,\" Store added. Norwegian authorities have been following the trial closely on television, and have tried to keep a balance between respecting the judicial system of a different country and helping Norwegian citizens in trouble, Store told NRK. The two men were found guilty of spying for Norway and for killing a driver in May, according to NRK. In an earlier statement on the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Web site, the ministry said that if the two Norwegians were to receive the death penalty, Norwegian authorities would immediately try to seek assurances from Congolese authorities that the death sentence would not be carried out. \"Norway has a very strong stand on the death penalty, and we are very much against it,\" a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman told CNN. Images on NRK TV showed that after the sentence against the two men was read, applause broke out in the courtroom. CNN's Deb Krajnak contributed to this report.",

    "input": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Dancing in public is not allowed in Iran, but thousands could hardly contain themselves at a recent presidential campaign rally in the capital city, Tehran. Supporters hope Zahra Rahnavard will become Iran's future first lady. On this day, the deafening cheers were not for presidential hopeful Mir Hossein Mousavi, but rather for his wife -- a woman some are calling Iran's Michelle Obama. The comparisons to the first lady of the United States stem from the role Zahra Rahnavard is playing in her husband's quest for the presidency. Never in the history of Iranian presidential elections has a candidate put his wife in the forefront of his campaign. Wherever Mousavi -- a centrist candidate -- goes, Rahnavard is usually nearby.  Watch more about Zahra Rahnavard Â» . \"We look at her and we say, 'we want to be like her in the future, ' \" said Shakiba Shakerhosseie, one of 12,000 people who packed into Tehran's indoor Azadi (Freedom) sports stadium to hear Rahnavard speak. Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was forced into exile. The revolution also ended the ceremonial role of first lady that the last queen, Farah, enjoyed. At this rally, Rahnavard -- a writer and art professor -- spoke for her husband, who was campaigning elsewhere. Wearing a floral headscarf and a traditional black chador -- a full-length loose robe that women in Iran wear like a cloak -- Rahnavard called for freedoms she says were lost during President Mahmoud Ahmadijenad's term. \"I hope freedom of speech, freedom of the pen and freedom of thought will not be forgotten,\" she said. The crowd, which was clad in Mousavi's trademark color green, cheered wildly. It waved placards with his picture and swayed from side to side, chanting and beating drums. The women sat on one side; the men on the other. The overwhelming majority were young voters, many of whom said they attended because of Mousavi's wife, a mother of three. Iran's population -- estimated at more than 66 million -- has a median age of 27. \"I am really angry here in Iran with the position of women,\" said Saghar Kouhestani, adding that she supports Mousavi because of his wife. Mousavi, a former prime minister, is considered a threat to Ahmadinejad, a hard-liner, in the June 12 elections. He is credited for successfully navigating the Iranian economy during a bloody eight-year war with Iraq in the 1980s. Over the weekend, the Iranian government blocked access to the social networking site Facebook, where Mousavi has a page with more than 5,000 supporters, the semi-official Iranian Labor News Agency (ILNA) said. Those attempting to visit Facebook received a message in Farsi saying, \"Access to this site is not possible.\" Political science professor Mohammad Marandi downplays Rahnavard's impact. She may win over reformists and women, he says, but what will win the election is a solution to the floundering economy and a strong performance in the debates. \"If Ahmadinejad does well in the debates, I don't think anyone will be able to defeat him,\" Marandi said. But try selling that to Rahnavard's enthusiastic supporters. \"This is the first time after the Revolution we see a lady behind the president,\" said Farhad Mahmoudi. \"And this is why we're so happy because we can have a first lady.\"",

The latest International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species states that the wild population of the two-horned antelope species now stands at around 1,000, nearly 40 years after the last wild animal was hunted and killed. \"To have brought the Arabian Oryx back from the brink of extinction is a major feat, one which we hope will be repeated many times over for other threatened species,\" said Razan Khalifa Al Mubarak, Director General of the Environment Agency -- Abu Dhabi. The species is now listed as \"vulnerable\" and is the first time an animal listed as \"extinct in the wild\" has improved its status by three categories. The turn-around has been the result of conservation efforts that began in 1982 in Oman. Captive bred oryx were successfully released back into the desert habitats of the country and then in regions of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Israel and Jordan. Known locally as Al Maha, the Arabian Oryx is thought to be uniquely adapted to living in harsh, dry environments with its ability to smell water from miles away. It is thought that it was also the source of the unicorn legend, as when viewed in profile the two horns appear as one. The latest published findings from the IUCN Red List also have new additions to the ranks of endangered and threatened species. Eight new species of amphibians are classified as critically endangered, just one place from \"extinct in the wild.\" The IUCN says that amphibians are one of the most threatened species groups with an estimated 41% at risk of extinction. The main threats come from habitat loss, pollution, diseases and invasive species.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Three American college students detained in Cairo since Monday night were released from police custody Friday and were headed to the airport to return to the United States, an attorney for one of the men said. The men will board three separate commercial flights to return home, according to Joy Sweeney, the mother of Derrik Sweeney. Theodore Simon, an attorney for the family of Gregory Porter, told CNN that \"his parents anxiously await his return.\" The three -- Porter, Sweeney and Luke Gates -- were arrested after being accused of throwing Molotov cocktails in the unrest that has rattled the country since last week. Their release was ordered Thursday. Joy Sweeney said earlier Friday that the paperwork to release the men had been completed. Derrik Sweeney's father, Kevin Sweeney, told CNN his flight is scheduled to leave Cairo at 10:30 a.m. Saturday (3:30 a.m. ET) and he will arrive in his home state of Missouri on Saturday night. \"He's extremely excited,\" Kevin Sweeney said of his son. The family was planning to hold a belated Thanksgiving meal Sunday. Joy Sweeney said her son told her Wednesday in a telephone call that \"they had done nothing wrong.\" All had been attending American University in Cairo on a semester-long, study-abroad program. Sweeney, 19, is a Georgetown University student from Jefferson City, Missouri; Porter, 19, is from Glenside, Pennsylvania, and attends Drexel University in Philadelphia; and Gates, 21, of Bloomington, Indiana, goes to Indiana University. Adel Saeed, the general prosecutor's spokesman, said Wednesday that a bag filled with empty bottles, a bottle of gasoline, a towel and a camera had been found with the three American students. \"They denied the bag belonged to them and said it belonged to two of their friends,\" Saeed said. Kevin Sweeney said Friday that his son had been \"falsely accused.\" \"He was there observing something that was definitely a phenomenon of the culture,\" he said, noting that Derrik, with a dual major in Arabic and psychology, had gone to Egypt \"not just to learn the language -- he wanted to learn the culture.\" Now, Sweeney said, his son does not plan to return to Egypt. \"This semester is over for him, whether he's able to finish it remotely or writes it off,\" he said. \"He really does not want to be in Egypt right now.\" Sweeney declined to discuss any possible injuries his son sustained while in police custody. He was not aware of the conditions of the other two men. Also Friday, an Egyptian-American filmmaker arrested amid ongoing protests in Cairo was released, her lawyer said. There were no immediate details about the release of documentarian Jehane Noujaim, which was confirmed by her lawyer, Ragia Omran.

    "input": "London, England (CNN) -- British Airways said its operations got off to a good start Saturday despite a second consecutive strike by thousands of its cabin crew members. The airline said it was able to operate flights as normal at two London airports, Gatwick and City, and that the number of crew members reporting for work at Heathrow -- Britain's busiest airport -- was enough to operate its planned schedule. \"We have got off to a good start,\" the airline said in a statement. The crews walked out at midnight Friday in a strike set to last for four days. They staged a three-day walkout last weekend. BA said enough staff had crossed the picket lines that it was able to fly more than 75 percent of customers scheduled to travel during the strike. Another 18 percent of passengers are booked to fly on other carriers or have changed their travel dates to avoid the strike. Are you worried about the strike? The Unite union, which represents 95 percent of BA's 15,000 cabin crew, said it was too early say how many crew members worked despite the strike. At Heathrow's Terminal 5, which is used primarily by British Airways, things appeared to be running smoothly Saturday and long-haul passengers who spoke to CNN seemed largely unaffected. \"It's been fine from Seattle, (Washington) and I hope it will be fine going back to Seattle,\" passenger Don Dewar said. Ravi Erukulabatn said his mother-in-law was still scheduled to fly to Hyderabad, India. \"She is flying on her own, so we were a bit anxious to begin with, bur fortunately it is happening as expected,\" he told CNN. The airline said it will be able to run a full operation from London's Gatwick and City airports. At Heathrow, BA will be able to run up to 55 percent of its short-haul flights and up to 70 percent of its long-haul flights, the airline said. To help operate as many flights as possible, BA is leasing planes, pilots and crews from six airlines, BA said. It is also using volunteers from other areas of the company to stand in for striking cabin crew. BA handed a statement to passengers on some long-haul flights, reassuring them the airline's own staff was working on board. \"British Airways pilots will be flying your aircraft and you will be cared for in the cabin by British Airways staff,\" the statement read. \"Some of these staff in the cabin may be additional pilots who have volunteered to look after you, and as such will be wearing their pilot uniforms.\" Pauline Doyle, a spokeswoman for Unite, said having pilots standing in as flight attendants \"undermines\" the relationship between cabin crew and pilots. BA Chief Executive Willie Walsh had threatened last week to take away the travel perks, which might have been one reason some union staff agreed to work despite the strike last weekend. Striking staff stripped of perks . He said the travel perks are not in the crews' contracts and can be withdrawn at the airline's discretion. The union representing the striking workers called the move \"vindictive\" and said restoring those perks must be part of any deal to end the strike. \"The withdrawal of travel concessions from crew who have been on strike represents unacceptable anti-union bullying,\" Unite joint leaders Derek Simpson and Tony Woodley wrote in a letter to members. \"Any agreement to end this dispute must and will include a framework for the full restoration of those travel concessions.\" Other carriers are offering to accommodate BA passengers affected by the strike. British carrier BMI, which flies to Europe and the Middle East, said Friday it had added 4,500 seats to its normal Heathrow flight schedule and Ryanair offered special fares to BA passengers. British Airways and Unite have been at odds for more than a year over changes the airline wants to make to cabin crew pay and work practices. BA says the changes will save the company more than 60 million pounds ($90 million) a year. Unite has said the plans, which call for longer work hours and less staffing, will damage customer service and the BA brand. Stock analysts have said BA has made clear it sees the action not only as a matter of money but who will run the airline -- management or the union. Unite said Friday the two strikes will cost British Airways about Â£100 million ($149 million), double what BA estimated earlier in the week.",

    "input": "(EW.com) -- It has been over three years since we last saw Will Smith on the silver screen in 2008â²s \"Seven Pounds.\" Regardless of the profession, three years is a long break. But in the movie industry, it can be an eternity. So it was only natural for many to wonder whether Smith's previous box-office dominance would waver at all when \"Men in Black 3\" hit theaters last weekend. Could the movie star pick up where he left off in 2008 and continue selling a gazillion tickets as though his sabbatical simply never occurred? Well, sort of. \"Men in Black 3\" opened to $54.6 million last weekend (or $69.3 million if you include Memorial Day). While that's slightly better than the debuts of 1997â²s \"Men in Black\" ($51.1 million) and 2002â²s \"Men in Black II\" ($52.1 million), \"Men in Black 3\" actually sold far fewer tickets. If you adjust for ticket-price inflation, then \"Men in Black\" and \"Men in Black II\" opened to $88.2 million and $71.2 million, respectively. The legacy of 'men' in black . Furthermore, the first two \"MIB\" movies debuted on Wednesdays and would have scored even larger figures had they been held until Friday, like \"Men in Black 3\" was. And \"Men in Black 3\" was the series' only entry to benefit from 3-D surcharges. So \"Men in Black 3's\" performance was actually something of a disappointment, especially when considering its gargantuan $230 million budget. But to what extent, if any, is Will Smith to blame here? After all, we're talking about a threequel that was released a decade after the last installment -- and \"Men in Black II\" was a very poorly received installment to boot. Even if Smith had continued acting these past three years, it would probably be unreasonable to expect \"Men in Black 3\" to perform significantly better than it did. Also, according to the market-research firm CinemaScore, 50 percent of moviegoers listed Smith as their reason for buying a ticket to \"Men in Black 3.\" So the actor was still the main drawing factor for the film. Take a look at Smith's five last features: \"Seven Pounds,\" \"Hancock,\" \"I Am Legend,\" \"The Pursuit of Happyness,\" and \"Hitch.\" Yes, \"Men in Black 3\" failed to compete with the likes of \"Hancock\" ($62.6 million debut) and \"I Am Legend\" ($77.2 million). But if you averaged the openings of all five films, it'd come out to $45 million -- or $52 million when adjusted for ticket-price inflation. In that light, \"Men in Black 3's\" $54.6 million debut isn't so disheartening. Disappointing for such a pricey sci-fi action franchise? Sure. But a stain on Smith's box-office report card? Not really. The real test for Smith will be his next film, the M. Night Shyamalan sci-fi thriller \"After Earth,\" which will costar the actor's son, Jaden Smith. It's an original project, so franchise fatigue won't be a viable excuse this time. And it won't be released for another year (June 7, 2013). But while we wait, it's nice to see a movie star of Will Smith's caliber back on the big screen -- even if his star is shining a tiny bit less brightly than it used to. See the full story at EW.com .

    "input": "(CNN Student News) -- February 15, 2011 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . â¢ Iran â¢ Algeria â¢ Tokyo, Japan . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CENTENNIAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS: This is for you, Carl! CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: Gotta say thanks to the students at Centennial High School in Ellicott City, Maryland for that. As a former drummer, I can tell you were right on rhythm! I'm Carl Azuz. Today's commercial-free subjects include economics, social studies and health. Let's go ahead and get started. First Up: 2012 Budget . AZUZ: First up, economics, as President Obama presents his ideas for the federal government's 2012 budget. You or your family have to make budgets, looking at how much money you earn versus how much you spend. The government does the same thing, but with a lot more zeroes. In fact, this budget request from the president, which is just for 2012, is for $3.7 trillion; more money than most of us can even imagine. The goal of a budget is to make sure you don't spend more than you make. But that's exactly what the U.S. government is doing right now, which is why we have what's called a deficit. President Obama says his new budget will cut that deficit by $1 trillion over the next 10 years by making some pretty big cuts to a lot of government programs, and by making more money from increasing some taxes. But there are critics on both sides. Some Republicans argue that the president's proposed cuts won't do nearly enough, and some Democrats say that President Obama wants to cut too much. Another important thing to keep in mind. What the president released is a budget request. He doesn't actually decide on what the budget is. That's the job of Congress, and it can choose to accept, reject or modify the president's plan. Protests in Iran . AZUZ: Going global now, with headlines of political protests in two different countries. First, Iran, where tens of thousands of people marched through the capital yesterday. They were speaking out against the Iranian government. Security forces were out on the streets too. At times, they allowed the protesters to march, but there were also reports of fighting between police and protesters. This YouTube video shows tear gas being used to break up a protest. It's hard for CNN to verify some of the reports coming from Iran because the country makes it hard for journalists to cover these kinds of protests. And the Iranian government slowed down the internet in what seems like an attempt to limit how much information gets out. Algeria Unrest . AZUZ: The other country we're looking at where people are calling for change in their government is Algeria. This is a north African nation that's home to nearly 35 million people. As you can see from these pictures, protesters and security forces faced off against each other this past weekend. Yesterday, Algerian officials said they're going to lift a \"state of emergency\" that Algeria has been under since 1992. Some experts say that decision might be an attempt for Algeria to avoid uprisings like we've seen recently in Egypt and in Tunisia. I.D. Me . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: See if you can I.D. Me! I'm an organic compound that works as a stimulant. I affect the body's nervous system, as well as the heart and kidneys. I have a bitter taste, but no odor. I'm caffeine, and having too much of me can make you anxious or irritable. Energy Drink Warning . AZUZ: It's the caffeine, plus the other stimulants in energy drinks, that can give young people health problems. This is according to new medical research on the risks of energy drinks. Caffeine, as you know, is a legal stimulant. It's just that large amounts of it can be dangerous. One study found that almost half of all caffeine overdoses back in 2007 happened in people younger than 19. So what are the risks? Well, caffeine -- too much of it -- can mess up your sleep patterns. It can increase your blood pressure, which can put a strain on your heart. And if you're on any medications, caffeine can interfere with them and cause additional problems. Symptoms of too much caffeine: nausea, dizziness, rapid heart rate and seizure. I wanna be clear we're not talking about sports drinks, like Gatorade or Powerade. Those can actually be good for you, helping hydrate you after a big game. You can distinguish energy drinks by their ingredients. Energy drinks might include caffeine, taurine and guarana, additional stimulants that can hit different people in different ways. Responding to this report, the American Beverage Association says a lot of drinks you can get have caffeine in them, and that \"young adults getting coffee from popular coffeehouses are getting twice as much caffeine as they would from a similar size energy drink.\" Giffords' Recovery . AZUZ: U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords is talking to her brother-in-law. Might not sound like a major news story, but it is a huge step for Rep. Giffords, whom you see here. She was shot in the head last month during an attack in Arizona. Family members and officials say she is making incredible progress in her recovery. Part of that is her conversations with her brother-in-law Scott Kelly, an astronaut currently on board the international space station. Giffords' husband, Mark Kelly, is also an astronaut. He's scheduled to go into space in April. Shoutout . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mr. Giorno's humanities class at Girard College Lower School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania! What country has the world's fastest growing economy? You know what to do! Is it: A) China, B) Japan, C) the United States or D) Russia? You've got three seconds -- GO! China has the world's fastest growing economy. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! The New #2 Economy . AZUZ: It's because of that growth that China has made a move in terms of the world's largest economies. China is now the second largest, behind only the U.S. What does that mean for the former number two, Japan? We're checking in with Kyung Lah, who explains how a move in the economic rankings means a change in power. (BEGIN VIDEO) KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT, TOKYO: Step into Laox electronics store and you can hear the shift of economic might in Asia. Chinese greets shoppers. Sales signs are in Chinese. Workers assist shoppers in Mandarin. What's odd: we're in downtown Tokyo. But the people with the purchasing power here are not the Japanese. You don't have to tell this electronics store about the economic power shift in Asia. It's something they've seen for quite some time. When it comes to the number of paying customers, they see about 200 Japanese a day. Compare that with the number of Chinese: 1,000 customers every single day. LIN DONG DONG, LAOX TRANSLATOR: I'm proud of China! LAH: ...says Lin Dong Dong, a Chinese immigrant who's risen with the fortunes of his home country. He works for Laox as a translator but plans to become a doctor. Today, he's helping out this Chinese tour group here in Tokyo to spend money. NOBUKAZU IINO, LAOX STORE MANAGER [TRANSLATED]: \"Japan was once like China,\" says Laox's store manager, referring to Japan's economic surge in the 1980s. \"It's China's turn now.\" LAH: China has blazed ahead, expanding its manufacturing sector and domestic infrastructure. At this pace, Japan's government estimates China will overtake the U.S. economy in just 15 years. Japan, meanwhile, has been stuck in two decades of stagnation and deflation amid indecisive economic policymaking. It now faces a demographic tsunami: the world's fastest aging population, one of the lowest birthrates, and a debt-to-GDP ratio that's highest among developed nations. That may be a snapshot of economic might, but economists warn it's not so black and white. KIRBY DALEY, SR. STRATEGIST, NEWEDGE: Japan's demographic tsunami, as it was termed, is very real and is going to stunt growth in that country for years to come. They need to get that situation under control. But China also has a demographic tsunami of its own, to re-use that term, coming as well. UNIDENTIFIED CHINESE MALE [TRANSLATED]: \"I know we became the world's number two economy,\" says this Chinese shopper. \"But we still have very poor people and there's a gap between rich and poor. I hope China as a whole becomes a wealthy country like Japan.\" KEIICHI YAMAMOTO, TOKYO RESIDENT [TRANSLATED]: \"I envy China's hungry spirit,\" says Keiichi Yamamoto, who says what's missing most in Japan is passion and drive. \"But I believe Japan still has potential. It'll come back again.\" LAH: Two Asian powers adjusting to a new economic world order. Kyung Lah, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEO) Free Downloadable Maps . AZUZ: Japan, Algeria, Iran.

The terrier and her 86-year-old workout partner hit the gym twice a day. It's nice that they exercise together. But if this gym rat wants to put on some serious muscle and all she does is walk on the treadmill... Goodbye . AZUZ: ...I don't think she's going to get anywhere.

    "input": "San Diego, California (CNN) -- And then they came for the children. Just when you thought Arizona lawmakers couldn't stoop any lower, these cowardly and shameful politicians grab a shovel and put in a basement. This fall, the Arizona legislature is expected to debate a bill that would deny birth certificates to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants -- the \"anchor babies\" that some Republicans have been trying to marginalize for years. The lawmakers are cowards because, first, they go after illegal immigrants who don't vote, lobby or contribute to political campaigns. And now they're going after children who don't vote, lobby or contribute to political campaigns. Whom are they not going after? Employers of illegal immigrants. You know why? Because they vote, lobby and contribute to political campaigns. By the way, the term \"anchor babies,\" which refers to the tots that supposedly increase the chances that mommy and daddy can stay in the United States even if mommy and daddy are in the country illegally, isn't just offensive and crude. It's also misleading. The fact that Elvira Arellano, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who was famously holed up in a Chicago, Illinois, church, had a U.S.-born son didn't stop federal officials from deporting her in 2007. Some anchor. The real anchor is a job, the kind eagerly provided by U.S. employers who thumb their noses at federal law prohibiting the hiring of illegal immigrants. In fact, right-wingers acknowledge as much when they argue that if we dry up the jobs, illegal immigrants will self-deport. What about their kids, some of which were born in the United States? Why not stay for them? Simple: Employment takes precedence. Thus, according to conservatives' own arguments, there aren't anchor babies -- only anchor jobs. Also, you can bet that some of the same people who oppose citizenship for the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants also oppose the idea of granting a pathway to earned legalization -- what they call \"amnesty\" -- to illegal immigrants. Why? Because, they say, you can't willy-nilly convert those who are illegal to legal. Then how can those folks be so cavalier about making that conversion in the opposite direction by changing legal to illegal? Lastly, one of the things you hear from amnesty opponents is that illegal immigrants should certainly not be given U.S. citizenship. It's just too valuable, they say. Agreed. But if it's so valuable, then why are some on the right so quick to strip it away from the children of illegal immigrants? Don't U.S. citizens deserve more respect than that? Apparently not. In the late 1990s, the member of Congress leading the crusade against \"birthright citizenship\" was Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-California. The San Diego-area congressman proposed a bill to limit the privilege to the children of U.S. citizens. The legislation didn't go anywhere. It couldn't even get a hearing from some of Bilbray's fellow Republicans, who cringed at the idea of visiting the sins of the parents onto the children. The same was true for another failed attempt by Rep. Nathan Deal, R-Georgia, who, in 2005, proposed a bill that explicitly denied citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. The bill didn't go anywhere either, in part because not enough Republicans would even agree to give it a hearing. That same year, I discussed the idea with Rep. James Sensenbrenner, who was then chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and the author of a sweeping piece of legislation called \"The Border Protection, Anti-Terrorism, and Immigration Control Act of 2005.\" Among other things, the bill would have made unauthorized presence in the United States a felony. Yet even Sensenbrenner, not exactly a softhearted liberal, wouldn't touch the idea of denying citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants. When fellow Republicans tried to insert such language into his bill, he was careful to keep it out. There was a time when Republicans knew better than to handle radioactive material. My, how times have changed. And now all the opponents of birthright citizenship have to do is change the Constitution. The 14th Amendment makes clear that anyone born in the United States, with the possible exception of the children of foreign diplomats, is a U.S. citizen. \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\" Grasping at straws, restrictionists and nativists claim that illegal immigrants aren't \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of the United States. So what? My concern isn't that critics don't know how to read the law. It's that they don't know how to read -- period. Jurisdiction applies not to the parents, but to the children. As U.S. citizens, they're subject to U.S. laws, but they also enjoy the protection of the U.S. Constitution. The closed border / closed mind crowd may not like it, but that's the way it is. I'm not surprised that this escapes the state of Arizona. iReporter supports the bill . Given all that's happened in recent weeks in its jihad against not illegal immigrants but Hispanics in general, the Grand Canyon State seems to have more than its share of people who slept through high school civics, and they're being advised by lawyers who were obviously absent the day they taught \"law\" in law school. That's not a good look. The U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants are legally entitled to U.S. citizenship. What part of \"legal\" don't the critics understand? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette Jr.",

    "input": "Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The deadly protests in northern Afghanistan over a Quran burning spread to the country's war-torn southern region on Saturday, with provincial government officials reporting at least nine civilians dead and dozens injured. The violence struck the city of Kandahar when demonstrators took to the streets to protest the torching of Islam's most sacred book by a U.S. church. The unrest followed a demonstration on Friday in the northern town of Mazar-e Sharif, in which five demonstrators and seven U.N. employees were killed when an angry throng stormed the U.N. compound there. U.S. President Barack Obama on Saturday extended condolences to the families and loved ones of those killed in Mazar-e Sharif, but also decried the burning of the Quran. \"The desecration of any holy text ... is an act of extreme intolerance and bigotry,\" he said in a statement released by the White House. \"However, to attack and kill innocent people in response is outrageous, and an affront to human decency and dignity.\" Besmellah Afghanmal, a Kandahar provincial council member, said hundreds gathered in Kandahar city to protest the Quran burning. \"Today the enemies of peace in Afghanistan killed and injured our people in Kandahar,\" said a statement from the office of the Kandahar governor. The demonstration started peacefully, but protesters turned violent, setting fire to a school and vehicles in Kandahar city, said Zalmai Ayoubi, spokesman for the governor of Kandahar province. Along with the nine deaths, 73 others were injured, the provincial government said. Ayoubi said Afghan security forces arrested 17 people, including seven who were armed and are suspected of shooting at protesters. Pastor Terry Jones sparked international controversy last year when his Gainesville, Florida, church planned \"International Burn a Quran Day\" on the ninth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Jones' church did not host a Quran burning on that day, but the Dove World Outreach Center's website announced an \"International Judge the Koran Day\" set for last month. Another post on the site's blog showed an image of a burning book and read, \"The event is over, the Koran was found guilty and a copy was burned inside the building.\" Some witnesses in Kandahar said protesters were shot by police. \"I saw personally three people who (were) shot to death, and one of them was shot just next to me,\" protester Shah Meer said. But police said they neither shot at nor killed anyone. \"There (was) gunfire into the air in order to bring the people under control, and luckily not one has been killed as a result of the gunfire,\" said Zemarai Bashari, spokesman for the interior ministry. Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Taliban said the group was not behind any deaths during the event. \"What happened in Kandahar today was the feeling of the nation, and the Islamic movement of the Taliban was not involved in any (violence),\" Zabiullah Mojahed said. \"It was the Afghan police that killed the innocent people of Kandahar while they were expressing their feeling against the burning of holy Quran in Florida.\" The Mazar-e Sharif killings generated worldwide condemnation, from the U.N. Security Council to the Organization of the Islamic Conference, a 57-state group that calls itself the \"collective voice of the Muslim world.\" Jones in a statement Friday called the assault \"a very tragic and criminal action.\" Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai, a spokesman for the police in Mazar-e Sharif, told reporters that a number of suspects \"who might be the main organizers\" had been arrested from the Friday attack . The United Nations says the seven U.N. staffers killed were four Nepalese security guards and three civilians. A U.N. source said the three civilians were from Norway, Sweden and Romania. U.N. Peacekeeping Director Alain Le Roy said five demonstrators also were killed. He said no Afghan U.N. staff members were among the dead, he said. \"I understand there were hundreds, if not thousands, of demonstrators. Some of them were clearly armed and they stormed into the building,\" Le Roy said. He said the security guards tried their best to halt the demonstrators' advance, but were overwhelmed. Le Roy said it was not clear that the United Nations was the target. \"It happened to be the U.N. because the U.N. is on the ground.\" Another 24 people were wounded, said Abdul Rauof Taj, security director of Balkh province. The U.N. Security Council met Friday and issued a statement condemning the attack, which occurred at the operations center of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA. Haji Sakhi Mohammad, a businessman in Mazar-e Sharif, said the incident began after Friday prayers, when many people joined a protest against the burning of the Quran. People calling \"Death to America\" marched to the U.N. compound and broke in, he said. Gunfire broke out, and \"I saw protesters shot to death,\" he said . A student in Mazar-e-Sharif said he and his friends joined the protesters, who numbered in the hundreds. \"When we reached the UNAMA office, we came under gunfire by Afghan security guards. Protesters became angry and stormed the building.\" Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the Quran burning during a speech before Pakistan's legislature on March 22. \"May I, at the outset, strongly condemn on behalf of the people of Pakistan and on my own behalf the deliberate desecration of the holy Quran by a fanatic in Florida,\" he said, according to a transcript of speech. \"We condemn this act in the strongest possible words. ... It is a serious setback to the efforts at promoting harmony among civilized communities throughout the world.\" CNN's Matiullah Mati and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report .",

    "input": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- Is it possible to have a building that can make you happy, sad, or even angry? The Experience Music Project in Seattle has appeared in the Forbes list of ugly buildings. Does it affect your mood? Alain de Botton thinks it is. The Swiss-born British writer, modern-day philosopher, and author of international bestseller \"The Architecture of Happiness\", believes there is more to buildings and architecture than we may think. Taking on 19th Century French writer Stendhal's motto that \"beauty is the promise of happiness,\" de Botton analyzes human surroundings and considers how our needs and desires are transferred into architecture. He also discusses the amount to which architecture can affect our personal happiness. De Botton told CNN he felt that a beautiful building, or likewise, an ugly structure, could affect how we feel. \"Beauty has a huge role to play in altering our mood. When we call a chair or a house beautiful, really what we're saying is that we like the way of life it's suggesting to us. It has an attitude we're attracted to: if it was magically turned into a person, we'd like who it was. \"It would be convenient if we could remain in much the same mood wherever we happened to be ...but unfortunately we're highly vulnerable to the coded messages that emanate from our surroundings,\" he said. But, how do buildings manage to cast their bricks and mortar over our emotions? \"One might say that architecture suggests a mood to us, which we may be too internally troubled to be able to take up. Its effectiveness could be compared to the weather: a fine day can substantially change our state of mind -- and people may be willing to make great sacrifices to be nearer a sunny climate,\" de Botton said. De Botton believed that structures communicate with us in various ways. \"This book focuses our minds on the idea that buildings speak -- and on topics which can readily be discerned. They speak of democracy or aristocracy, openness or arrogance, welcome or threat, a sympathy for the future or a hankering for the past.\" So, indeed your own house could be making you happy or sad, de Botton suggests. \"They (houses) tell us of certain moods that they seek to encourage and sustain in their inhabitants. While keeping us warm and helping us in mechanical ways, they simultaneously hold out an invitation for us to be specific sorts of people. They speak of particular visions of happiness,\" he said. De Botton said there are \"thousands\" of public buildings which are ugly and could possibly force a negative, saddening, or even potential anger-producing mood upon us. What are some examples? De Botton is quick to mention the new Westfield mall opening in Shepherd's Bush, London, which he describes as a \"monument to human idiocy\" which represents a \"large, confused shed, which offers the wider community nothing but a windowless faÃ§ade clad in nauseating green paneling, with an utter indifference to symmetry, proportion or beauty\". And what other buildings could be considered a structure of sadness? Certainly, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen's Experience Music Project building in Seattle has to be a nominee -- featuring in the Forbes list of the top ten ugliest buildings in the world. Elsewhere, London's Millennium Dome (or 02 Arena) and Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, are other well-known candidates for buildings that could destroy one's day, after featuring in various \"ugly\" lists. At the other end of the scale, de Botton has some ideas about structures we should cast our eyes upon to make us happy. While all of this is rather subjective, de Botton said there were some aesthetic values that were universally appreciated. He was particularly fond of the highly-detailed yet serene Senate House in Bloomsbury, London, and also the Georgian-style architecture of Bedford Square, also in London. It's fair to say though, that not everyone in the architectural world is as optimistic about the power of architecture over people. In a debate with architect Robert Adam organized by building.co.uk, Adam attacked de Botton's ideas. After questioning de Botton's use of the word \"us\" when presenting some opinions, Adam said he did not believe that people were culturally aware enough to take notice of such details. \"I wouldn't call myself a pessimist because it would mean I feel bad about popular culture, which I don't. What I think we have at the moment is people who are unprepared to take on the language of the greater part of the population,\" he said. We want to know what you think. Do you believe buildings can influence the way we feel? Give us your examples of buildings that make you happy or sad in the Sound Off box below and we'll publish the best.",

    "input": "(CareerBuilder.com) -- The importance of references seems to be a hot topic these days. Employers want to make sure they are hiring the right person for the job; but some thwart the process because checking references can be labor-intensive. On the other hand, job seekers provide references they know will give a glowing report, but employers are getting smarter and finding references you didn't provide. So, what's the deal? Do references matter? Do employers even check them anymore? What's the protocol for providing them to a potential employer? Who are the best people to include as references? And, if an employer doesn't call any of your references, is it a bad sign? While the definitive answer to any of these questions depends on the employer, overall, yes, references do still matter. The process has just changed. \"References play a huge role in the hiring process, perhaps now more than ever,\" said Heather R. Huhman, founder and president of Come Recommended, an online community that connects internship and entry-level job candidates with employers.\" Oftentimes, hiring managers fall in love with a candidate on paper and then again in an interview, only to find out through a reference check that none of their previous employers would ever hire them again. By checking a candidate's references, hiring managers save themselves the frustration of hiring a person who is not a good fit for a company. In this economy, where hiring budgets are slim, every hire must be a great fit.\" Provided references are no guarantee . Though the majority of employers do check references, others skip this step. Not only is it labor-intensive to check references for people who might not be poised for a job offer, but Jack Harsh, adjunct professor at the University of Richmond Robins School of Business, said that many employers worry about the risk of liability in rejecting a candidate based on poor references. \"[Hiring] decisions cannot be based on information that is discriminatory in nature, so to avoid any liability, the checks are forgone,\" Harsh said. \"Sadly, the first reference the employer gets in such cases is from colleagues after employment has begun.\" Steve Langerud, director of career development at Depauw University, adds that sometimes, the quality of references is benign. \"Everyone wants to be helpful and supportive to former employees, but in the end, they offer little substance to a new employer,\" he says. \"Legally, they are limited by what they can or want to say about former employees. I think the old formal system of references is dead in most professional fields.\" Langerud warns that just because an employer isn't checking personal references the traditional way doesn't mean he isn't checking references at all. \"Employers are more likely to check the informal, but tangible, behavioral reference sources like LinkedIn, Facebook, credit history [or] criminal history than the more subjective references provided by candidates,\" he said. \"Candidates should be much more intentional about crafting a professional identity that serves the role of a 'reference' but within the context of the work, profession and colleagues you seek to engage. It eliminates the weaknesses inherent in the old style of references that become so watered down they are useless.\" Making the right choices . The last thing you want to do is give an employer useless references, but many job seekers make the mistake of not taking the time to thoughtfully choose the right people to speak on their behalf, said Elaine Varelas, managing partner for Keystone Partners, an outplacement and talent management consulting firm. \"You want people who can speak to your role as a professional, not as a nice neighbor,\" Varelas said. \"Candidates can make their references count by prepping them to discuss their specific skills as they relate to the job and the impact they brought to the job, which can be just the differentiation needed in this highly competitive market.\" Harsh agrees that when he receives a rÃ©sumÃ© with references attached, he gives them virtually no weight. \"They seldom are specific to the role my company seeks and are not meaningful in considering qualifications or traits of successful candidate,\" he said. Finally, when it comes to protocol for submitting references, the process has changed as well. It used to be that applicants sent them in with their other application materials, but now, Varelas says, you should wait to provide references until you are asked. \"Most companies do not want your references until the end of the process and they will let you know when to provide a list of names and contact information. Do not send written references,\" she said. \"These do not offer the highest impact as they are not specific on how you will fit into the job you are pursuing. It is better to spend your time preparing your references for the kinds of questions they will be asked, and what they can do to help you close an offer.\" Helpful hints . Harsh, Varelas and Langerud offer these 10 tips to ensure you do everything right when it comes to providing references: . 1. Include references only when requested by an employer. 2. Carefully consider whom to provide after discussion with the prospective employer. The time to check references is before an offer is made, but after the candidate is either the final candidate or among the final few for the job. 3. Seek references from people who actually know you and your work. Ask for permission to list them as a reference. 4. Ask directly if they can provide you with a positive reference for the position(s) you are seeking. If they hesitate, move on! 5. Prepare your references about who will be calling them and what to focus on when talking about you. Always ask them to call you after they have been called. 6. Prepare your references to speak consistently about your skills, but not identically. Suggest a different highlight for each person. Have 100 percent confidence in what they will say and how they speak about you, or cross them off the list. 7. Provide accurate contact information about your references, and ask your references how they prefer to be contacted (e-mail, phone, etc.). 8. Let your references know what happens to you and the position(s) you applied for. Thank your references. 9. Prepare a LinkedIn site to demonstrate your skills and interests. 10. Participate in professional blogs to create a history of professional involvement in your field that is independent of your work history.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- For two weeks in 1976, Nadia Comaneci was probably the most recognizable person on the planet. Comaneci scored seven perfect 10s in Montreal in 1976. Just 14-years-old and standing less than five feet tall, the elfin Romanian was the undisputed star of that year's Games in Montreal after becoming the first gymnast in history to score a perfect 10. Comaneci finished up with three gold medals and -- just to prove that her initial effort had been no fluke -- seven perfect scores. Her initial performance on the uneven parallel bars was greeted with uproar as the three-digit scoreboard, struggling to cope with what had been considered an unachievable feat, flashed up 1.00. Comaneci finished with four perfect 10s and the gold medal on the bars, but it was on the balance beam, one of gymnastics' most dangerous disciplines, that Comaneci truly dazzled. Seemingly fearless, Comaneci pirouetted and back-flipped her way to two more perfect 10s and her second gold. Her final perfect score came in the floor routine as she also collected first place in the overall competition. Comaneci's transformation into an international celebrity -- she appeared on the front covers of Time, Newsweek and Sports Illustrated in the same week -- had been as unexpected as it was sudden. Yet Comaneci had been working towards the Olympics ever since she had been picked out as a gymnast of rare talents as a six-year-old growing up in the industrial town of Onesti. The reality of life as an Olympic champion at home in Nicolae Ceausescu's Romania however, was not easy. Constant surveillance Comaneci was honored as a Hero of Socialist Labor on her return home, yet the regime -- terrified that Comaneci would defect after enjoying her taste of western celebrity -- kept its greatest star under constant surveillance. Four years later, a very different Comaneci returned to Olympic competition in Moscow. As an 18-year-old, she was four inches taller, 20 pounds heavier and suffering from sciatica -- a teenage starlet already starting to fade. Still, Comaneci was able to retain her gold medal on the balance beam, and collected another one in the floor exercises. But she was also involved in one of the bitterest incidents of the Games when she was controversially beaten in the all-round competition by the Soviet gymnast Yelena Davydova. It took the judges 28 minutes to decide the result and, ultimately, it was a lower score from the Soviet judge -- perhaps reflecting the worsening relations between the Soviet Union and its formerly loyal satellite -- that denied Comaneci her second straight gold in the event. Comaneci retired in 1984, traveling to Los Angeles that year as a team coach, yet she found it difficult to adjust to a life out of the spotlight. In 1989, a few weeks before the collapse of the Ceausescu regime, she defected to the United States, finally settling in Norman, Oklahoma to run a gymnastics school after marrying U.S. gymnastics star Bart Conner in 1996. In 2000 Comaneci was named as one of the athletes of the century by the Laureus World Sports Academy. E-mail to a friend .",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama gave the go-ahead for U.S. forces to raid a northern Pakistan housing compound based on \"what was probably a 50-50 chance that Osama bin Laden was there,\" his national security adviser said. \"It was a circumstantial case ... But what he had 100 percent confidence in was the ability of our special forces to execute the mission,\" Tom Donilon told CNN's Candy Crowley on Saturday, part of an interview that aired Sunday on \"State of the Union.\" On April 28, Obama attended the last of several National Security Council meetings focused on finding and going after the al Qaeda leader. During that meeting, some advocated for the commando raid while others advised against it, Donilon said, given there had been no clear-cut sightings of bin Laden by that point. \"He had gotten divided counsel, and that happens a lot in these things, as you would imagine,\" Donilon said. After a night's sleep, Obama told Donilon at 8:20 a.m. the next day to draft the order for the raid. By Sunday evening -- which was early Monday morning in Pakistan -- the 38-minute mission was over, the 25-strong U.S. team having flown out of the country along with bin Laden's dead body. Like other Obama administration officials, Donilon applauded the decision and its end result of knocking out the No. 1 man on the FBI's \"Most Wanted Terrorist\" list. He called it \"the single biggest achievement we've ever had\" in the fight against al Qaeda. Especially as they continue poring through voluminous material taken from the complex, U.S. authorities are more convinced than ever that bin Laden had a significant operational and strategic role, not to mention a key symbolic one, in the terrorist network. His death, said Donilon, is a major blow to al Qaeda. \"At the end of last year, we assessed that al Qaeda had been diminished ... to its weakest since 2001,\" said the security adviser, who previously served in the administrations of presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. \"And they took a very big step back Sunday.\" One reason for that assessment is what Donilon called the \"extraordinary\" amount of intelligence that U.S. special forces were able to take from the Abbottabad compound. A multi-agency task force is currently poring through those documents, computer hard drives and other materials -- intermittently releasing information including five videotapes featuring bin Laden that came out Saturday. \"This is the largest cache of information gotten from a senior terrorist -- gotten from any terrorist in one operation,\" Donilon said, calling the amount of seized material about equal to \"the size of a small college library.\" Despite doubts from some conspiracy theorists, al Qaeda itself has admitted that bin Laden was killed. That means that his deputy, Egyptian doctor and radical Ayman al-Zawahiri, will rise to the top of the FBI list, according to Donilon, even as U.S. and allied forces continue their efforts to find him and other al Qaeda leaders. Last week, CIA Director Leon Panetta (who Obama has nominated to succeed Robert Gates as defense secretary) told House members during a closed-door briefing that Pakistan was \"either involved or incompetent,\" according to two sources in attendance. There have been no indications Pakistani authorities knew about or acted upon knowledge that bin Laden was living in the same town as one of its top military academies. Donilon did not suggest Pakistani authorities knew the al Qaeda leader lived in the city, about 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of the capital Islamabad, or that they somehow harbored him. He said, \"I have not seen any evidence, at least to date, that the political, military or intelligence apparatus knew about the presence of Osama bin Laden.\" Yet U.S. authorities are troubled by the fact that the al Qaeda leader could stay there \"for six years or so\" undetected, said Donilon. \"We'll clearly be working with (Pakistani authorities) to understand how we got to this point,\" he said. Donilon noted Pakistan's active role in tracking down terrorists, calling them a \"very important partner\" despite the existence of some \"differences\" with U.S. authorities. He said, \"If we find things ... that are highly disturbing, we'll certainly press that\" -- though he expected that Islamabad and Washington would continue to work together. \"We need to look at this in a calm and cool way,\" Donilon said, adding, \"a relationship with Pakistan, given everything we have at stake in that region, is an important relationship.\"",

    "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Sometimes, a T-shirt just doesn't cut it. Allie Tompkins, 19, gets her first tattoo at Fatty's Tattooz on Monday. For those who want a more permanent way to showcase their support for Barack Obama, Washington's tattoo parlors are ready to help. \"There's nothing more memorable than a tattoo,\" said Matt Jessup, better known as \"Fatty,\" the owner of Fatty's Custom Tattooz and Body Piercing. His shop is celebrating what it has dubbed the \"Obamathan,\" where customers can get a free \"Obama '08\" logo tattoo if they buy another tattoo worth $200. The Obama tattoo, Fatty says, is worth $70. \"A lot of people are feeling very inspired and taken by this moment in our nation's history. And for many people, they are in town for this historic event, they want something to remember it by,\" he said. At Fatty's and other tattoo shops in the area, there have been multiple inquiries about getting inked with an Obama image, they say, but only a few people have actually gone through with. The most popular choices so far have been the Obama logo, the word \"hope,\" and the now iconic red-and-blue Obama hope poster by Shepard Fairey. T.J. Mohler, who works at Jinx Proof Tattoos, said business has been up as people flood the city, but only \"about two or three\" customers have gotten an Obama tattoo. One of those people is Mohler himself, who opted for a 5 x 7-inch Obama image on his leg. \"When I look back in 50 years, it will remind me of the time and how excited everyone is,\" Mohler said. None of the shop owners reported any history of George W. Bush tattoos. \"No such thing,\" said Jason Anthony, owner of Midtown Tattoo. Fatty says he's hoping the number of people getting Obama art will grow as more visitors arrive and word about the Obamathon gets out. \"We're still rolling with it through the week, so I'm hoping that we'll get more interest,\" he said. On Wednesday, Fatty has plans to tattoo a portrait of Obama's face on one customer. That piece of art is worth $600, but the customer is getting it for free because she was the winner of one of the shop's promotions. But for those wary of permanent ink, there are some alternatives available. Glam Rock Art is a Washington business specializing in airbrush tattoos and body art. Owner and artist Nicole Graves has ordered custom Obama stencils in response to requests from customers. Fatty's also offers a removable option -- the Obama piercing. It's an orbital ring with a blue bead that costs $44, in honor of the 44th president. And if a customer has a change of heart post-tattoo, Fatty says all is not lost. \"Come on back and I'll cover it up with something else,\" he said.",

    "input": "LAKE VIEW TERRACE, California (CNN)  -- A massive fire that has charred more than 147,000 acres in Southern California and destroyed dozens of homes north of Los Angeles was caused by arson, a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman said Thursday. A wildfire burns close to blackened hills in the Angeles National Forest outside Los Angeles on Wednesday. A homicide investigation has been initiated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department into the deaths of two firefighters as a result of the Station fire, said spokeswoman Rita Wears. The firefighters died Sunday in a vehicle crash while trying to escape fast-moving flames. The fire was at 38 percent containment Thursday. It has been burning for more than a week. Fire officials said progress has been made, particularly on the west side of the fire, but the blaze was still producing hot spots, including one that forced the evacuation of 25 residents early Thursday. Families in 11 homes were awakened at about 4 a.m. and given three hours to leave their homes near the Dillon Divide community. The fire had scorched 147,418 acres as of Thursday. Residents have fled from 10,000 homes along the edge of the Angeles Forest since the fire began on August 26. However, the majority of evacuees were allowed back into their homes by Wednesday.  Watch as firefighters struggle to keep the blaze at bay Â» . \"We're fighting for every foot of containment we can get on this fire,\" said U.S. Forest Service Fire Chief Mike Dietrich. He said firefighters have made progress controlling the northern and western parameters of the fire, but the priority is to keep the southeastern corner of the fire away from areas along Interstate 210, including Pasadena, Arcadia and Sierra Madre. The blaze is headed toward the San Gabriel Wilderness Area of the Angeles forest. The San Gabriel represents the eastern edge of the fire, he said. Nearly all the fire was in forest land and the nearby foothill communities, including La Canada Flintridge, La Crescenta and Acton. \"This is a very complicated situation, and it continues to be complicated as it moves east,\" Dietrich said. The fire has destroyed 64 homes, three commercial properties and 49 outdoor structures since it began last week, authorities said. The state has spent about $27 million so far fighting the fire in the Angeles National Forest, Dietrich said. Firefighters expect to have the blaze fully contained by September 15. Earlier, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger was asked about the cost of the firefighting, given the state's precarious financial position. \"I've made it clear that even though we have a budget crunch and we have an economic crisis and we just solved a $23 billion deficit, we will always have the money available to fight the fires because public safety is our No. 1 priority,\" Schwarzenegger responded. That budget gap covers two years. The governor said he insisted that the state budget he signed in July have a $500 million reserve for emergencies such as fires. California has had 5,000 blazes so far this year, he said. He said 21 firefighters have been injured battling the Station fire, in addition to the two killed Sunday. While temperatures remain high, the humidity level increased on Wednesday and Thursday -- a boon to the firefighting efforts. Firefighters could get another break if temperatures cool off on Friday, as expected. CNN's Barbara Starr in Lake View Terrace, California, contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- In recent days, Michoacan, the home state of President Felipe Calderon, has become a flashpoint of violence in Mexico's deadly war against drug cartels. Since Calderon went after the drug cartels shortly after coming into office in 2006, more than 10,000 people have died across Mexico, about 1,000 of them police. In the latest incident, 12 bodies of federal police officers were found on the side of a remote highway, said Monte Alejandro Rubido Garcia, technical secretary for Mexico's national security council, at a news conference Tuesday. The bodies showed evidence of torture. The officers were \"ambushed while they were off duty by an armed group,\" Rubido said. One of the 12 officers was a woman. The bodies were found in a pile near the town of La Huacana, he added. Rubido said the slain officers had been doing \"investigative work\" in the city of Arteaga in Michoacan, one of the states most affected by the government's offensive against drug cartels. Rubido announced the arrest of Francisco Javier Frias Lara, known as \"El Chivo,\" in connection with the killings of the officers. Frias is a member of La Familia Michoacana, one of the region's most powerful drug cartels, Rubido said. Federal police around the country will redouble security measures for its agents, Rubido said. The sudden spike in violence followed the arrest Saturday of Arnoldo Rueda Medina, who authorities described as a high-ranking member of La Familia Michoacana. Cartel members first attacked the federal police station in Morelia to try to gain freedom for Rueda, authorities said. When that failed, the drug gangs attacked police installations in at least a half-dozen Michoacan cities. Coordinated attacks in eight cities over the weekend left three federal police officers and two soldiers dead. It was the federal police who arrested Rueda, and the current spate of attacks appear aimed at them in revenge. On Tuesday, two federal police officers were killed and four wounded in an ambush in Michoacan, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. Also Tuesday, a federal police station in the Michoacan city of Maravatio was attacked, news reports said. There were no immediate reports of casualties. A local Michoacan newspaper put the body count in recent days at 32. La Familia Michoacana emerged in the 1990s as a conservative paramilitary group designed to insulate the state from the large drug cartels, said Bruce Bagley, a professor at the University of Miami and expert on drug trafficking. But over the years, the group evolved into a drug trafficking operation itself, forging strategic alliances with warring cartels to raise its own profile. This week's violence solidifies the cartel as a major and violent player in Mexico's drug wars, Bagley said. \"This represents the third evolution of the Familia Michoacana,\" he said. Reprisals from drug cartels following major arrests have been reported before, but the intensity of these attacks in Michoacan are unprecedented. La Familia Michoacana wants \"to demonstrate that they have power and will not go away quietly into the night,\" Bagley said. Video from the scene of the slain officers showed three signs, known as narcomensajes, left by the killers that stated the same thing: \"So that you come for another. We will be waiting for you here.\" But the state of Michoacan, on Mexico's southwest Pacific coast, is not alone in the wave of violence sweeping the country. The border city of Ciudad Juarez set a record this weekend when its toll of drug-related deaths for the year topped 1,000, a distinction the Mexican city did not reach last year until September. At this point last year, the violence-plagued city across the border from El Paso, Texas, had tallied 596 killings, El Universal newspaper said Tuesday, citing figures from the Chihuahua state attorney general's office. Also in Chihuahua state, a mayor was shot and killed Tuesday morning while on his way to work. Ariel Meixequeiro had twice before temporarily left his post because he had been threatened by crime gangs, El Universal said. CNN's Mariano Castillo contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Emergency crews in the Philippines were on standby Monday morning as the island nation braced for a \"super typhoon\" that could trigger flooding and landslides. Super Typhoon Megi, also known as Juan, is expected to make landfall midday Monday at or near super-typhoon strength, with winds possibly in excess of 200 kph (124 mph), according to Mario Montejo, secretary of the Philippines' science and technology. On Monday morning, Megi carried sustained winds of 287 kph (178 mph) with gusts up to 350 kph (217 mph) as it headed toward the Philippines, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center said. \"Tropical storm force winds and heavy rain squalls are already affecting areas along the coast,\" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. \"From this point forward the weather conditions are expected to rapidly deteriorate.\" CNN meteorologist Ivan Cabrera called Megi a \"monster storm.\" Beyond high winds, large swaths of the northern island of Luzon will see 300 mm (12 inches) of rain, while more isolated pockets may see up to 500 mm (20 inches), Ward said. A typhoon of this intensity could cause storm surge as high as 6 to 8 meters, threatening population centers along the coast. As of 5 p.m. (5 a.m. ET) Sunday, the typhoon was about 390 kilometers east of Aparri, Cagayan, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. It was moving west at about 22 kph. Montejo said the government is alarmed by the speed and strength of the typhoon. He warned of potentially devastating effects the storm may wreak on Luzon. \"The winds have been steadily increasing,\" James Reynolds, a storm chaser who is on Luzon, told CNN Monday morning. \"Unfortunately, this is a part of the world where the infrastructure is quite fragile, the power grid is quite fragile and a lot of people live in quite basic houses,\" he said. Residents in low-lying and coastal areas are advised to head for safer locations, and authorities are discussing the possibility of forced evacuations. As the storm moves across the rugged terrain of Luzon, it is expected to decrease in intensity before moving out over the South China Sea. Megi is expected to dump large amounts of rainfall over the mountains, which could potentially trigger mudslides and localized flooding. The typhoon could also damage large amounts of agricultural land along its path. \"Thousands of hectares are in danger of being ruined,\" Cabrera said. On Sunday, Philippine navy spokesman Lt. Col. Edgard Arevalo said in a statement that disaster response personnel equipped with rubber boats and other life-saving equipment are on standby in several areas.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- Fresh off an electoral bruising for his Democratic Party, President Obama heads to India on Friday to launch a 10-day Asian trip intended to expand export markets and strengthen security cooperation in what he considers a region vital to U.S. interests. The trip to India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan encompasses a G-20 summit, an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, major holidays in India and Indonesia, and bilateral talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao and at least five other leaders, as well as four presidential news conferences. It's all part of an administration focus on Asia as a strategic region in the 21st century, said Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. \"If you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia, the rise of individual countries within Asia, is one of the defining stories of our time,\" Rhodes said last week, adding, \"We see core U.S. national interests that will be advanced by us playing a key role in helping to shape the future of the region and making clear that we're an Asian and a Pacific power.\" The first stop is India, where Obama will spend three days -- the longest stay in any foreign country of his presidency so far -- to emphasize ties between the world's two largest democracies, top administration officials said. Obama has called the U.S. relationship with India a \"defining partnership of the 21st century,\" noted Bill Burns, the undersecretary of state for political affairs. \"The simple truth is that India's rise and its strength and progress on the global stage is deeply in the strategic interest of the United States,\" Burns said. \"We're the world's two largest democracies. We're both big, diverse, tolerant societies. We're two of the world's largest economies. We both have an increasing stake in global stability and prosperity, especially across Asia and the Pacific.\" Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, said India was \"one of the most important emerging economic relationships for the United States.\" \"With 1.2 billion people and an economy expected to grow at 8 percent a year for the next several years, we really see India as a potentially very important market for U.S. exports,\" Froman said. The president's itinerary in India includes a speech to the Indian Parliament, a state dinner and a wreath-laying at the grave of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. According to Rhodes, Obama departs Washington on Friday and arrives Saturday in Mumbai, where he will attend a business conference and visit the Gandhi Museum, then head to New Delhi for bilateral talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Parliament speech and the state dinner. The trip also includes a town hall-style meeting with Indian students, a celebration of the Hindu holiday Diwali and a visit to Humayun's Tomb, an architectural precursor to the Taj Mahal. Obama then heads to Indonesia to meet with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and attend a state dinner in the nation where he spent part of his childhood. The two-day visit also will include a news conference with Yudhoyono, a visit to the Istiqlal Mosque and a public speech at a to-be-determined outdoor venue to the people of the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, Rhodes said. \"In that speech, he'll have a chance to talk about the partnership that we're building with Indonesia but also to talk about some of the themes of democracy and development and our outreach to Muslim communities around the world, while also speaking of Indonesia's pluralism and tolerance as well,\" Rhodes said. \"While a Muslim majority, it's a host to a broad religious diversity, so this speech will give the president an opportunity to discuss some of the themes that many of you have heard him talk about and to do so, again, in a country where he can speak to the importance of Indonesia to him, personally, having lived there for several years in Jakarta as a boy,\" Rhodes added. The trip to South Korea is for the G-20 summit in Seoul but will include the bilateral meeting with Hu and a speech to U.S. troops stationed there on the Veterans Day holiday in the United States. Obama's talks with Hu will be their seventh bilateral meeting, along with three others the president has held with Chinese Premier Wen Jibao, for an unprecedented amount of top-level contact with China, noted Jeff Bader, the senior director for Asian affairs of the National Security Council. Bader said U.S.-Chinese relations have always included issues of cooperation and contention, and although attention focuses on the points of disagreement, he cited areas of agreement in recent years. \"We established a strategic and economic dialogue,\" Bader said. \"We've been favorable to greater Chinese participation, a greater role in the IMF and World Bank. We've worked with China, I think, quite well on Iran, on the U.N. Security Council resolution, which was a stronger resolution than anyone I think inside or outside the government would have anticipated when that process started.\" Relations with China on other issues, such as climate change and North Korea's nuclear activities, were \"complicated,\" Bader said. He didn't mention U.S. complaints that China's currency is undervalued, resulting in a trade advantage for Chinese goods over American goods that contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. Obama's Seoul visit also includes a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and a news conference, Rhodes said. A message of the trip for North Korea will be the benefits to South Korea from its partnership with the United States and the West, according to Rhodes. \"South Korea and North Korea were basically equally developed 60 years ago, and now you see a South Korea that is closely allied with the United States, that has embraced democracy, that has embraced open market reforms, is one of the most dynamic, growing economies and powers on the East Asia stage but also the world stage, as evidenced by hosting the G-20,\" Rhodes said. In Japan, Obama will speak to a CEO Business Summit that is part of the APEC meeting, take part in the APEC events and hold bilateral talks with Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It will be Obama's first meeting with Gillard since she became prime minister in August of a nation that Bader called \"a close ally\" that has supported the U.S.-led NATO mission in Afghanistan. The trip concludes with a visit to the Great Buddha statue in Yokohama, which Obama visited as a child, according to Rhodes. He said first lady Michelle Obama will accompany the president in India and Indonesia, but their daughters will remain home to continue their schooling.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Anti-government demonstrations broke out Friday in Syria after weekly Muslim prayers, with activists reporting at least 34 deaths amid clashes between security forces and protesters. The Syria Human Rights Information Link told CNN that at least 11 people died in the western industrial city of Homs when security forces fired at crowds. For two months, Syria has been torn by street protests against political repression and a fierce security crackdown against demonstrators. The government's tough and violent actions toward marchers and its thousands of mass arrests have drawn widespread criticism. Demonstrations erupted after Friday prayers in Syrian cities, as they have for weeks. The United States has imposed sanctions on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and other senior officials. On Thursday, President Barack Obama singled out Syria for criticism during his speech on the Middle East. A rights activist in Homs described thick black smoke hanging over the city as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets demanding al-Assad's ouster. According to the rights activist, the demonstrators gathered from several neighborhoods around Homs. The demonstrators chanted slogans calling for the release of political detainees and demanded freedom, equality and fundamental reforms, the activist said. As the crowd grew, security forces fired shots in the air and tried to disperse the gathering. When people refused to leave, security forces fired at the throngs, killing some and wounding others, the rights activist said. Despite the eruption of violence, demonstrators remained in the streets and chanted for the downfall of the regime. The Syrian Human Rights Information Link also said 13 died in Maarat al-Numan southwest of Aleppo. Two people were killed in the western city of Deir Alzour. At least one person was killed in the turbulent southern city of Daraa, and another died in Sanamen outside Daraa. One each died in the western coastal city of Latakia, the Damascus suburb of Darya and the western city of Hama. An additional three people died in the violence, but it was not immediately clear where, the rights group said. For the first time in about 25 days, the residents of Daraa heard the call for Friday prayers over mosques' speakers, according to activist Abdullah Abazeed. Previously, all mosques, shops, schools and other businesses had been closed and a strict curfew imposed due to the military siege in the town. But an activist there said the call to prayers was \"simply a show by the Syrian government to make it seem everything is OK and back to normal.\" He said security forces surrounded four mosques Friday, but many residents shunned mosques in favor of praying in public squares. Arrests and attacks on civilian homes have continued, according to the activist. There were small protests in Daraa after Friday prayers, but no large demonstrations, he said. An eyewitness said demonstrators in the Damascus suburb of Qaboon marched toward the town's Grand Mosque, a demonstration that started with 800 people and grew to 3,000. As the group approached the mosque, a heavy security presence surrounded the demonstrators. Security personnel fired tear gas into the crowd and arrested protesters, the eyewitness said. Purported videos of protests surfaced on the Internet. The gatherings were said to be in Damascus, Homs, the city of Hama in the west and Abu Kamal in the far east of the country near Iraq. Demonstrators have blamed Syrian security for the violence, but the government has repeatedly pointed to unspecified \"armed groups\" for instigating the violence. The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency on Friday said that \"armed groups exploited gatherings of citizens in Idlib and the outskirts of Homs\" and \"opened fire on civilians and police forces, which resulted in a number of deaths and injuries.\" It said there were no confrontations or interference by security forces in other locations, where scores of people gathered in several provinces after Friday prayers and \"mostly\" dispersed after they chanted for freedom. Meanwhile, the U.N. refugee agency said Friday that people have been crossing into Lebanon from a turbulent Syrian region where violence has erupted recently. About 1,400 people have entered the Wadi Khaled and Tall Biri regions of Lebanon over the past week from the Syrian town of Tal Kalakh, the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said. The number is \"in addition to those that have crossed since late April. Local authorities estimate that around 4,000 Syrians have crossed to Lebanon,\" the agency said in a written statement. \"Many of those who have crossed the border recently have come without any belongings, having fled what they say was heavy military bombardment of Tal Kalakh and surrounding areas,\" it said. \"Most have found shelter with relatives or host families, and some are residing temporarily in a school in Tall Biri.\" Clashes between citizens and security forces have been reported for days in embattled Tal Kalakh, and witnesses there are reporting a strong security presence despite claims from the government of a troop pullout. In his address Thursday, Obama said Syrians have displayed \"courage in demanding a transition to democracy\" but the regime \"has chosen the path of murder and the mass arrests of its citizens.\" \"President Assad now has a choice: He can lead that transition, or get out of the way,\" Obama said. \"The Syrian government must stop shooting demonstrators and allow peaceful protests, release political prisoners and stop unjust arrests, allow human rights monitors to have access to cities like Daraa and start a serious dialogue to advance a democratic transition. Otherwise, President Assad and his regime will continue to be challenged from within and isolated abroad.\" Despite the international outcry against Syria, al-Assad does have support from Venezuela's president. Syria is \"the victim of a fascist onslaught,\" Chavez said Friday via Twitter. Chavez, a leftist president who has aligned himself with countries hostile to the United States, said that he spoke on Friday to al-Assad, whom he called a \"brother.\" \"God help Syria,\" Chavez tweeted. The grass-roots demonstrations began in and around Daraa in mid-March and have spread to other cities such as Homs, Banias, Douma and Latakia. Most recently, there has been unrest in Tal Kalakh. A few dozen people have been killed recently in the town near the Lebanese border, human rights activists said. The Syrian state-run news agency Thursday quoted a military source as saying that army units started withdrawing from the town \"after accomplishing their mission of ending the state of security disorder caused by outlawed armed groups.\" \"Life in the city is gradually going back to normal,\" the source was quoted as saying. But CNN spoke to one activist who said that \"army tanks pulled out of Tal Kalakh but continue to maintain their siege of the city.\" Another witness said the military remains in the city center and in the suburbs and security forces are making arrests. As for the Syrian refugees filtering into Lebanon, that country's prime minister, Saad Hariri, asked the government's High Relief Committee last week to supervise and coordinate the work with the refugees. The U.N. refugee agency has helped distribute mattresses, blankets and food. \"The proactive role taken by the Lebanese authorities to ensure that new arrivals are assisted is encouraging,\" the U.N. agency said. \"Most of the people who have crossed the border in recent weeks are women and children,\" it said. \"In addition to their immediate need for food, shelter and medical help, they also need psycho-social support. The latter is being addressed by the Ministry of Social Affairs.\" The agency said it has \"established a field presence in the north, working closely with the ministry to assess and provide needed protection interventions.\" CNN's Arwa Damon, Nada Husseini, Salma Abdelaziz, Hamdi Alkhshali and Joe Sterling contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Johnnie Tuitel, a professional motivational speaker who has flown nearly half a million miles, is no stranger to airline trouble. Even the most savvy of business travelers, like Tuitel, are not spared inconveniences due to delays, cancellations and mechanical failure. But Tuitel experienced something new last month. For the first time in his 20-year career, he said, he was ordered off a plane that had been cleared for takeoff for what could be called his own mechanical failure. Tuitel is wheelchair-bound because of cerebral palsy, a condition he has managed to turn into a source of inspiration for the national audiences he addresses regularly. \"My first reaction was to worry about my family's safety,\" Tuitel said about the request for him to get off the plane. \"I've got kids, my father's 78 years old and not in good health; I thought, 'They're going to tell me something I don't want to hear'\" They did, but it was of a different sort: He was told he was removed from the plane because of his physical condition. \"Their argument was if something were to happen, I can't help myself or somebody else, which is an assumption first of all. Second of all, the people that made the decision are not medical doctors,\" said Tuitel, 47, of East Grand Rapids, Michigan. \"They basically told me I was too disabled to fly and I had to fly with a companion and I had to purchase that companion's ticket,\" he told HLN's \"Prime News.\" The airline, US Airways, said he was ordered off the flight for his own safety. \"He did not appear to have the ability to assist himself in evacuating in the event of an emergency,\" said Michelle Mohr, a US Airways spokeswoman. \"He appeared to have a lot of difficulty moving.\" Tuitel had been on a US Airways flight from West Palm Beach, Florida, to Kansas City, Missouri, where he had a late-September speaking engagement. Tuitel said he had looked into what legal courses were available to him. The Air Carrier Access Act outlines how airlines should deal with people with disabilities, but it is unclear whether US Airways' actions violated the act's provisions. But afterwards, he told \"Prime News\" that  he would not sue. Instead, he said, he would prefer to approach the matter from a civil rights standpoint. \"It's against the law to stop me from traveling for a specific reason, and if I'm already on the plane, they violated my civil rights. It's like telling Rosa Parks you can't sit on the bus,\" Tuitel said. \"I'm not angry. I was just embarrassed because I couldn't do my job.\" US Airways' official policy on disabled passengers stipulates that \"for safety-related reasons, if a passenger has a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to physically assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft, the airline requires that the passenger travel with a safety assistant to assist the passenger to exit the aircraft in case of an emergency evacuation,\" Mohr said. \"Safety is our number one priority and we did not feel it was safe for Mr. Tuitel to fly that day,\" she said. Tuitel said that, after he was escorted off the flight, he booked a seat on Delta Air Lines and had no problems traveling alone on that flight. The airline did not contact him until nearly three weeks later, Tuitel contends, after stories began to emerge about the incident. Its only offer at that time, he said, was to reimburse him for the flight. He declined. But Friday, as the story spread to more media outlets, Mohr said US Airways' \"customer relations team had an extremely productive discussion\" with Tuitel. \"We asked Mr. Tuitel if he might be interested in working with us as a sounding board to help us continue to work toward improving our service for our customers with disabilities,\" she said. Tuitel confirmed they had \"a very productive talk.\" \"They do want to right this wrong and they do want to work with me,\" he said. \"And I am hopeful -- don't want to sound cynical but it is a big company -- I am hopeful we can come up with a solution that won't only work for the two of us but will make sure that this doesn't happen to anyone with a disability in the future.\" Rich Donovan, who is on the board of trustees of United Cerebral Palsy and also has the disease, didn't see the incident as one of negligence or an intent to discriminate on the part of US Airways. He attributed Tuitel's experience to a lack of training and a lack of clarity about policies and how they're applied to disabled travelers. \"There's a general lack of understanding of disability amongst the entire travel industry, and I think that's simply because they look at it as a compliance issue, rather than a customer-service issue,\" said Donovan, who is the chief investment officer of IPS Capital. Tuitel said he wants to make sure this doesn't happen to other disabled passengers. \"I don't want a little boy with a disability not have the opportunity to go somewhere. I don't want a young girl with a disability going out for her first job interview by herself to be told she can't fly in an airplane,\" Tuitel said. Donovan said he hopes this incident will serve as a learning experience for airlines and make customer service better. \"I think some dialogue and some handwringing and some getting down into the weeds here is what needs to happen so that this stuff doesn't occur again,\" he said. CNN's Miguel Susana and Marnie Hunter contributed to this report.",

    "input": "London (CNN) -- British field hockey authorities have been forced to apologize \"unreservedly\" to South Africa after an old national anthem from the days of apartheid was played before an international game this week. Great Britain Hockey called the mistake \"sensitive\" and \"unfortunate.\" \"It was completely shocking,\" the chief executive of South Africa hockey said of hearing the pre-1994 anthem \"Die Stem\" being played before Tuesday's game in London. \"I thought, 'What is that?' And when I listened further, I realized it was 'Die Stem.' I couldn't believe my ears,\" Marissa Langeni said Thursday. Some of the younger players on the team didn't even know what song was being played, she said. The anthem dates from the days of white minority rule over South Africa. A new national anthem, \"Nkosi Sikelel' iAfrika,\" meaning \"God Bless Africa,\" was added alongside it when Nelson Mandela became president in 1994, and the two songs were combined in 1997. \"For the majority of South Africans, we don't relate to that anthem,\" Langeni said. \"It was the anthem of a small section of our community. It's as good as not having played an anthem.\" \"If they flew the old flag of the country, I would be equally surprised,\" she said. Tournament organizer Great Britain Hockey on Wednesday published \"a full and unreserved apology to the South African women's hockey team and their supporters for mistakenly playing the wrong national anthem before South Africa's match with Great Britain.\" GBH Chief Operating Officer Sally Munday blamed the mistake on \"a contractor responsible for sports presentation at the event.\" She said organizers had not checked the anthem in advance and took full responsibility for the mistake. Langeni said she was very satisfied with the apology, calling the error \"a bit of an administrative blunder.\" South Africa beat Great Britain 3-1 in an upset.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The Syrian Army assaulted the city of Houla on May 25, murdering 90 people, 30 of them children younger than 10. Amateur video reveals rows of bodies, adults and children, riddled with bullet holes and filling makeshift morgues. Earlier, reports from Homs described people tortured, doused in gasoline and set on fire, with the death toll including men, women and children. The Red Cross announced it is withdrawing its workers in Damascus, leaving only 50 core workers, and the Arab Red Crescent has suspended its first aid efforts in Aleppo after repeated attacks on its vehicles and facilities by the Syrian army. Civilian residences are shelled with artillery and tanks and bombed from planes, day after day. What else would it take for the civilized world to conclude that the line has been crossed and decent people can no longer stand by? True, the atrocities in Syria do not compare in scope to those of the Holocaust; however, they have one major common element: They are not the work of some gangs, like those in Mexico; terrorists, like al Qaeda in Iraq; or foreign intruders, like the Pakistani Taliban in Afghanistan. They are the acts of a national government, a government that is systematically using its military to hammer its own people. Here, there are no difficulties in determining who is involved, and above all, who is in charge. The media sticks punctiliously to professional standards and keeps reminding us that this or that report about the last outrage is \"unconfirmed.\" The New York Times notes that reports on summary executions by Syrian security forces in Baba Amr remain \"unconfirmed.\" Although this or that detail may not be verifiable, the Syrian authorities do not deny that most of the reported barbaric acts have taken place. They merely claim that they are dealing with foreign terrorists and are entitled to a free hand. Q&A: What options are left in Syria? The United States and other democracies claim that they are stymied by the U.N. Security Council's refusal to authorize the use \"of all means necessary\" to stop the carnage, leaving the blood of Syrian civilians on the hands of Russia and China, who threaten to veto the kind of resolution that legalized the intervention in Libya. But when the West faced atrocities on a smaller scale in Kosovo and could not gain the U.N.'s blessing, it acted decisively and effectively. The bloodshed was stopped. If the West were to proceed in Syria, countries could point to a unanimous U.N. General Assembly resolution known as R2P, which states that all governments have a responsibility to protect their own people. The resolution warns governments that if they do not discharge this responsibility, they forfeit their right to sovereignty and the international community has not only a right to interfere, but a duty. We are told that the rebels include extreme Islamists, even al Qaeda elements, who are hostile to the West and may commit atrocities of their own. Indeed, the rebels lined up against the wall and shot dead several Bashar al-Assad loyalists in Aleppo on August 1. There is also the fear that rebels might incite a civil war among Syria's various ethnic groups, a result that would cost many additional lives. Our goal should be limited: Pressure al-Assad's regime to negotiate with the rebels on major reforms but not to hand them victory. We surely do not want to repeat the mistake we made in Iraq, in which the army and most civil servants were fired and the country plunged into anarchy and lawlessness. Above all, we must warn the rebels that we shall cease all support for them if they commit atrocities, a step we did not undertake in Libya, resulting in some very distressing consequences. Finally, we are cautioned that the Syrian military is mightier, better equipped and more able to fight than the Libyan one was. Well, it is a year and half since the Syrian conflict began, and the army so far has been unable to gain an upper hand against disorganized, poorly equipped, untrained rebels. It seems obvious that al-Assad's troops are hardly a match for the American military machine. No one in his right mind suggests that the U.S. should invade Syria. But the U.S. could bomb the command and control centers of the Syrian army and, above all, the compound of those who are responsible for the brutal slaughtering of civilians -- al-Assad and his inner circle. The goal would be to punish the leaders of this campaign, to stop the slaughtering of civilians, to force those in charge to negotiate a settlement with the rebels and to warn other tyrants who watch Syria from the sidelines that they should not believe that they could act with impunity if they were to follow a similar course. Frankly, it may be too late. The rebels might not be ready to deal with the Syrian regime, even if those who head it are replaced. And the regime might collapse and the country plunge into chaos and increased bloodshed at any moment. However, if America and its allies act, it will be clear that there is a limit to our tolerance -- that we will not hide behind the veto of Russia and China and refuse to move when large-scale crimes are committed by a government against its own people. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Amitai Etzioni.",

    "input": "NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- President George W. Bush called India's prime minister Thursday to push a proposed nuclear partnership that sparked an unsuccessful no-confidence vote against the Indian leader this week, a White House spokesman said. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh won a confidence vote despite opposition to the nuclear deal. \"Both leaders expressed their desire to see the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear issue move forward as expeditiously as possible,\" Gordon Johndroe said. The phone call took place two days after Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh narrowly survived the no-confidence vote in the lower house of Parliament. The vote was sparked by concerns from the opposition that India was kowtowing to the U.S. The tentative deal was announced in 2006 and signed by Bush and Singh a year ago. Under the agreement, which will need to be approved by the U.S. Congress, India would have access to U.S. nuclear fuel and technology for its civilian nuclear power plants. That would happen even though New Delhi, which tested nuclear weapons in 1974 and 1998, has declined to join international non-proliferation agreements. In return, India has promised that it would not transfer the fuel and equipment to its weapons program, and it would allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect at least 14 of its 22 nuclear plants. The plan would also expand U.S.-Indian cooperation in energy and satellite technology. The plan was approved by India's Cabinet last year, and does not have to be ratified by the parliament. The leaders of India's two communist parties -- which hold about 60 seats in Parliament -- have accused Singh of surrendering India's sovereignty to the United States with the deal. A no-confidence vote would have forced Singh to resign, and required the government to hold early elections unless a new coalition could have been formed. The Congress Party-led coalition has governed India since 2004. Tuesday's 275-256 vote was so crucial to the survival of Singh's government that five members of parliament serving prison sentences were freed to cast votes -- under the watchful eyes of their jailers. Shortly after Singh survived the vote, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino praised the deal as \"a good one for everybody.\" \"It's good for India because it would help provide them a source for energy that they need, one that is nonpolluting and one that doesn't emit greenhouse gas emissions,\" she said. \"And we think that we can move forward with this. If their legislature lets it move forward, then we can do the same here and then we'll be able to get this wrapped up.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A ticker tape parade awaits the New York Giants this week when the team returns home as Super Bowl champions after defeating the New England Patriots 21-17 on a last-minute touchdown. The Super Bowl victory Sunday night was the fourth for the Giants; the team defeated the Patriots 17-14 in the 2008 title game. New England fans who had hoped their team would avenge the 2008 loss were left crestfallen. But for Giants supporters, the celebration was just beginning. Early Monday, the Empire State Building was bathed in Giants blue. Later in the day, New York City will conduct a public giveaway for 250 winners for a post-parade ceremony on Tuesday at City Hall Plaza where the team will be given keys to the city. \"After nearly missing the playoffs, the Giants have made history by becoming the first NFL team to win the Super Bowl after going 9-7 in the regular season,\" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said after the Sunday night win. \"I look forward to celebrating this victory with all New Yorkers.\" Clutching the championship trophy, Giants quarterback Eli Manning, the MVP award winner, said \"I just stayed positive\" during the seesaw struggle. Assisted by crucial late receptions by Mario Manningham, Manning marched the Giants down the field in the closing minutes of the game. The go-ahead touchdown was scored by running back Ahmad Bradshaw from 6 yards out with 52 seconds remaining. But the Patriots and Tom Brady, who was vying for his fourth championship ring, weren't quite done. They moved the ball, but had only enough time for a \"Hail Mary\" pass that bounced away from receivers in the end zone. After trailing the Patriots 17-9 early in the third quarter, the Giants put up the last 12 points of the game to win 21-17. In the final three minutes of the game, Twitter saw an average of 10,000 tweets per second, the company said. An estimated 111 million U.S. TV viewers were expected to tune in to the game. Exact figures were not available early Monday morning. As in years past, many watched as much for the ads and the halftime show as for the game itself. Halftime entertainer Madonna provided an eclectic set, morphing from a Roman Empire theme to a high school cheerleader, complete with pom poms and a marching band. She led a collection of performers through a medley that included \"Vogue,\" \"Music,\" \"Like a Prayer\" and \"Give Me All Your Luvin.'\" But it was a guest performance by artist M.I.A. that generated most of the show's buzz. She gave network cameras a middle finger salute, while rapping \"I don't give a sh*t.\" The apologies from the NFL and the broadcaster, NBC, came quickly -- they blamed each other. \"There was a failure in NBC's delay system,\" said Brian McCarty, the league's vice president of communications. \"The obscene gesture in the performance was completely inappropriate, very disappointing, and we apologize to our fans.\" \"The NFL hired the talent and produced the halftime show,\" NBC said. \"Our system was late to obscure the inappropriate gesture and we apologize to our viewers.\" The episode was reminiscent of the 2004 Super Bowl when singer Janet Jackson's nipple was briefly exposed during a performance with singer Justin Timberlake. The American president who saved football . A bevy of celebrities, including Jerry Seinfeld, Clint Eastwood and Elton John, showed up in commercials during this year's broadcast. David Beckham provided eye candy in an H&M underwear ad, which tended to spend more time on his chiseled and tattooed looks than the briefs he was wearing. Another commercial featured a slimmed-down dog chasing after a Volkswagen Beetle. The ads went for a record $3.5 million per 30-second spot. Pop singer Kelly Clarkson started off the festivities with a rendition of \"The Star-Spangled Banner,\" managing to get through the lyrics without a hitch, unlike Christina Aguilera, who caught flak after botching the words at last year's game. What does Indianapolis have to offer? The city itself strove to prove it could be a major player. It kept one key goal in mind. \"I honestly think the best report would be people saying, 'The game was great and -- oh yeah, by the way, Indianapolis was really nice. I had a really good time,' \" said Tom Griswold, longtime co-host of the Indy-based syndicated radio program \"The Bob & Tom Show.\" CNN's Thom Patterson and Dan Moriarty and HLN's Jonathan Anker contributed to this report.",

People's Armed Police units equipped with armored personnel carriers take positions in Urumqi on Saturday. \"In the patients we have seen in the last couple of days, there are many which we believe were not actually punctured with needles,\" Wang Hanbin, a Peoples' Liberation Army doctor examining people in Urumqi, told reporters on Saturday at a briefing. Wang said about 20 cases are being investigated closely and samples were being taken to laboratories in Beijing for more testing. But, he said, \"many of the patients we have seen were mainly influenced by psychological factors.\" Wang, a member of a six-person military medical panel reviewing the syringe-stabbing claims, attributes the false reports to widespread fear and lack of medical knowledge. \"Many of the patients did not actually see their attacker or the act of others attacking them with needles. Some patients who had needle puncture wounds experienced some discomfort in the area of the wound, and showed some symptoms, but couldn't give an accurate account of what they perceived to have been a needle attack.\" This is the latest crisis plaguing Xinjiang province and its capital city of Urumqi, where tensions have boiled over between Uyghurs and Han Chinese. The Han Chinese are the country's dominant ethnic group, and the Uyghurs are a Turkic-speaking Muslim minority who consider Xinjiang their homeland. Ethnic Uyghurs have been blamed for the alleged syringe stabbings, and demonstrators clashed with police in Urumqi for two days this week over the issue. Protesters were demanding better police protection and a crackdown on the Uyghurs. The latest unrest left five people dead and 14 injured, according to Urumqi's deputy mayor, and the Communist party chief in the city has been dismissed from his job amid the crisis, according to state-run media reported.  Watch report on unrest in Urumqi from CNN's John Vause Â» . The Urumqi Public Prosecutors Office on Saturday said four ethnic Uyghurs were arrested in connection with three syringe-wielding incidents. At the press conference held by military medical personnel, the doctors said puncture wounds could not be found \"in a large percentage of the patients.\" \"Some could have been bitten by insects such as mosquitoes, and in other cases there were moles, or skin pigmentation, and we couldn't find a needle puncture wound,\" said Wang, speaking at the news conference. \"Maybe they heard something from someone, then they discovered that they had a growth on their body. So, then they suspect that they may have been attacked with a needle and came to seek treatment. Some patients who came to seek treatment had some red marks or rash on their skin, but we didn't find any needle puncture wounds.\" Wang urged people not to panic and urged them to immediately seek medical treatment if they think they were stabbed. He also said people need to educate themselves about medical care. Rumors have abounded in Urumqi of recent syringe stabbers trying to spread AIDS and other diseases. But another doctor, Duan Qing, explained at the briefing that would be impossible for there to be any such cases of AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or syphilis because there is a lengthy incubation period. \"Even if there are cases of such illnesses, they are unrelated to incidents. This is basic medical knowledge,\" she said. The three incidents that led to the arrests occurred in late August. A man admitted stabbing a female shopper with a pin on August 28. Authorities said a man and woman on August 29 stole money from a taxi driver after threatening him with a syringe. And in the third incident, a man resisting arrest stabbed a police officer with a syringe on August 31.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The mother of a 25-year-old woman killed in a Boston hotel more than a week ago said Friday that she will remain haunted by her daughter's death for the rest of her life. The mother of Julissa Brisman says she remains haunted by her daughter's death. \"Our family has been devastated by the loss of our beautiful daughter, Julissa,\" Carmen Guzman said in a statement released Friday, which would have been Julissa Brisman's 26th birthday. \"The feeling of losing my daughter in this way and the pain she must have felt will haunt me for the rest of my life,\" Guzman said. \"She won't live to see her dreams. We will hold Julissa in our hearts every day.\" Philip Markoff, 23, a second-year student at Boston University's School of Medicine, is charged with killing Brisman on April 14 at Boston's Copley Marriott Hotel. Police have said that Brisman, a model from New York, advertised as a masseuse on the online classifieds Web site Craigslist. They say Markoff may have met her through the online site. Prosecutors say Brisman sustained blunt head trauma, and said she was shot three times at close range. One of the bullets passed through her heart, killing her, prosecutors said. Markoff, who was arraigned Tuesday, is being held without bail. His attorney, John Salsberg, told reporters after the hearing that Markoff is \"not guilty of the charges. He has his family's support. I have not received any document or report or piece of evidence other than what I heard in the courtroom. All I have at the moment are words -- no proof of anything.\" A procedural not-guilty plea was entered on Markoff's behalf, according to Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley. Markoff is also charged in connection with the April 10 robbery of Trisha Leffler, 29, at a Westin Hotel in Boston. Leffler was robbed of $800 in cash and $250 in American Express giftcards, according to police reports. She was held at gunpoint and bound, prosecutors said. Megan McAllister, who identified herself as Markoff's fiancee, maintained his innocence in an e-mail sent to ABC News. McAllister said Markoff \"is the wrong man\" and \"was set up.\" \"Unfortunately, you were given wrong information as was the public,\" she wrote. \"All I have to say to you is Philip is a beautiful person inside and out and could not hurt a fly!\" Authorities believe the motive in Brisman's death was robbery, Conley told reporters. In executing a search warrant at Markoff's home, police found a firearm, along with restraints and duct tape, he said. Authorities in Boston are working with police in Warwick, Rhode Island, on what could be a related case. On April 16 at a Holiday Inn Express in Warwick, a man tied up and demanded money from a 26-year-old dancer who had posted a Craigslist advertisement, Warwick Police Chief Col. Stephen McCartney said. The robbery was interrupted when the woman's husband entered the room. After pointing his gun at the husband, the suspect fled, McCartney said. He said the incident \"may be related to similar crimes occurring in the Boston area\" but that had not been determined.",

At the heart of the rivalry is HiRos -- a High Resolution Optical System -- that would potentially be a leap forward in satellite surveillance. A flurry of cables obtained by WikiLeaks and published by the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten shows German officials lobbying for a \"strategic US/German partnership\" in 2009 to develop the system, amid French attempts to kill it. Some thirty pages of cables show the political maneuvering and enticing technological potential of HiRos, as well as the determination of the German space agency (DLR) to get it deployed by 2013. The cables also shows the DLR's desperation to end Germany's dependence on \"foreign sources of imagery.\" German officials were clearly sensitive about the dual intelligence and commercial use of the program. In February 2009, U.S. diplomats were told that \"to minimize possible political backlash from developing HiRos as an intelligence satellite, the program will be managed by a civil agency.\" But a later cable -- from September 2009 -- talks about HiRos' \"primary customer\" as the German intelligence service. One cable from February 2009 reveals efforts by German officials to steer development work on HiRos away from a Franco-German consortium toward a German company \"in an effort to minimize French mischief.\" Subsequently, a senior official at the German space agency said Germany \"had been pushed into a corner by the French and left little choice but to go it alone within the EU.\" The alliance with the United States, explained another official, would help prevent a French monopoly of the lucrative market for electro-optical imagery. But he was concerned by the \"fierce and persistent\" French lobbying to halt HiRos. In lobbying the U.S. embassy in Berlin, German officials said HiRos would enable Germany to be \"a better partner... by bringing more unique value to the table.\" A senior German official suggested that three German and three U.S. satellites could be deployed, with the imagery being shared. At the same time, access to U.S. imagery of China, North Korea, Iran and the Haqqani Network (a terrorist group based on the Afghan/Pakistan border) would help fill German collection gaps. U.S. diplomats were enthusiastic about HiRos -- saying the German satellite program \"has yielded sophisticated and reliable satellite systems that provide an extraordinary amount of product for their investment.\" They waxed lyrical about HiRos' \"daily revisit capability for any spot on the Earth's surface,\" and its projected ability to provide detailed 3D images. German officials also promised that HiRos would be able to process \"near real-time\" or in \"milliseconds\" data that currently takes several hours to process. HiRos remains in the project phase, despite the intense lobbying by German space agency and intelligence officials -- and optimistic noises in 2009 that they were ready to move beyond the design phase and start \"bending metal.\" CNN has reached out to the German space agency for further comment on the status and funding of HiRos. Neither the U.S. State Department nor the French Foreign Ministry would comment on the leaked cables, citing policy not to discuss classified information.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Sri Lanka ordered an end to combat operations against Tamil Tiger rebels in the country's north, the president's office said Monday. But the rebels accused the military of continuing to bomb civilians. Sri Lankan soldiers stand guard next to a tank captured from the Tamil Tigers. \"Our security forces have been instructed to end the use of heavy-caliber guns, combat aircraft and aerial weapons which could cause civilian casualties,\" according a statement from the Presidential Secretariat. A rebel Web site, Tamilnet.com, immediately accused the government of violating its own order and \"deceiving the international community.\" \"Two Sri Lanka air force fighter bombers continued to bomb civilian targets in Mu'l'li-vaaykkaal after the announcement by the Sri Lankan forces that it would not deploy heavy weapons or carry out air attacks,\" Tamilnet said, citing S. Puleedevan, director of the Tamil Peace Secretariat. \"Obviously we need to see what that means in practice,\" John Holmes, the head of U.N. humanitarian operations, said about the government announcement to end combat operations. \"But, on the face of it, I think it's good news.\" The military will now concentrate on \"saving\" and \"rescuing civilians,\" who have been caught in the fighting between government forces and rebel fighters, the presidential statement said. The government's decision followed an unscheduled meeting of the National Security Council called by President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The session included the commanders of the army, navy and air force. The developments came a day after Sri Lankan officials rejected a proposed cease-fire from the Tamil rebels, warning instead that government troops would continue a new offensive until the group surrendered, a senior government official told CNN. \"The government is firm that (the rebels) lay down their arms and surrender. We do not recognize this so-called offer,\" said Lakshman Hulugalle, director of Sri Lanka's Media Center for National Security. The Tiger leadership had asked the international community to \"pressure the Sri Lankan government to reciprocate\" on the cease-fire offer. The United States, the United Nations, the European Union and India have called for a cease-fire. The foreign ministers of three nations are due in Sri Lanka on Wednesday -- David Miliband of the United Kingdom, Bernard Kouchner of France and Carl Bildt of Sweden. The rebels' proposed cease-fire came six days after the Sri Lankan army launched a new offensive against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam (LTTE). Government troops made significant advances into rebel-held territory on Friday and Saturday, according to Sri Lankan army sources. A government-imposed deadline for the Tigers to surrender passed last Tuesday. Tens of thousands of displaced civilians currently remain wedged in a dwindling swath of territory controlled by the Tigers along the country's northeastern coast. Government troops say they have rescued 39,000 civilians trapped in the area, but a U.N. refugee agency said Friday that a wave of \"fresh displacement\" now exceeds 100,000 people.  Watch civilians describe what they are experiencing Â» . Fifty metric tons of relief supplies -- which landed in Colombo on Monday -- will be sent by UNICEF to the north to help displaced residents. UNICEF, which called the situation in the north a \"catastrophe for children,\" said the displaced lack food, water and basic medical supplies. The rebels estimate the number of civilians still located in the territory at more than 160,000. The Sri Lankan military said it \"freed 3,254 civilians from LTTE clutches\" in operations Sunday. The Tigers have been fighting for an independent state in Sri Lanka's northeast since 1983. As many as 70,000 people have been killed since the civil war began, and the group has been declared a terrorist organization by 32 countries, including the United States and the European Union.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- You can't get through a conversation with Jesse Dayton without hearing a reference to Texas at least once. Musician Jesse Dayton has branched out to a new fanbase by collaborating with Rob Zombie. He wears the name Beaumont, his birthplace, like a badge of honor and he rolls through a set list of stories about his musical collaborations in the Lone Star state with humble pride. Dayton has earned a hard core following in Texas. But his recent collaborations with rocker-turned-director Rob Zombie have earned him an unexpected fan base -- among horror movie fans. Most recently, Dayton joined Zombie to record a soundtrack for the movie \"Halloween II\" as Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures -- a gig that also earned him some time on screen.  Watch Dayton discuss his new project Â» . Dayton spoke to CNN recently about his career and newfound fan base. The following is a portion of that interview: . CNN: You have a lot of appreciation for Waylon Jennings. Dayton: I was actually on a talk show in Nashville [Tennessee] and Waylon was cooking with his wife, Jessi Colter. They were watching the show I was on because Kris Kristofferson was on. They saw me and called me the next morning and said, \"Waylon cut his finger. He wants you to come down here.\" So it was a total fluke. Waylon was like my Elvis, especially growing up. My earliest memories were my mom's 8-track in the parlor listening to Willie [Nelson] and Waylon. CNN: You are not really part of the Nashville music scene. Why? Dayton: I'm not intentionally staying away from what's going on in Nashville. I'm just being myself. Texas is like a whole other planet. Bob Wills got kicked off the Grand Ole Opry. Willie Nelson didn't get on the radio until he left Nashville. There's a long history of that. I don't put down Nashville. They're just doing what they're supposed to do, which is sell as many records as they can. But we've just learned that there's a whole crowd of people out there that love Johnny Cash but aren't into what they're playing on country radio. That's been the crowd we're attracting. The cool thing we love about having a cult following is that radio and record companies can never take that away from us. It's something we went out and earned one fan at a time. I love looking out in the crowd and seeing one guy with a cowboy hat on, one guy with long hair from the Rob Zombie camp and maybe some rockabilly kids. CNN: What is the story behind your collaboration with Rob Zombie in 2005? Dayton: He said, \"Hey man, we're making the ultimate white trash horror movie called 'The Devil's Rejects.' We think your music would be perfect for it\" which is kind of a left-handed compliment, I guess. CNN: Now you're appearing in \"Halloween II\" and recorded a soundtrack for the movie? Dayton: It's really fun for me. We're taking on this whole identity of this band. The record's going to be called \"Captain Clegg and the Night Creatures.\" [Zombie] would call me and say, \"Hey, I got this idea for this song called 'Doctor Demon and the Robot Girl' \" or [he would ask me to write] a sort of '60s country thing-meets Tom Jones. CNN: Are you a good actor? Dayton: Elvis said, \"The only thing worse than seeing a bad movie is being in one.\" I think the only thing worse than watching a bad actor is being one. I don't take it seriously at all. I'm just a musician who's there for color. If I can show up and be myself and not have to act? Perfect.",

The rapper, whose real names is Jeffrey Atkins, pleaded guilty in December to attempted criminal possession of a weapon after police found a loaded semi-automatic firearm -- with the serial number scratched off -- hidden in the backseat of his luxury Maybach sedan, according to a statement from the Manhattan's district attorney. The incident occurred on New York's Upper West Side in July 2007, the statement said. He will be sent to New York's Rikers Island before being assigned to another facility in upstate New York, said his publicist, Courtney Barnes. In the months leading up to his surrender date, Atkins has been putting the finishing touches on a new album -- his first in six years -- that is scheduled to be released later this summer, Barnes said. Atkins has won MTV Video Music Awards, Source Awards, a BET Award, a GQ Man Of The Year Award, an NAACP Image Award, a World Music Award and a Teen Choice Award, according to the publicist's statement. He was also nominated for a Grammy Award in 2001. In an interview on the TV show \"Good Day New York\" this month, Atkins said growing up in Queens, he felt almost groomed for prison and knew \"a lot\" of friends who were locked up. In the interview, he said he regrets what his imprisonment will mean for his family. \"I've got three kids,\" he said. \"If there was anything that I regret, I regret that they have to go through this with me, and I'm not going to be there for them.\" CNN's Denise Quan and Alan Duke contributed to this report .",

    "input": "Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's prime minister acknowledged on Sunday he did not expect protesters would use weapons and apply violence toward authority. Speaking on national television, Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva made the admission a day after he rejected a call from anti-government protesters to dissolve the country's parliament in 30 days. Abhisit said other groups' political opinions must be taken into consideration before any such action is taken. More than two dozen civilians and military personnel have died since protesters began occupying key tourism and shopping areas in Thailand's capital. The demand from the anti-government protesters, known as the \"Red Shirts,\" was the latest in a long list issued since the group stormed parliament in early April and Abhisit declared a state of emergency. Red Shirt leaders offered Friday to return to the negotiating table -- but only if the government meets certain demands, including lifting a state of emergency and accepting responsibility for the deaths of protesters earlier this month, said Weng Tojirakarn, a co-leader of the group. iReport: Are you there? Share your story, images . On the government's side, spokesman Panitan Wattanayagorn told CNN Saturday that there was no counter-proposal to get the negotiations back on track. \"We need to make sure negotiations take place under a conducive environment,\" Panitan said, explaining that previous attempts to talk to opposition leaders had been derailed due to threats against government officials. Other conditions that must be met before any negotiations could take place include having protest leaders make sure there will be no further expansion of demonstrations into other districts and no threats to government officers, the government spokesman said. \"These conditions are very critical for peaceful negotiations,\" Panitan explained. \"Negotiation is the only way out in the end, but... we need to stabilize the situation first.\" He cited the fact that several demonstrations were taking place \"by different 'shirts' and colors,\" and said that all demonstrators must observe the rule of law and \"peace and civility will be restored first.\" His remarks came as tension remained high on the streets of Bangkok, where a political standoff has gripped the country for several weeks. The Red Shirts have been clashing with the Thai military in a Bangkok area that serves as a financial hub. Another co-leader of the Red Shirts, Veera Muskapong, met with foreign diplomats Friday and told them he might meet with the government if it meets certain conditions. Abhisit, meanwhile, huddled with the chiefs of the country's armed forces early Friday after a string of grenade attacks killed at least one person and wounded dozens of others. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban said in a televised address that the grenades were launched from the area where the Red Shirts have been encamped for weeks, but the protesters denied any responsibility for the attacks. Watch red shirt protests . Suthep told Thai television earlier that three people died in the attacks, but Bangkok's Erawan Emergency and Rescue Center later revised the number to one. At least 87 people were wounded, the center said. Col. Sansern Kaewkamnerd, spokesman for the Centre for the Resolution of the Emergency Situation (CRES), said at his daily news conference Saturday that the protests remain manageable at this time and therefore, authorities would not try to disperse the demonstrations. He did charge, however, that \"terrorists\" were interspersed among \"innocent demonstrators.\" The official said authorities would suppress the terrorists at the appropriate time, but did not want to complicate the situation by trying to take action against them now. Sansern also dismissed rumors of discord between the government, police and military forces, saying that representatives of all those entities were meeting daily to discuss the situation. Explainer: What are the protests in Thailand about? The Thai Department of Special Investigation warned Friday that those responsible for the grenade attacks could face the death penalty, the MCOT news agency reported. The attacks prompted the U.S. State Department to issue a travel alert advising American citizens of the escalating violence in Bangkok. Suthep said riot police and helicopters were deployed to join Thai troops in the affected area, which was still littered with glass amid the standoff. Across the barricades, the Red Shirts were playing music and trying to encourage a festive atmosphere. Demonstrators told CNN late Thursday they wanted to drive home the point that their rallies are supposed to be peaceful. Thrown into the volatile mix are a group of protesters who called themselves the Multicolored Shirts, made up of mainly middle-class city dwellers, who took to the streets in large numbers Friday. They are not pro- or anti-government, but simply want the government to shut down the Reds to end the violence and interruptions to daily life. Some fear that the emergence of such groups could spark a civil war. \"I am so afraid that people will do the wrong thing and think they are brave and fight and they all have arms and that is what I am afraid (of),\" said resident Josh Orajan. He said the Thai are all one people and this shouldn't be happening. The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. They want Abhisit to dissolve the government, hold new elections and leave the country. CNN's Arwa Damon and Kocha Olarn contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korea and the United States began assembling ships for joint war exercises Sunday off the west coast of the Korean peninsula in the Yellow Sea, a source at the South Korean Joint Chiefs told CNN. The exercises are set to begin as diplomats worked to ease tensions in the Koreas after North Korea warned of unpredictable \"consequences\" if the United States fulfills its vow of deploying an aircraft carrier to the Yellow Sea for joint military maneuvers with South Korea. The exercises are scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. Sunday (1 a.m. ET). China's foreign minister spoke with his Russian, U.S., and Japanese counterparts, and a Chinese representative visited Seoul as envoys underscored the need to lower the temperature in the longtime flash-point region, days after four South Koreans died when North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island. North Korea said the South provoked the Tuesday attack because shells from a South Korean military drill landed in the North's waters. South Korea was holding its annual Hoguk military drill when the North started its shelling, and the South returned fire. North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency on Saturday slammed South Korea and the United States for provoking the crisis. It called reports of civilian casualties part of South Korea's \"propaganda campaign\" and accused the \"enemy\" of creating \"a human shield by deploying civilians around artillery positions and inside military facilities before the launch of the provocation.\" \"If the U.S. brings its carrier to the West Sea of Korea at last, no one can predict the ensuing consequences,\" said KCNA, referring to the aircraft carrier USS George Washington, which is set to join South Korea's forces near the coasts of China and North Korea for the four-day military drill scheduled to start Sunday. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Nicole Thompson called the claims \"outrageous.\" \"This is just another example of North Korea's own internal propaganda. The North Koreans for many years, including the Cheonan warship incident, have taken provocative action. This didn't have anything to do with U.S. actions,\" Thompson told CNN, referring to the sinking of a South Korean ship in March that left 46 people on board dead. The United States and South Korea blame the sinking on the North, which has consistently denied responsibility. Diplomats, seeking a lessening of tensions and a return to the six-party talks with North Korea over the country's nuclear aspirations, busily labored to avert more hostilities. The United States, China, Japan, Russia, South Korea and North Korea are the six countries that have been involved in the talks, which were put on hold in 2008. \"These parties should call on the DPRK and South Korea to exercise calmness and restraint and hold dialogue and make contacts, and not to take actions that would escalate the conflict,\" China's official Xinhua news agency quoted Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi as saying. China is North Korea's largest trading partner. Yang and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov \"stressed the need to prevent the situation from exacerbating and to work toward relieving the tensions,\" according to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Xinhua reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara said his country \"is willing to work together with China to joint safeguard peace and stability on the Korean peninsula.\" And a Twitter message from U.S. State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke with Yang on Friday and \"encouraged Beijing to make clear that North Korea's behavior is unacceptable.\" Meanwhile, Dai Bingguo, a Chinese state councilor, sat down with South Korean Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan in Seoul to discuss the tensions. The violence has sparked anger and political turmoil in South Korea. The country's defense minister, Kim Tae-young resigned after the exchange of fire, and veterans of the South Korean military protested Saturday on the streets of Seoul, stating they were angry that their country's government had not done enough to respond to the North's shelling. One group of protesters gathered near the defense ministry building Saturday, clashing with police officers with some charging and kicking officers. Two South Korean marines were among the four killed in the shelling. Hundreds of mourners attended their nationally televised funeral Saturday, weeping before photos of the two men set among an array of flowers. As for Sunday's joint military exercises, China appeared to criticize them Friday and Chinese analysts warned against the United States and South Korea embarking on \"sensitive and provocative military actions.\" \"We oppose any party to take any military acts in our exclusive economic zone without permission,\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei said in a statement, Xinhua reported. But the United States has described the drill as defensive in nature. The exercises were planned months ago, and are meant to underscore strong ties between South Korea and the United States, defense officials from both countries have said. There will be no live firing element in the drills; live firing exercises can only take place in a designated training range or in a closed-off area at sea, Cmdr. Jeff Davis, public affairs officer for the U.S. 7th Fleet, and such firing exercises are not possible given the amount of traffic in the area. The drills will include anti-air attack and anti-surface-attack exercises, communications and data drills, expert exchanges, logistical support, and replenishment drills. For example, a Korean oil tanker will refuel a U.S. ship, Davis said. But the prospect of more violence has prompted alarm across the region. Japan's Kyodo news agency reported that Japanese \"Cabinet members have been ordered to stay in Tokyo until Wednesday and be at their ministry offices within an hour in the event emergency situations develop.\" South Korea said Thursday that it will strengthen its rules of engagement in the Yellow Sea. South Korean marine forces based in five islands near North Korea and the disputed Northern Limit Line also will be reinforced, a government spokesman said. The tense maritime border between the two Koreas has become the major military flash point on the Korean peninsula in recent years. The Yeonpyeong attack was the first direct artillery assault on South Korea since 1953, when an armistice ended fighting, though both Koreas are still technically at war. Journalist Andrew Salmon and CNN's Stan Grant and Tim Schwarz contributed to this report.",

Mohammad Mostafaei had barely made it to his hotel in Istanbul before diplomatic officials rushed to the scene and announced he was not safe. They swept him away in a car for his safety. \"After six days [in detention], I'm so tired I just want to go to my hotel and take a shower,\" Mostafaei said to CNN. \"I feel like I'm still in detention.\" He has had to make difficult, life-altering decisions in recent weeks. The lawyer has been a longtime defender of Iranian juveniles facing the death penalty. More recently, he campaigned to attract international attention to the case of Sakineh Ashtiani, the 43-year-old mother of two who was sentenced to death by stoning after she was convicted of adultery. On July 24, as activists around the world staged protests against Ashtiani's death sentence, Mostafaei was taken in by Iranian authorities for hours of interrogation. After they released him, he said, he went into hiding. Around the same time, he said, Iranian security forces detained his wife and brother-in-law. The brother-in-law has been released, but Mostafaei said his wife Fereshteh is still being held in solitary confinement without charge. \"I am extremely worried about my wife and her safety,\" Mostafaei said in an earlier interview with CNN. \"They [the Iranian authorities] told me if you don't turn yourself in, we will not let your family go,\" Mostafaei added. \"I made a decision, after I saw that they were still going to arrest me and mistreat me, that I must leave Iran. It was a very hard decision.\" He added, \"The truth is even when someone talks about Parmida and says her name, it's really hard for me to talk and I want to cry when that happens.\" Like many other Iranian dissidents, Mostafaei slipped across the border from Iran to the eastern Turkish border town of Van. He blames himself for his detention, which began after he landed at the Istanbul airport from Van. \"It was my mistake. I went to the police officers inside the airport and declared myself as a refugee,\" he said on Friday. According to Turkish law, refugees requesting asylum must go through a registration process with the Turkish government and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Normally it can take two years before a refugee is processed and granted asylum in another, typically Western country. But officials at the Turkish foreign ministry told CNN that in Mostafaei's case, he was likely to be granted asylum in a European country within days. According to the refugee agency's Ankara office, around 4,100 Iranian citizens currently are registered in Turkey and awaiting asylum in third-party countries. Metin Corabatir, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees' representative in Ankara, estimates that \"on a monthly basis there has been an increase of 25 to 50\" Iranians requesting asylum, compared with before the Iranian government launched a crackdown on opposition activists following a controversial presidential election on June 12, 2009. Corabatir said 150 to 200 Iranians now request asylum in Turkey every month. In his conversation on Friday with CNN, Mostafaei expressed concern for the welfare of his imprisoned wife and his daughter, whom he left behind in Iran with her grandmother. He said he also worries about clients like Ashtiani. \"Who else will do my work?\" he asked. Ashtiani, a mother of two, is reportedly still being held in Tabriz prison. Iran's judiciary could reinstate her sentence of death by stoning, execute her by other means, or possibly even grant her a reprieve, according to human rights groups.

    "input": "Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Toyota announced Thursday it was testing all its SUVs after it suspended worldwide sales of the Lexus GX 460 because of a reported risk of rollover. The carmaker does not plan to suspend the sales of other vehicles it's testing, said Ririko Takeuchi, a spokeswoman. But it will suspend Lexus GX 460 sales. Testing will include current models of Toyota's Rav4, FJ Cruiser, Highlander, 4Runner, Sequoia, Land Cruiser and Sienna, said Paul Nolasco, a Toyota spokesman in Tokyo. \"Toyota is testing not only the GX, but other SUVs simply because we want to make sure everything is right for our customers. Customer safety is our top priority,\" Nolasco said. \"There has been no indication there would be any problem in the other vehicles, so, for the time being as soon as we have results of those tests, including the test of the GX, we'll be sure to make those public.\" Is Toyota 'moving forward' as its tagline says? Suspension of GX 460 sales is another blow on the automaker, which recalled about 8 million vehicles earlier this year because of multiple problems. Consumer Reports magazine warned readers Tuesday not to buy the GX 460 because it could flip over in hard turns. Shortly after the magazine issued its warning, Toyota announced it was suspending sales of the luxury vehicle in the United States and Canada. Toyota spokeswoman Mieko Iwasaki said Thursday that the company was expanding the suspension to the Middle East and Russia, the only other markets where it was sold. \"We have no specific target in mind when to resume the sales,\" she said. \"We are now investigating the case by trying to replicate the situation that Consumer Reports pointed out.\" Consumer Reports said it judged the 2010 model to be a safety risk after a problem cropped up during standard emergency-handling tests. \"When pushed to its limits on our track's handling course, the rear of the GX we bought slid out until the vehicle was almost sideways before the electronic stability control system was able to regain control,\" the magazine reported. \"We believe that in real-world driving, that situation could lead to a rollover accident, which could cause serious injury or death. We are not aware, however, of any such reports.\" The editors said their concern about rollover risk was magnified because the vehicle has a high center of gravity. The magazine urged owners to drive carefully when exiting the highway or driving on twisty roads while the carmaker prepares a software update for the stability-control system. Toyota put total sales at 5,400 in North America, 400 in the Middle East and 140 in Russia. In its response, Toyota said its engineers conducted similar tests and found no such issues.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Udinese have gone top of the Italian Serie A table on goal difference from Lazio after captain Antonio Di Natale was again on target in a 2-1 victory over Siena on Sunday. With previous leaders Juventus seeing their match against Napoli called off because of torrential rain, Udinese, Lazio and Milan all exploited the situation with wins, dropping Juve to fourth place. Udinese took the lead after just 54 seconds against Siena, when Dusan Basta prodded the ball home from close range. And the prolific Di Natale doubled the advantage in the 64th minute when he cut inside a defender to finish Pablo Armero's long ball. Siena pulled a goal back 13 minutes from time when Francesco Bolzoni fired home Emanuele Calaio's header on the half-volley, but the home side held on to move onto 21 points from their 10 games. Lazio are level on point, but have just a single goal inferior goal difference following a 1-0 home win over Parma. Giuseppe Sculli poked home the winner with just five minutes remaining to leave Edy Reja's side firmly in the championship race. However, the performance of the day came from Milan, who are ominously just a point behind in third position after thrashing Catania 4-0. Zlatan Ibrahimovic opened the scoring with a seventh minute penalty after Davide Lanzafame fouled Robinho in the area. Brazilian striker Robinho then helped himself to the second goal in the 24th minute, curling the bal home after Ibrahimovic had sent him clear on the left wing. The same two players combined again for a 69th minute third goal, with Robinho's strike being bundled over the line by back-tracking defender Francesco Lodi. And Gianluca Zambrotta added the icing on the cake for Milan three minutes later when he was on hand to score after Alberto Aquilani's free-kick had been fumbled.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- An 87th minute header from beleaguered striker Andy Carroll handed Liverpool a 2-1 victory over Merseyside rivals Everton in the semifinal of the English FA Cup on Saturday. Carroll's effort compounded a miserable second half for David Moyes' team after a promising opening to the match played at Wembley Stadium. Nikica Jelavic pounced on a mix up between Liverpool defender's Jamie Carragher and Daniel Agger in the 24th minute to side-foot past goalkeeper Brad Jones to hand Everton the lead. It stayed that way until the 62nd minute when Sylvain Distin's sloppy back-pass gifted Liverpool a way back into the game. Luis Suarez raced onto the mistake before comfortably beating Tim Howard with the outside of his right boot to level the scores. Liverpool perhaps should have been ahead earlier in the half when Andy Carroll missed a gilt-edged chance to equalize but somehow directed his header wide. But the $55 million man made amends rising above Everton's Marouane Fellaini to nod home the winner from a Craig Bellamy free-kick. \"It's the best feeling ever. We worked hard and getting the goal right there at the end was great,\" Carroll told ESPN afterwards. \"I had a few chances and should have probably scored earlier. But I kept at it and it was a great ball in by Craig (Bellamy), and I just had to score with that one and I did. \"It's a great feeling. I've had some criticism but I've just kept on going,\" Carroll added. His manager Kenny Dalglish, who has also been the subject of criticism after Liverpool's poor league form in recent weeks, was delighted with the effort of his team. \"I think it was fantastic and although it's not been too good in the league recently, that's two cup finals -- one we've won and won we're looking forward to,\" Dalglish told ESPN. FA Cup gives Dalglish opportunity to repay owners' faith . Chelsea take on Tottenham Hotspur in the second semifinal on Sunday. The final will be played on Saturday May 5. Meanwhile in the English Premier League, Carlos Tevez scored a hat-trick for Manchester City on Saturday in the English Premier League as Manchester City thrashed Norwich City 6-1 at Carrow Road. The win closes the gap on leaders Manchester United to just two points who play Aston Villa at Old Trafford on Sunday. The Argentine put City ahead in the 18th minute, before his compatriot Sergio Aguero added a second nine minutes later. Andrew Surman's goal for Norwich six minutes after the break gave home fans hope of a comeback but four goals from City in the final quarter of the match killed off the game. Tevez bagged his second in the 73rd minute as did Aguero two minutes later to make the game safe. Tevez, who was starting only his second league game since last September, claimed his hat-trick ten minutes from the end, with Adam Johnson completing the rout in injury time to boost City's goal difference to plus 58, eight ahead of United. In the other three Premier League fixtures played Saturday, the teams struggling at the foot of the table all had days to forget. Wolverhampton Wanderers played out a goalless draw against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light -- a result that does little to alleviate their plight at the bottom of the league. Second-from-bottom Blackburn Rovers were beaten 3-0 by Swansea City, while 16th-placed Queens Park Rangers went down 1-0 against West Bromwich Albion at the Hawthorns.",

A teenager in Ireland recently found the bottle and message he tossed off the Florida coast last year. \"I was excited and amazed that my bottle traveled all the way across the Atlantic Ocean,\" said Swearingen, 18. But Swearingen's message wasn't an SOS. It was part of an experiment in his marine science class at Florida's Melbourne High School that started 16 months ago. \"The goal was to basically see how the ocean currents work and how the Gulf Stream flows, and eventually it landed in Ireland,\" he said. Swearingen says 17-year-old Adam Flannery and his father made the discovery. \"He was walking along the shore, and he saw the bottle and opened it,\" Swearingen said. \"The message said, 'Please do not throw this away. This is a science experiment.'\" The note directed the pair to contact science teacher Ethan Hall, which they did. By this time, Swearingen had graduated from high school and was attending Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, Florida. Hall tracked him down through Facebook and sent him a message with the incredible news. Swearingen said he had yet to speak with the Irish duo who found the bottle, but was looking forward to hearing their take on the find. This is not the first time Hall's experiment has proven successful, according to Swearingen. People in Georgia, South Carolina and Rhode Island have discovered bottles from other students in Hall's class. Still, Swearingen didn't expect anyone would ever find his bottle. But he said the fact that it travelled thousands of miles ensured he learned a lesson from the experiment -- more than a year after taking part in it. \"I learned that the Gulf Stream goes really, really far away,\" he said.",

Sharapova, second favorite behind Serena Williams to win the final grand slam of the season, flirted with defeat before seeing off British teenager Heather Watson, 3-6 7-5 6-3. 19-year-old Watson led by a set and a break before Sharapova fought back to force a decider. An early break gave the Russian third seed the cushion to wrap up victory, but it was hardly a convincing performance. Kvitova had been set to open on the main Arthur Ashe stadium court, but organizers switched her to the smaller Louis Armstrong court as they made changes to the schedule after Tropical Storm Irene blew through New York over the weekend. 49th-ranked Dulgheru never looked back after taking the first set tiebreaker 7-3 and broke her Czech opponent to lead 5-3 in the second set before serving out for victory to love.

Coach Mourinho has signed an extended deal ending fears he could wave goodbye to Inter Milan. Former Chelsea supremo Mourinho took charge at Italian giants Inter a year ago following the departure of Roberto Mancini and has just guided the club to their fourth straight scudetto. They also won the Italian Super Cup, but were eliminated by defending champions Manchester United in the first knockout round of the Champions League. A statement on the Inter Web site read: \"In response to the wish of the coach to continue the project started together a year ago, a wish welcomed with pleasure by the club as a sign of attachment and winning spirit, FC Internazionale announces the extension of Jose Mourinho's contract until 30 June 2012.\" Mourinho had promised the fans more titles would be on the after lifting his first Italian title, but the eal issue refused to go away until Monday's statement. When asked about the chance he could leave Inter, Mourinho had earlier told the club Web site: \"There is still a 0.01% (chance). But for me this is not an important number, it just means that I am closer to Inter than to Real. \"I am satisfied with the relationship with the fans and with my players. I repeat, I am closer to staying at Inter than going elsewhere.\" Those comments failed to impress Inter president Massimo Moratti, but the extended contract has settled any differences. Mourinho made his mark at Porto in 2004 when he led the Portuguese team to the Champions League title, beating Monaco 3-0 in the final, before moving to Chelsea. At Stamford Bridge he claimed the Premier League title in each of his first two seasons and the FA Cup the following campaign, but left the club in September 2007. Not all Inter fans have warmed to the Portuguese since his arrival in Milan last summer. He has been involved in several disagreements with the Italian media and his style of play has has not endeared him to parts of the Nerazzurri faithful.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- China's economy is booming and Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum's visit there this week highlights the U.A.E.'s ambitions to join in on this growth. CNN's John Defterios (JD) sits down with Shaukat Aziz (SA), former Prime Minister to Pakistan to talk about the emerging relationship. Former Pakistani Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz . Aziz is an expert in global banking who worked in the Middle East for a number of years as an official for Citigroup. He was an influential player in the process of creating a free trade agreement between Pakistan and China, after visiting the country in 2005. Shaukat Aziz talks about the growing ties between China and the Middle East, and gives us inside knowledge on doing business in China. (SA): I think the two economies are complementary. China is a global economy which is growing rapidly. It has one of the highest growth rates in the world, and it is expanding its footprint all over the world. Dubai and the U.A.E. is clearly a hub for South Asia, the Middle East, and the whole region. They are a trading center, they are a financial center, and they don't compete directly with China, in fact both economies will compliment each other. I think the U.A.E. Prime Minister's trip will help to further reinforce this and get the two countries closer together, in trade, in financial flows, in linking capital markets and many other initiatives. (JD): Trade has been growing 30 to 40 percent over the last four years. But can it move beyond hard Chinese goods going into the Gulf? (SA): Of course it can. I think the nature of Dubai is such that it has now become the clearing house for goods from all over the world. And buyers go to Dubai and look for the best product at the best price. So, if China, being a large country, can bring its products to Dubai, it will help both countries. May I also say that I see China evolving as an exporter of capital, not just goods because China is running huge surpluses. Their reserves are at an all time high. So they are looking for investments too, and you see now a trend in Chinese companies to buy companies overseas. A trend in Chinese companies to invest overseas because they want, once they go global, they want production facilities all over the world. So the design and the research and development will be done in China, the components will come from China, but the manufacturing could move across the world. This trend is already started and I think this will all go well for both countries. (JD): Lets take it a step further. Do you see Chinese investment funds or Sovereign Funds and U.A.E. sovereign funds going out together to acquire companies in the near future? (SA): Sure, there have been situations where both have participated in different companies. (JD): But separately. (SA): Separately, but I think they could join too. But the real issue on sovereign funds is being represented in certain quarters as if this is something which is unhelpful to the global economy. In my view, in an era of globalization we must open up our markets for investments and let anybody come along in line with the rules of that country. May I say that the sovereignty of any country is a very robust concept. And if a foreign sovereign fund or investor comes along and buys a bank in a particular country, the countries sovereignty is never jeopardized. But, if you have good regulators and good policies, because even in a deregulated environment, regulation is necessary. Deregulation does not mean abdication by the government, so if your regulatory regime is sound, you don't have to worry. Sovereign funds have demonstrated that they have helped promote economic activity, help save certain companies, banks as a case in point. And it's a win-win for both sides. So I think this question of their role is over stated. (JD): Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah went to visit China when he came into power in early 2006. Is itinevitable that U.S.-European Allies in the Gulf turn to the East now and look for new partnerships in an East-East equation? (SA): This is the fastest growing economy in the world. It is absorbing foreign investment, it is exporting investment. It is the largest producer of goods and services now, in terms of growth rate. So Saudi Arabia, naturally, the largest economy in the Middle East by a long margin, needs to link up a country like China. I think it is not geo-politics which is driving it. It is economic necessity. It is tapping into growth. Saudi companies are investing in China. I know that in the energy sector Aramco has gone in for joint ventures and maybe SABIC too, and that is to me a very positive development. Because it is showing that capital looks for opportunities and if there is return China is not far enough. E-mail to a friend .",

On Saturday night, for the first time, Iranians were the headline performers at New York City's famed Carnegie Hall.  A father and son from Iran led American musicians in a hybrid session of traditional Iranian and classical Western music. Thirty-year-old Hafez Nazeri told CNN he was pleased to present \"another dimension of Iran and Iranian culture to the Western people.\" Nazeri, who now lives in the United States, said, \"We hear mostly about the other side -- bloodshed, chaos -- and I wanted to be able to present the reality of our culture, which is about peace and love and unity.\" Nearly 3,000 people, many of them Persians, flocked to Carnegie Hall for the concert. One patron said, \"The message was completely obvious: Love all the way. Peace!\" The Nazeris said it was an honor to be onstage at the historic music center. The younger Nazeri said his music might be able to bridge cultural divides between Iran and the United States. His father, Shahrem, still lives in Iran. Speaking in Farsi, the man known as the Iranian Pavarotti talked about the demonstrations that followed June's disputed Iranian presidential election. The tenor said some of the people in the streets are \"requesting something, and I think it's important to answer to their requests. The government should answer to their requests and they have to see what their people want.\" The Nazeris are two of the few Iranian musicians allowed to freely travel and perform in Iran. Western-style popular music is banned in Iran. With just a few musicians, they form a rare group, blending Persian traditional themes with Western classical style. It's very simple in presentation: a cello, percussion and an improvised setar -- a Persian instrument like a lute -- played by Hafez Nazeri. The Nazeris' music is based on the 13th-century Persian poet and philosopher Rumi. \"The idea of the music is to bring unity and to be able to create a music that is not just for Iranians, it's for people from all over the world,\" the younger Nazeri said. Rachel Cooper, director of cultural programs and performing arts at the Asia Society, said, \"You're seeing the Iranian culture and the Western culture in something that's a kind of hybrid, that I think represents the times that we live in.\" The Nazeris receive cultural support from the nonprofit New York-based Asia Society, Cooper told CNN. \"We've been going through this time period where we've been thinking about the Berlin Wall coming down, and throughout that period of the Cold War, cultural relations were always a really important component. So I think that cultural relations -- music in particular -- are a really important part of how we know each other as human beings,\" Cooper said. The Nazeris have performed in cities across the United States in recent years.",

    "input": "Rome (CNN) -- Vatican police who searched the apartments of the pope's former butler, Paolo Gabriele, as they investigated a suspected leak told a court Wednesday how they found more than 1,000 important documents among a stash of hundreds of thousands. Among them were original papers signed by Pope Benedict XVI, some of them stamped with an order for destruction, according to a briefing from the small pool of journalists allowed to attend the trial in a Vatican courthouse. The former butler declared himself innocent Tuesday of a charge of aggravated theft in connection with leaked documents -- but said he had abused the pope's trust. Testifying Wednesday, Officer Silvano Carli said that among the huge quantity of documents found in Gabriele's possession, \"more than 1,000, both original and photocopies, were of interest.\" Police also found many newspaper clippings and printouts from Internet searches, the court heard. Much of the material had a religious or spiritual theme, touching on Buddhism, Christianity, Catholicism and yoga. Other articles concerned Freemasonry. The four officers said that it had taken them almost eight hours to search through the papers accumulated by Gabriele and that they had found \"important\" documents mixed in with irrelevant material as if it \"had been hidden.\" As well as the documents, a gold nugget belonging to the pope and a check made out to the pontiff were found in a shoebox. Pope's butler leaked papers to shock 'corrupt' Church, prosecutor says . The officers said they had searched the apartment mainly for documents and did not give \"much weight\" to the discovery of the gold nugget and signed check because they \"knew that it was Gabriele's job to handle the gifts the pope received during his trips.\" They also seized a couple of computers, an iPad, a hard drive and USB drives. In total, 82 boxes of evidence were collected from Gabriele's apartments in Vatican City and Castel Gondolfo, a small town near Rome. Gabriele has previously admitted taking hundreds of secret papers from the pope's personal apartment and passing them to an Italian journalist. The evidence heard Wednesday is expected to be the last before the trial wraps up Saturday, when the prosecutor and defense lawyer are due to give their closing statements and rebuttals. Gabriele also has the right to speak again before the three lay judges retire to consider their verdict, which could come Saturday. He asserted his innocence during his own testimony Tuesday, but added: \"I feel guilty of having betrayed the trust that the Holy Father gave me.\" Gabriele insists that he made no personal gain from collecting the documents and that he had no accomplices.

Corruption claims resulting from the publication of a book based on the leaked materials rocked the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church and could even affect who becomes the next pope. If convicted of aggravated theft, Gabriele could face up to eight years in an Italian prison, although it is possible the pontiff could pardon him. Computer technician Claudio Sciarpelletti, who worked in the Vatican's secretariat of state, is accused of complicity in the crime. The court will try him separately, once the former butler's trial is finished. Sciarpelletti would face a shorter prison term of only a few months if found guilty. Prison terms handed down by the court are served in the Italian prison system, under an agreement between the Vatican city-state and Italy. Gabriele was arrested in May, following a top-level Vatican investigation into how the pope's private documents appeared in the best-selling book \"Sua Santita\" (\"His Holiness\"), by Italian journalist Gianluigi Nuzzi. The Vatican called the publication of his book \"criminal\" when it was released in Italian.",

The company Haeftling, which in English means inmate, has just opened its first store in Berlin. \"We want to have basic, durable, timeless, beautiful clothes,\" said Stephan Bohle, one of the company founders. Many of the clothes, cooking aprons and even stainless steel food trays offered in the Berlin store were either designed or manufactured in jails, but not just German ones. One design shows a female comic figure that was drawn by a man sitting on death row in Texas. Bohle said part of the proceeds from sales go to organizations that support prisoners' rights and better conditions for inmates, like Amnesty International. But in some cases, money goes directly to the inmates that designed certain pieces. \"In the case of the female cartoon figure, this man was almost granted a stay from execution because of the design he did for us but in the end unfortunately the appeals court ruled against him,\" Bohle said . The clothes offered at the Haeftling shop also tell the story of the inmates that designed individual pieces. A small text inside the item lays out the prisoners story, including the name, where he is in jail and how long the term will be. Some of the clothes are manufactured at a corrections facility in Halle, near Leipzig, in Eastern Germany.  Watch the inmates at work Â» .

It isn't something I want to be parading around.\" But others seem to be catching the fever. Bohle said the company wants to start selling in the United States. \"We've had people from New York, Chicago and Los Angeles ask about Haeftling,\" he said in an interview in the flagship store in Berlin. Bohle said he hopes socially responsible clothes will also make for a good business for the company. E-mail to a friend .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- There are many luxurious amenities a business traveler enjoys while sleeping on the road: fluffy beds, room service, decked-out fitness centers and concierges. These amenities make traveling more comfortable. But when it comes down to it, take it from Dorothy: There's no place like home. Some business travelers say they prefer staying in furnished vacation rentals, corporate housing and inns versus hotels, particularly for lengthier stays. That's not just because alternative accommodations usually come with more space, free Wi-Fi, free laundry facilities and free parking, but doing so helps battle the lonesome blues while offering homey and off-the-beaten-path experiences. \"Living in hotels can be very depressing,\" says Mark Mule, a traveling pit orchestra musician who is usually on the road for weeks or months at a time. \"Corporate and vacation rentals are homes. This is good for your head.\" Hotel occupancy rates have slowly declined in recent years. Nationally, hotels enjoyed 63% average occupancy in 2005, according to Smith Travel Research. By the end of 2010, that figure had fallen to 57.6% (but it's up from its five-year low in 2009 of 54.6%). That's partly because of increased supply and less demand since then. As the economy recovers, travelers seek value. In a September 2010 survey by vacation rental booking site HomeAway.com, 10% of travelers say they have stayed in a vacation rental for a business trip, and 42% say they would consider a vacation rental while traveling for business. But booking a hotel still has its benefits. Survey results by market research group PhoCusWright show that hotels are, by far, the first-choice venue for corporate meetings and events, so staying in them is extremely convenient for attendees. Hotels providing newer, better club lounges . There's usually a fully equipped business center, maybe a pool and wait service. Members of hotel loyalty programs enjoy perks like free nights, free room upgrades, access to VIP lounges and preferential treatment. Sites like HomeAway.com, VacationRentals.com, VRBO.com, CorporateHousing.com, Wyndham Vacation Rentals (which rents the Breckenridge, Colorado, property in the photo above) and Craigslist.com have been around awhile for individuals to book short-term rentals, but new Web ventures such as AirBnB.com and Roomorama.com are making it possible for travelers to obtain cheaper rates for nightly lodging. Adventurous entrepreneurs can rent a room, but full, vacant properties are also available. AirBnB, which started in 2007, booked half of its 2 million bookings in the last six months, but it doesn't keep statistics on how many of those are business-related. The convenience of paying one price for furniture, housewares, amenities and utilities is attractive to business travelers, says Amanda Cook, director of membership and marketing for the Corporate Housing Providers Association. \"Corporate housing is ... specific to [clients'] unique needs and reduces stress for the user, which in turn makes them more productive at their jobs,\" Cook says. Saving money and hatred for nickel-and-diming are many travelers' motivations for booking alternative lodging, particularly at inns, 91% of which have free Wi-Fi and full breakfast, says Marti Mayne of the bed-and-breakfast industry's Better Way to Stay campaign. Many B&Bs also offer meal and activity packages, wine and cheese receptions, and 24/7 guest snack pantries. Other travelers seek more control over their routines. \"I almost exclusively stay in places I find through services such as AirBnB,\" says grant writer and frequent business traveler Ron Flavin. \"The reason I do this is to stay fit. Staying in an apartment with a kitchen makes it easy for me to prepare healthy meals.\" Chris Brisson, an entrepreneur and co-founder of Automizeit.com, has used vacation rental websites AirBnB.com and VRBO.com to find private, local experiences for small, off-site company meetings. One of his recent snags? A three-story beachfront mansion in Costa Rica for $225 per night. When traveling overseas for the long term, travel security expert Clinton Emerson suggests checking with the destination's U.S. Embassy, which performs security and safety checks on vetted rental properties. This helps prevent what happened to Comunicano CEO Andy Abramson, who once reserved a corporate apartment online that did not turn out as promised. \"The matter got resolved, but not without a loss of time and effort to get the kind of apartment we had reserved,\" he says. \"Given the corporate apartment rentals are usually represented by multiple agencies, the key is to work with one that's reputable and to find a company where the level of consistency is there.\" While more options are available for business travelers willing to be diligent, staying in a reputable hotel may be better when staying for the first time in a city, says Faruq Hunter, an executive vice president with GeniusCo who travels seven months out of the year. There's a better chance it will be close to the action and meet a traveler's comfort and safety standards, he adds. \"Remember the purpose of your trip,\" Hunter says. Those who don't mind getting personal could consider staying with clients and colleagues, as public relations executive Elyse Bender-Segall does. \"I have established great relationships with all of my clients and enjoy getting to know them on a personal level when I am in their towns,\" she says. \"To me, it feels more like home rather than to wake up alone in an unfamiliar hotel in a random city.\" But travelers who really miss home may opt to skip overnights altogether. \"My schedule gets so tight sometimes that I choose not to spend a night in a hotel,\" says Ismail Humet, co-founder of MyFreebeez.com. \"Instead, I take a red-eye flight back and get some sleep on the plane. Oftentimes, a last-minute upgrade to first class will cost less than a room plus meal expenses. First class is comfortable enough for me. It's more important to get back home and spend time with my family.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Wildlife officials in Colorado say they have killed a bear believed to have been involved in an attack on a teenage boy Friday morning. Park officials used 10 tracking dogs to hunt for the brazen black bear, which wandered into a heavily-populated campsite overnight. They established a scent trail by late afternoon, said spokesman Randy Hampton of Colorado Parks and Wildlife. At the end of the trail, they discovered a 200-pound  bear that matched the description of the one involved in the early morning attack. It was shot and killed. Officials had said earlier they would have to kill the bear, pointing to the bold and aggressive behavior it exhibited when it wandered into the site with so many campers. The incident occurred in an encampment filled with hundreds of people participating in a bow-hunting event, Hampton said. \"We manage wild bears for a healthy and thriving population,\" said Dan Prenzlow, regional manager for wildlife with Colorado Parks and Wildlife. \"But when an individual bear enters a tent and attacks a sleeping person, we manage that animal to protect the public safety.\" The bear entered a tent occupied by a teenage boy and at least one other person early Friday. It bit the boy on the leg, but the teen fought it off.  The bear was then chased away by the teen and other campers at the site. Wildlife officials who responded to the scene determined that the black bear had been poking around the campsite before it attacked the teenage boy.  Investigators said they found a ransacked cooler and evidence that food had been eaten before the bear entered the tent. The teenager was taken to a hospital in nearby Leadville, Colorado, Hampton said.  He was treated for deep lacerations on one of his legs and released.  He is expected to recover but will receive followup treatment. Hampton estimated that there are around 12,000 black bears on Colorado's 23 million acres of public land.  There are no known brown bears or grizzlies in the state. Earlier this month, a man was killed in a grizzly bear attack in Wyoming's Yellowstone Park.  But park officials said the man, who was hiking with his wife, surprised the female grizzly while she was with her cubs.  They determined that she was acting defensively and decided not to put the bear down. CNN's Nigel Walwyn contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- Federal inspectors overseeing oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico accepted meals and tickets to sporting events from companies they monitored, the Interior Department's inspector general concluded in a report released Wednesday. In one case, an inspector in the Minerals Management Service office in Lake Charles, Louisiana, conducted inspections of four offshore platforms while negotiating a job with the company, the report states. Others let oil and gas company workers fill out their inspection forms in pencil, with the inspectors writing over those entries in ink before turning them in. Some in the same office accepted tickets to the 2005 Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl, a college football bowl game in Atlanta, Georgia. One inspector told an office clerk, \"Everyone has gotten some sort of gift before at some point\" from companies they regulated, according to the report. Investigators from the inspector general's office, the Interior Department's independent watchdog agency, took their findings to federal prosecutors in Louisiana, the report states. But the U.S. attorney's office in Lake Charles declined to bring charges, according to the report. Full coverage of the Gulf oil spill . \"Through numerous interviews, we found a culture where the acceptance of gifts from oil and gas companies were widespread throughout that office,\" the report states. However, that culture waned after a supervisor in the agency's New Orleans, Louisiana, regional office was fired for taking a gift from a regulated company in 2007, the report found. The period covered in the report is well before the April explosion that sank the oil rig Deepwater Horizon, resulting in a massive oil spill that well owner BP and federal authorities are trying to cap a month later. But Mary Kendall, the Interior Department's acting inspector general, said she pushed for the report's early release in the wake of the disaster. \"Of greatest concern to me is the environment in which these inspectors operate -- particularly the ease with which they move between industry and government,\" Kendall wrote in a letter to Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. Many of the inspectors joined MMS from the industry and had relationships with people in the business that originated \"well before they took their jobs with industry or government.\" Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said the report showed the agency's safety enforcement procedures need an extensive overhaul. \"They're supposed to be the cops on the beat, and instead they're out tailgating at sports events with people they're supposed to be policing,\" said Wyden, who leads a Senate Environment subcommittee on public lands. \"That's just not acceptable.\" The Lake Charles investigation was launched shortly after another scandal emerged from within the MMS. A September 2008 inspector general's report found regulators in the agency's Colorado office received improper gifts from energy industry representatives and engaged in illegal drug use and inappropriate sexual relations with them. Salazar, who has ordered a widespread shake-up of the agency since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, called Tuesday's report \"yet another reason to clean house.\" \"This deeply disturbing report is further evidence of the cozy relationship between some elements of MMS and the oil and gas industry,\" Salazar said in a statement on the report. He pledged to follow through with the inspector general's recommendations, \"including taking any and all appropriate personnel actions including termination, discipline and referrals of any wrongdoing for criminal prosecution.\" While the report predates the Deepwater Horizon spill, Salazar said he has asked Kendall to investigate whether inspectors failed to enforce standards aboard the rig. Its sinking left 11 men lost at sea and oil spilling into the Gulf. Kendall is scheduled to appear before the House Natural Resources Committee on Wednesday. Wyden said Salazar \"is heading in the right direction\" by reorganizing the agency, but he said MMS needs a bigger shakeup. \"Secretary Salazar has moved, in my view, as it relates to royalty payments and financial irregularities,\" he said. \"Now he has got to come down with hobnail boots on some of these ethical violations, and drain the safety swamp.\" MMS collected nearly $10 billion in royalties from the energy and mining industries in 2009. Salazar announced last week that he was splitting up the agency to separate its energy development, enforcement and revenue collection divisions, saying they have conflicting missions. The associate director for the agency's Offshore Minerals Management Program is leaving at the end of May, a month earlier than planned, in the wake of the Gulf spill. That official, Chris Oynes, launched the investigation that resulted in former New Orleans, Louisiana, supervisor Donald Howard's firing in 2007. Howard later pleaded guilty after being accused of failing to report gifts from an offshore drilling contractor valued at more than $6,600, according to the report. Danielle Brian, executive director of the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight, said earlier this month that the agency has been lax about collecting royalties from an industry it sees as \"a partner, a client.\" She pointed out that Randall Luthi, its previous director, left at the end of the Bush administration to become president of the National Ocean Industries Association, the trade association that represents offshore drillers. \"That really gives you a picture of the people who have been running the shop here,\" Brian said.

    "input": "(CNN) -- They are four American friends and seasoned travelers who were hiking through Iraq's Kurdistan region before three of them crossed the unmarked border with Iran, where they were detained by Iranian authorities. Ahmed Awa, on the border of Iraq and Iran, is where police saw and warned the American hikers Friday. Kurdish officials identified the detained hikers as Shane Bauer, Sarah Shourd and Joshua Fattal, CNN confirmed Sunday. The fourth hiker, Shon Meckfessel, stayed behind in Iraq. \"My husband and I are eager for the best welfare and conditions for our son, Josh, and for the other two companions he's with,\" Laura Fattal of Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, told CNN Radio. \"And that is our only concern, his welfare and the best conditions for him.\" Meckfessel was identified by his grandmother, who told CNN that he stayed behind because he felt sick. Meckfessel is at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. \"My grandson has asked me not to talk to the media,\" said the grandmother, Irene Meckfessel of Carmichael, California, before hanging up Saturday. Iran's state-run media reported that Iranian security forces arrested the three Americans Friday for illegally entering the country from Iraq's Kurdistan region and that the matter is under investigation. U.S. State Department officials say the Swiss ambassador to Tehran is seeking information about the case on behalf of Washington. The United States and Iran do not have diplomatic relations and Switzerland represents U.S. diplomatic interests in Iran. Friends of the travelers told CNN that the three who were detained have spent time or have lived in Western Europe and the Middle East. Sandy Close, executive director of the nonprofit Pacific News Service, described Bauer -- a photographer whose material was occasionally posted on her Web site in the past -- as a \"gifted linguist and photographer with wanderlust for travel and a student of Arab cultures. He's a remarkably talented guy.\" Shourd described herself as a \"teacher-activist-writer from California currently based in the Middle East\" on a profile listed on a travel Web site. Fattal shared his friends' love of travel and learning, and was described as \"fiercely intellectual\" by his friend, Chris Foraker, who spoke to CNN affiliate KVAL in Eugene, Oregon. Foraker said he met Fattal during a study abroad program in 2003, and the two worked together at the Aprovecho sustainable living research center in Cottage Grove. The four travelers spent the night at the Nirwan Hotel in Sulaimaniya on Thursday, said Mudhafer Mohammed, the owner of the hotel. Bauer, Shourd and Fattal left early Friday in a taxi for Ahmed Awa, a Kurdish town near Iraq's border with Iran, planning to hike in the mountains there, according to Peshrow Ahmed, spokesman for the security manager of Sulaimaniya. Ahmed Awa police spotted the hikers at one point Friday, Ahmed said, and warned them that they were near the border with Iran -- which is not marked in the area -- and that they should be careful. The group was in contact with Meckfessel in Sulaimaniya until about 1:30 p.m. Friday, when they reported they were \"surrounded by Iranian soldiers,\" Ahmed said. No further communication was received. Mohammed, of the Nirwan Hotel, told CNN that the hikers said they had come to the area because they heard it was safe, saying they were considering a trip to Ahmed Awa. But, he said, he advised them against it. \"I warned them many times,\" Mohammed told CNN. \"When they told me that they are planning to go to Ahmed Awa, I told them, 'Don't go there because it is unsafe for you because you're American and Ahmed Awa is very close to the Iranian border,'\" he said. Meckfessel left the hotel about 4:30 p.m., Mohammed said, asking him to take care of their luggage and saying he would not return. Later, he said, Sulaimaniya security forces took the luggage from the hotel. CNN's Arwa Damon and Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- South Sudan, the newest country in the world, is already facing a crisis. With more than 170,000 refugees on its northern border, and hundreds of thousands of people who have returned since independence, the newborn country is struggling. In July, the U.N. Refugee Agency accompanied South Sudanese supermodel Alek Wek to her native country during the one-year anniversary of its independence. Wek, a refugee herself, has used her celebrity status to raise awareness about refugee issues for more than a decade; last year a partnership between her and UNHCR began to gel. \"I went home for the independence with an open mind and to see how the returnees and refugees were doing,\" Wek said. In spite of the jubilee and pride that punctuated the independence festivities, the refugee situation is going from bad to worse. UNHCR is the lead agency managing seven camps on the contentious border between the north and the south. Torrential rains and complicated terrain are becoming lethal forces for the aid agency as it works to stave off an increasingly alarming situation. At the Yusuf Batil camp in Maban County, where Wek visited last month, 15% of the children are being rushed into acute malnutrition programs. In Upper Nile, nearly half the refugees are children under 11, and this group is suffering the most. After talking with refugees who had recently arrived in the camp, Wek said, \"I can't believe it's been 20 years and people are still fleeing violence.\" Wek participated in handing out soap and mosquito nets as part of a widespread health and sanitation program. In spite of these efforts, the camp is seizing from the impact of diseases such as malaria and diarrhea. At a mobile health clinic, many people show signs of malaria, including aid workers. \"I am so impressed by UNHCR staff who live and work side by side with the refugees,\" Wek said. \"It's really remarkable.\" All is not bleak though. Wek visited her hometown, Wau, where dozens of children greeted her before she went to see a new returnee village. UNHCR is assisting more than 330,000 South Sudanese who returned home from Khartoum, Sudan, and neighboring countries. \"This step in the process is exciting because it's the end of a long struggle,\" said Vincent Cochetel, the U.S. representative for UNHCR. \"What we work so hard for is for people to be able to go home.\" While talking with a mother who was sharing her joy over finally coming home, Wek also learned that programs to help people restart their lives are at risk of being cut because of competing needs in the country. \"I was told that 100 more houses and a school program had to be cut because of the expense of the crisis on the border. I think we as the international community have a social responsibility to help,\" she said. The UNHCR's Sudan refugee emergency appeal of $219 million is only 34% met. Concerned about the funding gap, citizens are stepping up to help. Pierre Omidyar, who founded eBay, and his wife, Pam, made a donation of $500,000, with the hope their contribution spurs more. But even a little goes a long way. A container to transport clean water can literally save a life and just $20 can provide 10 jerrycans for refugees. Similarly, $55 can buy five mosquito nets to protect children from the deadly threat of malaria. For $100, donors can provide kitchen sets for five families, and $345 will provide a family with much needed shelter. Wek plans to work with UNHCR not only on generating awareness for the emergency but also by helping the agency generate funds to support the returnees and their access to education. \"Education is the key to the future. South Sudanese people are rich like the soil; they just need a little water and they will grow,\" the beaming supermodel said. UNHCR is the lead agency on the frontlines of three raging emergencies. With the situations in Syria, Sudan/South Sudan and Mali continuing to worsen, the organization is facing challenges in staffing and funding. In the past six months, the agency has assisted more than 800,000 people who have been forced to escape deadly conflict. The agency is working around the clock to ensure families are safe and receive shelter, water, food and health care. To help South Sudan, go to UNrefugees.org/Alek.",

Gaza's gross domestic product was slashed by 85 percent during the 22 days of war, and it could take a year for the economy to recover, the agency said in a preliminary report. About 80 percent of crops in Gaza were destroyed, according to the agency. \"The pervasive sense here among the population is one of overwhelming grief, so many families have been destroyed in so many ways,\" said John Ging, the top United Nations official in Gaza. Ging, UNRWA's Gaza director of operations, said the bill could reach \"billions of dollars.\" Among the dead were 159 children, two of whom died in an UNRWA school that was shelled Saturday, Ging said. Gaza's main border crossings, which Israel often closed in response to Hamas rocket attacks, were open Monday. Infrastructure repairs were being made, but 400,000 people still had no water, according to Ging. Streets in some northern Gaza towns were flooded with sewage, and about 50 U.N. facilities were damaged, he said. More than 170 supply trucks crossed into Gaza on Monday, less than a third of the daily number that crossed in 2005, said John Holmes, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator. Israel tried to avoid civilian casualties in Gaza, a senior Israel Defense Forces officer said in a posting Monday on the IDF Web site. \"This was not a war against the Palestinians,\" he said. \"It was an operation of self-defense against Hamas and related terror organizations. Unfortunately, this task was made extremely difficult by Hamas, as they made the choice to use civilians as human shields.\" Israel began the offensive in response to rocket fire by Hamas militants after showing eight years of restraint, the officer said. The operation's goal, he said, \"was to improve the security situation in southern Israel, and to facilitate peaceful living for the Israeli civilians living there.\" \"We asked ourselves how to accomplish this, and the answer was to hit Hamas hard -- to strike the tunnels, the terrorists themselves, and all of their assets -- in order to prevent them from committing war crimes by firing rockets that target our civilian population,\" the officer said. He said seven rockets have been fired from Gaza into Israel since Sunday's cease-fire declaration. \"We want to give this cease-fire a chance, but if Hamas chooses not to, we will utilize all of our means,\" he said.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Drew Peterson has met with a prominent divorce attorney more than a year after his wife, Stacy, disappeared, his lawyer confirmed to CNN on Tuesday. Drew Peterson's behavior after his wife disappeared deepened suspicion, but he says she ran off. Peterson, a former Bolingbrook, Illinois, police sergeant, has not filed divorce papers, said his attorney, Joel Brodsky. But Peterson told an author he would look into a divorce after Stacy had been missing for a year. He said he was considering divorce for the sake of their children. \"I can confirm that Drew Peterson did have a consultation with Jeffrey Leving,\" Brodsky said, adding that no divorce papers have been filed. Leving, who bills himself as a father's rights lawyer, represented Cuban immigrant Elian Gonzalez's uncle and ultimately helped reunite the boy with his father. Police have said that 54-year old Peterson is a suspect in his wife's disappearance, which investigators have labeled a \"potential homicide.\" Peterson maintains that his wife, who was 23 at the time of her disappearance, left him for someone else. In an interview in May with Derek Armstrong, author of \"Drew Peterson Exposed,\" Peterson hinted that he planned to divorce her after she had been missing for a year. In Illinois, willful desertion or abandonment is grounds for a divorce after a year. The interview begins with Peterson expressing frustration with the media attention and negative reactions from his neighbors. \"We were talking about the neighbors and how it's hard to live in the neighborhood with the media trucks around and the neighbors being so difficult,\" Armstrong told CNN. \"I asked if he was going to move, and he said, 'Yeah, when I get a chance, but Stacy's on the title.' \" After the one-year anniversary of Stacy Peterson's disappearance passed, Armstrong said he began to make some phone calls to see whether Drew Peterson was acting on his earlier plans. Armstrong said he called two other prominent divorce lawyers until he reached Leving's office, which confirmed the meeting. In a phone conversation, Peterson confirmed to Armstrong that he was \"getting information\" and \"exploring options.\" Armstrong pressed Peterson, who responded, \"A desertion. She deserted me.\" Peterson elaborated, \"I've always said that I'm mad about that. But I'm looking into this for the kids. This neighborhood is not healthy for my kids because of Sharon Bychowski.\" Bychowski has been battling Peterson since his wife -- her friend and neighbor -- disappeared in October 2007. Peterson has accused Bychowski and other neighbors of harassing and threatening him. Armstrong asked Peterson whether he thought news of the divorce might encourage Stacy to contact him. \"I have nothing more to say,\" the former cop shot back. Brodsky told CNN he had not been aware that news of the meeting with the divorce lawyer had become public knowledge. \"We definitely didn't advertise it,\" he said. \"That's real thorough detective work. [Armstrong] could show police a thing or two about finding someone.\" Drew Peterson said he awoke at his suburban Chicago home to find his wife gone October 28, 2007. He said she called him at 9 p.m. and announced that she was leaving him, Peterson said. Police confirm that there was some activity on Stacy Peterson's cell phone about 9 p.m. October 28, but her family and close friends say she would never leave her two children behind or go away without mentioning it to her family. In the days leading up to her disappearance, Stacy Peterson confided in friends and her sister. She said she was afraid of her husband and wanted to leave him, according to her sister, Cassandra Cales. \"If anything happens to me, he killed me. It wasn't an accident,\" Cales quoted her as saying. At 10 a.m. that Sunday, Stacy Peterson failed to show up for an appointment with a friend. Worried, Cales called police Monday, October 29, and reported her sister missing. The media frenzy and police scrutiny soon revealed that Drew Peterson's third wife had died mysteriously a few years earlier during a nasty divorce. Kathleen Savio died just before the division of the marital assets was finalized, making Drew Peterson the sole beneficiary. Savio was found in the dry bathtub of her home. At the time, the death was ruled an accidental drowning. But her family continued to insist that Savio died as a result of foul play. The investigation into Stacy Peterson's disappearance brought renewed interest in Savio's death. Authorities exhumed Savio's body, further tests were conducted, and her death has now been ruled a \"homicide staged to look like an accident.\" Some witness statements portray Drew Peterson as jealous, possessive and controlling. He was said to keep such close track of his wife that he frequently called her cell phone and appeared unannounced at social outings to take her home. This caused tension in the marriage, the witnesses told police. Police named Drew Peterson as the prime suspect in his wife's disappearance in November 2007. He has not been charged in the case, but he has been charged with illegal gun possession, which could put him behind bars for up to five years if he is convicted.",

    "input": "San Diego, California (CNN) -- Marco Rubio is writing his life story. Now the only question is: Which life? The 40-year-old Florida senator, and Republican Party rock star, is shopping his memoir to New York publishing houses. There is sure to be a market; Republicans want to embrace a Latino conservative to shield them from accusations that their immigration rhetoric is anti-Latino, and so, for them, Rubio is the most beloved Latino since Desi Arnaz. A memoir is a good idea. Rubio may need a whole book to explain the contradictions surrounding his biography. Rubio has repeatedly said that his parents left Cuba after Fidel Castro took power in January 1959. But documents brought to light by the Washington Post and St. Petersburg Times reveal that Mario and Oriales Rubio arrived in the United States, legally on an immigration visa, much earlier -- in May 1956. So what? That's the scandal? Rubio is clearly not the only American with a bad memory. Many European-Americans are so far removed from their families' immigrant past that, not only can they not tell you when their ancestors migrated to the United States, sometimes they can barely tell you what country their family came from. \"Let's see, I'm part German, and I think I have a little Irish and some Italian. No, some French.\" Apparently, if you're Cuban-American, it matters a lot. There is a pecking order in South Florida. Being a descendant of those who came as political exiles after Castro came to power supposedly carries more cachet than if your family simply came as economic immigrants before Castro took power. I don't get it. But then, I'm not Cuban-American. So I defer to two friends (and media colleagues) who are. Alfredo Estrada, publisher of Latino Magazine, is skeptical about Rubio getting the dates wrong. \"When your parents left Cuba is seared into the memory of every Cuban-American,\" he told me. Rick Sanchez, whose family left Cuba in the winter of 1962, was much harder on Rubio. In an op-ed for The Huffington Post, the former CNN host blasted the inconsistency and tied it back to the senator's immigration views. \"[Rubio] convinced Americans that he was the son of political refugees,\" Sanchez wrote, \"implying that it somehow made him different from the other Hispanics who he attacks regularly -- the ones in Arizona, Georgia and Alabama that he and others want to detain, arrest and kick out. How dare they come here looking for work and to better their lot in life? Marco Rubio made us believe he is different from them when he's not.\" I understand what my friends are saying. And I understand that, as a Mexican-American and not a Cuban-American, there are some things I will never understand. Nevertheless, I thought that Rubio did a fine job of acquitting himself in an op-ed for Politico. \"The Washington Post accused me of seeking political advantage by embellishing the story of how my parents arrived in the United States,\" he wrote. \"That is an outrageous allegation that is not only incorrect, but an insult to the sacrifices my parents made to provide a better life for their children...I am the son of immigrants and exiles, raised by people who know all too well that you can lose your country. By people who know firsthand that America is a very special place...Ultimately what The Post writes is not that important to me. I am the son of exiles. I inherited two generations of unfulfilled dreams. This is a story that needs no embellishing.\" That's poetry, and yet that op-ed may have backfired. National Public Radio says that it has found discrepancies between what Rubio wrote for Politico and the account that Rubio offered on one of its shows two years ago. For Politico, Rubio wrote, \"In February 1961, my mother took my older siblings to Cuba with the intention of moving back... But after just a few weeks, it became clear that the change happening in Cuba was not for the better...So in late March 1961...my mother and siblings left Cuba and my family settled permanently in the United States.\" But, in 2009, Rubio told NPR's \"All Things Considered\" that his mother returned to Cuba in 1960 with his older siblings to care for her ailing father and that she wound up staying nine months because the Cuban government wouldn't let her and her eldest son, Mario, return to the United States. Eventually, she and her children were allowed to leave. Which is it? Did Rubio's mother return to Cuba in 1960 or 1961? Was she preparing to move back, or caring for a sick parent? And did she stay \"just a few weeks\" or nine months? Documents confirm that Oriales Rubio was in Cuba for just over one month. So the story that Rubio wrote in Politico was closer to the truth than the one he shared with NPR. Frankly, I don't know what to make of this story. My reporter's nose tells me there are more \"gotcha\" revelations to come. My head tells me that this whole story doesn't matter to most Americans. And my heart tells me that Rubio would not even be in hot water -- especially with fellow Latinos -- if he was not a Republican. Rubio is someone with a shot at becoming the first Latino in the White House, he terrifies the Democratic establishment. And so they want to take him out. Yet, I am quite impressed that the story of one family's exodus from Cuba more than 60 years ago has captured the attention of so many of my media colleagues. Now if I could just get them to focus on a much more important story to which many of them are turning a blind eye: the exodus of more than one million illegal immigrants from the United States, and the breaking up of hundreds of thousands of families, at the hands of the Obama administration. All of it for the sake of politics. Now that's what I call a scandal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.",

    "input": "LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Like all zombie movies, \"Zombieland\" has hundreds of zombies doing awful things, such as attacking and eating humans, but you could argue it's not a zombie movie. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson find themselves battling the undead in \"Zombieland.\" Zombie hordes do chase the main characters in a post-apocalyptic world, but the focus is on the comedy's stars, including two Oscar nominees -- Woody Harrelson and Abigail Breslin -- along with Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone. (Spoiler alert: A third Oscar nominee makes a remarkable cameo appearance, but this story will avoid spoiling the surprise by naming him.) \"We wanted to make a cool, kick-ass road movie about a dysfunctional family traveling across the country and zombies provide us the antagonists, the threat that our characters need to come together,\" said Paul Wernick, who wrote the screenplay with partner Rhett Reese. In fact, Wernick had only seen one zombie film before writing this script. Reese, who is a fan of the genre, kept the story on a track that would feed zombie fans' hunger for blood-and-guts action. \"[The] zombie genre is so well traveled, there is really no reason to get into it unless we could do it in a fresh, different way,\" Reese said. \"We were almost forced to think outside the box to make it an entertaining zombie movie.\" \"Zombieland\" is set in the United States months after a fast-moving virus begins turning most people into flesh-eating zombies. A handful of survivors come together to fight back. Wernick and Reese literally rewrote the rules for zombie films in this movie. Eisenberg's character is an obsessive-compulsive man who developed 47 rules -- such as \"fasten your seat belt\" -- designed to help him survive in Zombieland. While Eisenberg journeys to find his parents, he joins Harrelson, a zombie killer who is searching for the last Hostess Twinkie before its expiration date. Stone and Breslin play sisters who survive on their con artist skills. Their goal is to reach a California amusement park, which they think could be free of zombies. The cross-country trip these four characters share resembles \"National Lampoon's Vacation\" -- if written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.  Watch the stars of the film talk about zombie fans Â» . Wernick said they wanted to be \"very freewheeling.\" The movie \"gives the audience the thrill of the journey,\" he said. \"We wanted to take some wild turns.\" \"The rules that we lived by when writing this is in fact that there are no rules,\" he said. \"Zombieland\" may be to zombies what Tarantino's \"Inglourious Basterds\" is to Nazis. Wernick and Reese, who have been close friends since high school, often finish each other's sentences as if they were an old married couple. \"When we were trying to get 'Zombieland' off the ground back in the early days, we ...\" Wernick said. \"... assaulted Tarantino at an awards show, to try to get him to read the script,\" Reese said. \"That didn't work out,\" Wernick said in conclusion to their joint thought. \"He thought we were zombies coming after him.\" \"Zombieland,\" directed by Rubin Fleischer, offers many of the same elements as a Tarantino film. \"[Tarantino] is all about dialogue, character, irreverence, pop culture and we love all those things over the years,\" Reese said. \"We have always been inspired by him.\" The writers had to run through a number of actors before finding the person for the 10-minute cameo. Among them was Patrick Swayze, the writers' first choice. Swayze, who died just two weeks before the movie's release, turned down the role because of ill health earlier this year. Also asked: Joe Pesci, Steven Seagal, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Matthew McConaughey, Mark Hamill, Kevin Bacon and Sylvester Stallone. They were asked, but either didn't want the role or were not available, according to Wernick and Reese. With just a few days before filming the scenes, they asked Harrelson to look in his cell phone for names and numbers. He came up with a man who's been an Oscar nominee and Emmy winner. And now, he's got a key role in a zombie film.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- \"The LHC is back,\" the European Organization for Nuclear Research announced triumphantly Friday, as the world's largest particle accelerator resumed operation more than a year after an electrical failure shut it down. Restarting the Large Hadron Collider -- the $10 billion research tool's full name -- has been \"a herculean effort,\" CERN's director for accelerators, Steve Myers, said in a statement announcing the success. Update: First collisions at the LHC on Monday . Experiments at the LHC may help answer fundamental questions such as why Albert Einstein's theory of relativity -- which describes the world on a large scale -- doesn't jibe with quantum mechanics, which deals with matter far too small to see. Physicists established a circulating proton beam in the LHC's 17-mile tunnel at 10 p.m. (4 p.m. ET) Friday, CERN said, a critical step towards getting results from the accelerator. \"It's great to see beam circulating in the LHC again,\" said CERN Director General Rolf Heuer. \"We've still got some way to go before physics can begin, but with this milestone we're well on the way.\" Located underground on the border of Switzerland and France, the LHC has been inching towards operation since the summer. It reached its operating temperature -- 271 degrees below zero Celsius -- on October 8 and particles were injected on October 23. Now that a beam is circulating, the next step is low-energy collisions, which should begin in about a week, CERN said. High-energy collisions will follow next year. The collider has been dogged by problems. It made headlines early this month when a bird apparently dropped a \"bit of baguette\" into the accelerator, making the machine shut down. The incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut, said spokeswoman Katie Yurkewicz. Had the machine been going, there would have been no damage, but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures, she said. The collider achieved its first full-circle beam last year on September 10 amid much celebration. But just nine days later, the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine, Myers said. The faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two-thirds of an inch by two-thirds of an inch. \"There was certainly frustration and almost sorrow when we had the accident,\" he said. Now, \"people are feeling a lot better because we know we've done so much work in the last year.\" Mark Wise, professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology, said he's just as excited about the results that will come out of the LHC as he was last year and views the September 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event. Wise noted that Tevatron, the collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois, has also had its share of failures but is generally considered to work just fine. \"It's a horribly complicated piece of equipment, it's not like there's not going to be problems along the way,\" he said. \"They will surmount those problems.\" The LHC will probably be in operation more than 20 years, Myers said. But it won't be that long before scientists could potentially discover new properties of nature. The as-yet theoretical Higgs boson, also called \"the God particle\" in popular parlance, could emerge within two or three years, Myers said. Evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a \"super partner\" with similar properties in a quantum dimension (according to some physics theories, there are hidden dimensions in the universe) -- could crop up as early as 2010. For some theoretical physicists such as Wise, finding the Higgs boson and verifying every prediction of the Standard Model of physics would be the worst outcome. He wants the LHC to deliver surprises, even if that means no Higgs. \"When push comes to shove, the name of the game is 'what is nature,' and we're not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us,\" Wise said. ATLAS and CMS are the general-purpose experiments designed to find the Higgs boson and other rare particles that have never been detected before. ALICE, another experiment, will explore the matter that existed some 10 microseconds after the Big Bang, said John Harris, professor of physics at Yale University and national coordinator of ALICE-USA. At that time, there was a \"hot soup\" of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero, he said. Although they have never been directly seen, these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons, neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it. CNN's Elizabeth Landau contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A tornado almost a mile wide tore through Mississippi on Saturday, killing at least 10 people and causing significant injuries and damage as it raked cities from the central western border with Louisiana northeastward to Alabama. Two of the dead were children and one was a 3-month-old baby, according to Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) spokesman Jeff Rent. The death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews reach hard-hit areas where structures have been badly damaged, said another MEMA spokesman, Greg Flynn. Five of the dead were from Choctaw County, in the north central part of of the state, four were from Yazoo County, north of Jackson, and one was from Holmes County, also in the north central Mississippi, he said. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who was in Yazoo City where his home is located, called the twister \"gigantic\" and said that \"in places [it] seemed to be to be several miles wide.\" Some residents were trapped in badly damaged homes, he said. \"They're working to get to the people and rescue as many as they can,\" said Dan Turner, a spokesman for the governor, reporting \"significant injuries\" in at least three counties. Residents from the region shared tales of tragedy and survival on Saturday evening. Dale Thrasher was inside Yazoo City's Hillcrest Baptist Church when it was flattened by the tornado. \"I went in the sanctuary and got under the pulpit table and the whole building fell around me,\" he said. His injuries: \"three little scratches.\" Rob and Ashley Saxton were driving to a Yazoo City restaurant owned by Rob's father -- planning to take shelter in the restaurant's walk-in freezer ahead of the tornado -- when the twister blew out the car's windows at a red light. The car was tossed across the intersection, then picked up again and flung into the restaurant. \"When the windows exploded it wasn't like anything I've ever experienced,\" Rob Saxton said. \"It was amazing. It scared us plumb to death.\" Watch Gov. Barbour's update on storm damage in Yazoo City . In all, 12 counties were reporting injuries, with some of the injured airlifted to a Level 1 trauma center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said Jeff Rent, a MEMA spokesman. The hospital has 27 patients with injuries sustained in the tornado, including eight adults in critical condition and six children in serious condition, according to spokesman Jim Albritton. Many tornado victims were seeking attention at King's Daughters hospital in Yazoo City, where only one doctor was on duty Saturday night, said Jess Silvino, a nurse there. The hospital is expecting \"another one or two waves of victims\" as crews are able to fully access the tornado's path, said Richard Summers, chairman of emergency medicine at the medical center. The hospital has crews in Yazoo City and Lexington that have been \"amazed and astounded\" by the amount of damage they're seeing, Summers said. The state's emergency management officials have set up a command post near U.S. 49 in Yazoo City and the state has activated a 25-person rapid response team from Hattiesburg that is capable of search and rescue operations. my601.com: Local reports of damage, fatalities . The governor said he is activating local members of the National Guard in Yazoo City to maintain order. President Obama has \"been briefed on the tragedy in Mississippi and the situation is being followed by the White House,\" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said. Barbour said that he has not yet requested emergency federal aid but that he plans to do so on Monday. \"FEMA is in contact and coordination with our state and local partners and stand ready to help if a request is made,\" said Brad Carroll, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agancy. Mississippi residents reported that the path of the twister was a half-mile to a mile wide, said Mark McAllister, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Jackson. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the tornado had traveled 150 miles across Mississippi, starting in the western part of the state and moving northeast before weakening as it moved into Alabama. In Yazoo City, Fire Chief Roy Wilson said that between 20 to 30 houses were destroyed, and said some people were trapped inside structures. Wilson said he didn't yet have confirmed numbers on injuries. \"It's in pretty bad shape so far,\" he said of the city. Speaking to reporters in Yazoo City, Barbour said that 17 injured have been taken to a hospital via ambulance and that two others were airlifted to Jackson. \"By God's grace [the tornado] did not go into the most central part of the city, the most populous. However, it went through the southern edge and eastern edge of town in a number of large neighborhoods,\" he said. \"A number of businesses have been destroyed and others severely damaged -- there are churches that have been obliterated.\" The sheriff's department in nearby Hinds County is sending two dozen deputies and 100 inmates to assist with the response in Yazoo County and to clear debris, MEMA said. Have you been affected by severe weather? Send in pics, video . In Eagle Lake, near the Louisiana border, about 30 homes were destroyed, Turner said. In Holmes County, 50 homes sustained structural damage, the National Weather Service reported. Parts of three highways were closed due to downed trees and other damage: State Highway 3 in Yazoo County and State Highways 14 and 17 in Holmes County, according to the the Mississippi Department of Transportation. On I-55, traffic was down to a single lane in each direction in parts of Holmes County and in the area north of Pickens, the transportation department said. Linda Green, a dispatcher with the Issaquena County Sheriff's Department, said there was minimal damage in the area around Valley Park, and a few power lines were down. No injuries have been reported in Valley Park after the twister ripped through around 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET), she added. Valley Park is in Issaquena County, while Yazoo City is located in Yazoo County. Issaquena County is in the western part of the state, north of Vicksburg. Saturday's tornado was part of a broad band of storms that stretched from Missouri to the Florida Panhandle, Jeras said. The storm system struck Louisiana before it moved into Mississippi. A Tallulah, Louisiana, police dispatcher said a chemical plant in the city had been damaged, but could not give further details. Turner, the Mississippi governor's spokesman, said emergency response teams had been slowed by people out surveying the effects of the storm. \"One of the biggest obstacles is, of course, people are curious and want to get out and see the damage,\" he said. \"We've urged people to stay away from those areas, not only because it slows down the emergency response, but there are also still live electrical wires, there are open gas lines that will have to be shut down.\"",

A 40-vehicle convoy that seemed to be coming from the neighboring Dominican Republic headed into town Thursday afternoon on the Route Nationale in western Port-au-Prince. Escorted by heavily armed United Nations troops, the convoy had more than two dozen tractor-trailers, in addition to water and fuel tankers and even an armored car toward the back of the caravan. Some of the trucks carried the insignia of the Catholic Relief Services organization, while other vehicles bore markings identifying them as being from the Dominican Republic. Other aid and military vehicles traveled elsewhere in western Port-au-Prince, particularly on Boulevards T. L'Ouverture and 15 de Octobre. Residents as well as caregivers had complained earlier this week that aid was not getting out quickly enough. Full coverage | Twitter updates . For the second day in a row, the city gave indications of coming back to life. The sidewalks were crowded with street vendors and kiosks, and many small food stores were open. Dozens of stalls at a dusty market sold fruits and vegetables along a pocked and rut-filled dirt side street. A smaller market on a street corner saw some business. On the Route Nationale, residents crowded around the back of a parked brown semi-tractor trailer for hours before the back doors opened and local aid workers handed each person a six-pack of bottled water. The throng seemed relatively orderly, and no commotion was noticed. Long lines formed in front of some of the city's money-transfer offices, which opened for the first time since the January 12 quake that shattered large parts of Port-au-Prince. Haitians in line were there to pick up money sent to them from elsewhere, mainly the United States. iReport: List of missing, found | Are you there? Streets were choked with tap-taps, the brightly painted small pickup trucks that have been converted into passenger minibuses, with 10 or 12 people sitting on two facing benches on the truck bed. Many tap-taps carry Christian inspirations such as \"Jesus saves\" on their windshields and have intricate designs and messages on the side walls. Haitian police and U.N. military vehicles were common, and local authorities seemed to take an increased posture. Five national police officers, easily identified by their camouflage uniforms, jumped out of their truck at an intersection in the Cite de Soleil neighborhood near the harbor. They investigated men at the rear of two small pickups stopped there. One officer dropped to his right knee and briefly pointed his rifle toward the men. He and the other officers then abruptly turned around and walked away a few seconds later. Impact Your World . Cite de Soleil is the poorest and roughest neighborhood in the city, known more for its rampant crime and violence than its poetic-sounding name. Like all other parts of Port-au-Prince, many residents say it has fallen into increasing disrepair since the 1980s. A nearby neighborhood, Carrefour, was once a tourist destination but has become a run-down, lower-class neighborhood.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Governors in three Eastern Seaboard states Friday called on National Guard troops to help evacuate people from flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Ida. Strong winds and rain from the powerful storm have left thousands without power. Ida lost momentum but not the ability to generate winds and rain as it made landfall on the U.S. Gulf Coast earlier this week, forecasters said. The National Weather Service had flood advisories in effect Friday for areas of coastal Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey. At least 160 National Guard troops were deployed in sections of Virginia, Delaware and New Jersey to evacuate residents in high-water areas as well as provide cots, sandbags and potable water, according to the Pentagon's National Guard Bureau. \"About 40 members of the Delaware National Guard have provided support to civilian emergency relief agencies in Kent and Sussex counties,\" the bureau said. The New Jersey National Guard sent 18 guardsmen with trucks to help with evacuations in the Cape May and Atlantic counties, where the governor Thursday declared a state of emergency due to flooding, Guard officials reported . Almost 100 guardsmen with high-water vehicles were helping firefighters in Portsmouth, Virginia. Virginia Gov.

    "input": "Madrid (CNN) -- Spain's new government announced a series of spending cuts Friday intended to bring down the country's soaring deficit amid concerns over the European debt crisis. The conservative Popular Party, which was only sworn in last week, has said it will set out its full budget by March 2012 but urgent action is needed to reduce borrowing. Among the austerity measures ahead are a continued freeze on public sector salaries and hiring, as well as a freeze, for the first time, on the minimum wage, said Budget and Public Administration Minister Cristobal Montoro Romero after a Cabinet meeting Friday. The only public spending increase next year will be on pensions, which will rise by about 1%, he said. Pension payments were frozen under the Socialists, who led the previous government, amid much public outcry. Welfare payments for the unemployed will be maintained, Montoro said, while those earning the most will face higher taxes. Tough measures are needed for the next two years because the 2011 deficit is higher than expected, at 8% of Gross Domestic Product, Montoro said. GDP is the total market value of all the goods and services produced by a country in a given year. He said the government was asking for sacrifices from those who have more, rather than the ones who are already suffering. Prime Minister Rajoy, whose party won a landslide election victory over the Socialists last month, has said his top priority is pulling the nation out of its deep economic crisis. Investors have been closely watching yields on euro area government bonds this year for signs the debt crisis is spreading to larger economies such as Spain and Italy. The concern is that their governments may not be able to service their debts and fund their activities if borrowing costs hold above 7% for a sustained period. If that happened Spain and Italy might be the next eurozone nations to need a bailout. Yields on 10-year Spanish bonds hit a 6.7% high in November but have dropped back since. In a speech to Parliament after he was sworn in last week, Rajoy reiterated his campaign theme that fixing the broken economy, including boosting growth and job creation, would be his priority. About 5 million people in the country are jobless. Spain has an overall unemployment rate of 21.5%, but its youth unemployment rate is a staggering 45%. Rajoy said 16.5 billion euros (about $21.5 billion) would be cut from the budget next year to meet Spain's deficit reduction target, in measures yet to be spelled out in full. He said there would soon be labor market reforms to make Spain's workforce more flexible and competitive, and that there would be mergers and takeovers in Spain's troubled banking sector -- which holds a lot of bad debt from 750,000 unsold new homes that went up during the real estate boom but before the financial crisis and credit crunch set in.

    "input": "New York (CNN) -- As they worked to determine if new bones found off Long Island, New York, were human -- and possibly those of victims of a suspected serial killer believed to have targeted sex workers -- tests were underway Monday to match up identities with at least four other sets of discovered remains. Police have previously identified four victims found on Oak Beach in December 2010 as women who advertised prostitution services on websites such as Craigslist. Now, \"the DNA process is underway\" on at least five other sets of remains found in and around nearby beaches in the time since, New York City medical examiner's office spokeswoman Ellen Borakove said Monday. Investigators are trying to determine the identities of these victims, while looking for clues about their killer or killers and any link between all the deaths. The remains include a skull and bones found as recently as last week in Nassau County, as well as a bone fragment of unknown origin found by divers off the Oak Beach area last Friday. New York City's medical examiner office -- the largest non-profit DNA lab in the United States, according to Borakove -- is doing the analysis, and will then turn over the information to investigators in Suffolk and Nassau counties and the New York state police. Experts will extract DNA from the remains to create a profile, which can be used by investigators. \"We're going back to some of the unidentified people in our system to try to see if we can identify them, so we can notify loved ones if we have their remains,\" said Borakove. \"Hopefully ... we'll find out who these people are.\" Meanwhile, the search for more clues continued Monday. FBI agents flew a Blackhawk helicopter over area beaches using high-tech equipment to photograph areas that have been previously examined and searched from the ground. The flyovers were finished by Monday evening. New York State troopers and some 30 police officers from Long Island's Nassau and Suffolk counties hacked their way through the area's thick brush and bramble last week, using guidance from a helicopter overhead and, in some cases, using chainsaws to cut through the thick foliage. Aviation teams that flew over parts of Long Island had \"identified a significant number of items that aren't natural for the area,\" Nassau County Acting Police Commissioner Thomas Krumpter said last Thursday. Last week, police discovered skeletal remains -- including the human skull -- prompting the wider search. Police have not said whether the remains are from different people or if they could have come from the eight bodies found previously. Police have used canine search units to scour the beaches and diver teams to search the waterways on the north side of the barrier island. But they have met obstacles, such as thick brush that canine teams won't go in. On April 11, remains were found in a Nassau County wildlife preserve, a law enforcement official said. The remains were wrapped in a \"black plastic product\" similar to a plastic bag, a law enforcement source said. The remains \"appeared to be part of a lower extremity,\" the source said. Medical examiner investigators have been trying to determine the age and sex of the people whose remains were found, as well as how long they were at the locations before they were discovered. A lawyer for the mother of 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy, who police have identified as one of the victims, said that a man -- using the woman's cell phone -- made taunting phone calls and claimed to have killed the woman. The lawyer, Steve Cohen, said on one August 26, 2009, call, the man said, \"Do you think you'll ever see her again? You won't. I killed her.\" Police have not publicly identified any suspects in the case, nor offered a profile of the person or persons they believe may have been responsible for the multiple deaths.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Barack Obama's overseas trip has generated a lot more buzz than John McCain's foreign travels, but when it comes to popularity abroad, both candidates have their strengths. Sen. Barack Obama's trip to the Middle East and Europe has attracted heavy media attention. McCain is more of a familiar face among Europe's politicians. The senator from Arizona is better known because he's met with a lot of foreign leaders and has been active in conferences overseas, said Robin Niblett, a London, England-based international affairs analyst. But European lawmakers said McCain's experience could work against him because of the association with President Bush and the war in Iraq. Obama, on the other hand, is more of a fresh face abroad; the trip is his first since sewing up the Democratic nomination in June. It's his first visit to Afghanistan and first to Iraq in two years. In addition to Afghanistan and Iraq, Obama has passed through Kuwait since leaving the United States on Thursday. He's expected to visit Jordan and Israel before making a European swing through Germany, France and the United Kingdom. The novelty of Obama's trip increases the media attention because the storyline is more interesting, according to Michael Crowley, senior editor of The New Republic.  Watch: Is Obama's trip getting too much coverage? Â» . \"When McCain goes overseas, it's sort of 'dog bites man.' There's not really that much of an interesting angle to it,\" Crowley said Sunday on CNN's \"Reliable Sources.\" \"This is an incredible story, the first African-American nominee going abroad after a long period of anti-Americanism, promising a new start and a new direction for the country. There's so many fascinating angles, whereas McCain is sort of offering somewhat more of a continuation of what we already know.\" Although Obama is making his trip abroad as a senator from Illinois and not a presidential candidate, the tour is aimed at boosting his foreign policy credentials. His trip has produced several high-profile photo ops, including pictures of Obama with American troops and with leaders such as Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. All three of the major U.S. broadcast networks' anchors -- Katie Couric, Charlie Gibson and Brian Williams -- are set to cover Obama from overseas. \"What that means, of course, is that the 'CBS Evening News,' 'NBC Nightly News' and ABC's 'World News' will be broadcast from Europe and the Middle East this week, throwing an even brighter spotlight on Barack's [Obama's] excellent adventure,\" said Howard Kurtz, host of CNN's \"Reliable Sources.\" McCain, however, was met by zero anchors on his foreign trips since he became the presumptive Republican nominee, Kurtz pointed out. A recent poll from Britain's Guardian newspaper and ICM Research suggests that Obama is five times as popular as McCain there. Conducted this month, the poll indicates that 53 percent think Obama would make the better president, compared with 11 percent for McCain. The remaining 36 percent declined to express a preference. The survey, conducted July 9-10, questioned 1,009 adults and has a sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. Back in the United States, Obama leads McCain by a much smaller margin: 47 percent to 41 percent, according to CNN's latest \"poll of polls.\" The poll of polls includes five surveys: Gallup (July 12-14), CBS/The New York Times (July 7-14), ABC/The Washington Post (July 10-13), Quinnipiac (July 8-13) and Newsweek (July 9-10).

    "input": "(CNN) -- A 19-year-old American Muslim detained and questioned in Kuwait is suing the U.S. government, claiming it is refusing to let him fly home because he is on a \"no-fly\" list. Stuck in limbo between the country he calls home and the place he was visiting on what his lawyer describes as a journey of self-discovery, Gulet Mohamed of Alexandria, Virginia, has been trapped in Kuwait for nearly a month, according to a lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court in Virginia. \"No-fly\" lists were set up to protect Americans against potential threats. They are designed to prevent terrorist suspects from boarding planes to and from the United States. But Mohamed's lawyer, Gadeir Abbas, says in the lawsuit that the U.S. government is impeding his client's basic right to return and live freely in the United States.  Abbas is a staff attorney for the Counsel on American-Islamic Relations. At a hearing Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Alexandria, Virginia, Judge Anthony J. Trenga  told the government that it should make arrangements to allow Mohamed to return before the end of this week unless it could produce evidence against him. The lawsuit says Mohamed came to the United States from Somalia with his family when he was just 3 years old, grew up in Virginia and is now a naturalized citizen. In March of 2009, Mohamed's curiosity led him halfway around the world to visit relatives living overseas and to learn Arabic, according to the lawsuit. He started his journey in Sanaa, Yemen, but then moved to Somalia where he stayed with relatives for several months. By August he was on his way to Kuwait where an uncle took him in so he could continue his Arabic studies, the suit says. Mohamed followed proper travel procedures, according to the lawsuit, renewing his visitor's visa twice during his stay in Kuwait. But when he went to Kuwait's international airport last December to get another 90-day extension he waited several hours. The lawsuit says Mohamed wrote an e-mail to his brother in Virginia while he waited, saying the process was taking longer than usual. That was the last time anyone heard from him for a week, the suit says. According to the lawsuit, Mohamed says he was approached at the airport by two men who handcuffed and blindfolded him. They drove him to another location in an SUV. Mohamed claims he was beaten, tortured and interrogated over the next week. The lawsuit describes him being whipped, threatened with electrocution and questioned by captors who had private information about his family in the United States . They also questioned him about his relationship with Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born Muslim cleric who has close ties to al Qaeda and who is believed to be in Yemen. Mohamed's lawyer says he denies any link to  al-Awlaki. Mohamed was transferred to a deportation facility in Kuwait on December 28, the lawsuit says. He used a fellow detainee's hidden cell phone and was able to contact his family and retain a CAIR attorney. According to the lawsuit, Kuwaiti officials have told Mohamed's family they are holding him on behalf of the U.S. His lawyers say Kuwaiti officials have tried to deport Mohamed but were unable to do so because the United States had placed him on a \"no-fly\" list. A U.S. official confirmed to CNN that Mohamed is on a \"no-fly\" list, but would not explain why. Mohamed was visited twice by FBI agents while in detention, according to the suit. He claims the FBI agents physically intimidated him, threatened him with criminal charges and told him he would remain in detention indefinitely if he didn't speak to them. Mohamed refused to answer their questions without counsel, the lawsuit says. Mohamed's lawyers told CNN that at the suggestion of  Kuwaiti officials, his family recently bought a plane ticket for him to return to the United States. However, when the officials took him to the airport Sunday, he was not allowed onto the plane. Mohamad's lawyers contend that the information that his interrogators had -- and the questions he was asked -- indicate it was the U.S. government who had him held and questioned. U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley denied Mohamed was being detained at the behest of the United States. Crowley told CNN Tuesday that the State Department has provided Mohamed with consular access and is committed to him having fair treatment. Crowley said the department hasn't had access to Mohamed since December. CNN's Laurie Ure contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- A Michigan man and woman were convicted Thursday of trying to extort $680,000 from \"Full House\" actor John Stamos by threatening to sell compromising photos that prosecutors say were never found. Scott Edward Sippola, 31, and Allison Lenore Coss, 24, could face up to nine years in prison for convictions of conspiracy and interstate communications to extort money, said assistant U.S. Attorney Maarten Vermaat. Sentencing is set for October 8. \"The case was made by the fact that these defendants made threats to damage his [Stamos'] reputation in order to have him pay them,\" Vermaat said after the verdict in Marquette, Michigan. Jurors deliberated for about five hours Thursday. According to CNN affiliate WLUC,  prosecutors said that Coss and Sippola demanded $680,000 from the television actor or they would sell embarrassing pictures to tabloid publications of Stamos allegedly using drugs. Vermaat said the defendants sent about 40 e-mails to Stamos threatening to sell the photos. FBI agents got involved and started monitoring Stamos' e-mail account and \"eventually communicated by cellular telephone with the defendants pretending to be Mr. Stamos' business manager.\" Sippola and Coss were arrested in December 2009 at an airport, a pre-arranged drop off spot for the money. Defense attorney Sarah Henderson alleged at trial that Stamos had a fling with Coss when she was a 17-year-old vacationing on spring break in 2004. Prosecutors said Stamos met Coss during a trip to Disney World in Orlando, Florida. They developed a friendship and the two communicated by e-mail occasionally until November 2009, when the actor turned the photos matter over to the FBI. According to WLUC, Coss testified there were several photos depicting Stamos using cocaine. She claimed the actor seemed interested in buying the photos. The actor testified that nothing inappropriate happened at a 2004 spring-break party and, accordingly, he didn't believe compromising photos existed. Stamos said Thursday he wants to get back to work. \"I would like to thank the court, the FBI and the U.S .Attorney's office for their swift and efficient dealings in connection with this case,\" Stamos said in a statement Thursday afternoon. \"I am shocked and perplexed how individuals could fabricate so many false stories in an effort to defend a crime. I agreed to be a witness for a federal criminal prosecution and endured countless false accusations about my behavior and appropriateness. The allegations made regarding an inappropriate relationship are completely untrue. These slanderous allegations to smear my reputation were part of their defense to redirect attention away from the federal crime of extortion. There was no hot tub, no drugs, no nudity and nothing sexual in nature involved in my friendship with this woman. They lied about everything from a pregnancy to compromising photos.\" A call by CNN to defense attorney Sarah Henderson was not immediately returned.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The death toll from Pakistan's massive flooding has climbed to 1,639, but the number could rise substantially as flood waters recede and more bodies surface, government officials say. More than 17 million Pakistanis -- about the population of the Netherlands -- have been affected by the monsoon floods that began a month ago. In the past few days, at least 1 million people have been displaced in Pakistan's Sindh province, the United Nations said. Authorities issued evacuation orders after a levee burst. Want to help Pakistan? Impact Your World suggests how . Homeless families stomped through filthy waters as clean water remains a scarce commodity. Hundreds of thousands of victims have acquired transmittable ailments such as acute watery diarrhea, scabies and respiratory infections. The United Nations says more than $1 billion has been given or pledged. On Saturday, the United States announced the deployment of 18 additional helicopters to assist with relief efforts, according to the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, Pakistan. About 15 other U.S. helicopters and three other aircraft have transported 2 million pounds of supplies, the embassy said. But the need for help is greatly outpacing the supply. \"The magnitude of this crisis is reaching levels that are even beyond our initial fears, which were already leaning toward what we thought would be the worst,\" Maurizio Giuliano, a spokesman for the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said Friday. \"The number of those affected and those in need of assistance from us are bound to keep rising. The floods seem determined to outrun our response.\" The U.N. also said Friday that it is increasingly concerned about flood-driven malnutrition among children. \"The flooding has surrounded millions of children with contaminated water,\" said Karen Allen, deputy representative of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) in Pakistan. \"Most have nothing else to drink. We fear the deadly synergy of waterborne diseases, including diarrhea, dehydration and malnutrition.\" Acute malnutrition was high in much of Pakistan even before the floods. For instance, 27 percent of children under 5 in Baluchistan province were malnourished, as were 17 percent of children in Punjab, according to the U.N. A hospital in Sindh is overrun with people suffering from waterborne illness; two children share each bed and more are on the floor. A doctor at the hospital said there are \"not enough resources because of huge population ... coming to this hospital.\" Remat Chacher, a farmer in Sindh, escaped the flood waters with his wife and two children earlier this month. But then his 3-month-old daughter Benazir got sick. \"She started to get fever and couldn't keep anything down ... lots of belly pain,\" said Ulla, the infant's mom. A few days later, the same symptoms struck the Chachers' son, 2-year-old Wazira. Both children died on the way to the hospital, with Wazira weighing just 8 pounds and Benazir weighing 2 pounds. At least 200 health facilities across the country have been damaged or destroyed, according to the World Health Organization. Flood waters have started to recede across Pakistan, but in the Indus River delta, the potential for more flooding remained high. It is unclear when displaced Pakistanis will be able to return to their homes. But many will have no house to return to. About 1.2 million homes have been destroyed from the flooding.

The British Press Association cited an unnamed source saying Osbourne, 24, is being treated at the Hazelden retreat in Oregon. \"Kelly Osbourne has voluntarily entered a medical facility to address some personal issues,\" spokeswoman Caroline Barrett said in a statement e-mailed to CNN. \"Her family stands by and supports her.\" Osbourne was jailed in London in January on a charge of assaulting a British newspaper gossip columnist at a London nightclub last summer. She was freed on bail. She's been absent in recent weeks from a British radio talk show in which she dispenses life advice to young people. Her father, who rose to fame with the heavy metal group Black Sabbath, and mother Sharon revealed nearly five years ago that Kelly Osbourne entered the Promises rehab facility in Malibu, California, for treatment of a painkiller addiction. Their revelation came in an appearance on CNN's \"Larry King Live\" in May 2004. \"We just had to take evasive action very quickly, because the amount of pills that was found in her bag was astounding,\" Ozzy Osbourne told Larry King. Kelly Osbourne gained fame as a teenager when her family opened up their lives to cameras for an MTV reality show \"The Osbournes.\" She used the exposure to launch her own music career.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Capt. Tadeusz Wrona still has trouble sleeping. The night after executing a spectacular belly landing in Poland, the veteran pilot tossed and turned until 4 a.m. The phone kept ringing, he told Polish media, and he kept reliving the chilling moments when his crew and passengers came close to a disaster. Now basking in his nation's adoration and fielding countless interview requests, Wrona is resting even less, he said with a weary smile. Wrona, who has worked for LOT Polish Airlines for 20 years, was at the controls of a Boeing 767 en route from Newark, New Jersey, to Warsaw on Tuesday when he realized there was a problem with the landing gear. When the second attempt to open it failed, he knew that everyone on board -- 220 passengers and 11 crew -- was in danger. \"I've maybe flown this plane 500 times, and the landing gear deployed every time,\" Wrona said during a news conference in Warsaw on Wednesday. \"I never had any trouble flying Boeing.\" Aware of comparisons to the 2009 \"Miracle on the Hudson,\" when Capt. Chesley \"Sully\" Sullenberger landed a plane in New York's Hudson River after a flock of geese damaged both of the aircraft's engines, Wrona pointed out that his situation was less dire. Both of his engines were working fine and there was time to prepare. After notifying Warsaw's airport that there might be an emergency landing, the crew had time to perform checks and various functions, Wrona said. They circled the city to burn off excess fuel. While the crew reviewed the procedure in the cockpit, the flight attendants prepared the cabin, instructing passengers that they would have to evacuate as soon as the plane stopped on the ground. The autopilot helped the crew guide the plane until about two minutes before landing, Wrona said. That's when he took manual control. \"We rested the plane on three points: two engines plus the rear portion of the fuselage,\" Wrona said. \"We tried to do it delicately, and we were successful.\" There was less noise during the belly landing than a normal touch down, which shocked Wrona. It was just quiet, he recalled. Wrona, who has been dubbed the Polish version of Sullenberger, was praised by the original \"miracle\" pilot. \"The captain and the crew obviously did a great job,\" Sullenberger told CNN. \"It definitely requires skill to do this well, and from all reports and from watching the video, it looked like it was done very, very well.\" But for Wrona, there were still tense moments ahead. \"When the plane stopped on the runway, I wasn't sure whether everyone was safe, because smoke appeared,\" he recalled. (Wind had blown the smoke caused by the friction of the landing toward the cockpit.) \"I finally felt full relief only when the purser reported that the cabin was empty.\" Everyone got out safe and unhurt. Like Sullenberger, Wrona is now grappling with sudden fame and the gratitude of hundreds of families. He's a Facebook star, with several fan pages established in his honor. One page has more than 33,000 followers leaving messages of praise and adulation. But Wrona insists it's too much to call him a national hero. \"I am convinced that all of us who work for LOT would do the exact same thing, and it would end in the same way, because we train for such situations on simulators,\" he said. Wrona is fully prepared to return to his duties as pilot, he said. In fact, his schedule -- prepared before the incident -- has him flying to Hanoi, Vietnam, on Saturday. He's not sure whether the commission investigating the emergency landing will let him go. Wrona's wife and two adult children beamed when they were interviewed by Polish media on Thursday. Marzena Wrona found out about her husband's troubled flight on television while the plane was still circling Warsaw and raced to the airport to watch the emergency landing, she told the program DzieÃâ Dobry TVN. But she had to turn back when authorities closed off many streets leading to the airport as a safety precaution. When she got back home, the plane had already landed. \"I knew the landing would be successful because I couldn't imagine otherwise,\" Wrona's wife said.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- Reactions ranged from gloom-and-doom predictions to celebrations to ho-hum business-as-usual as the U.S. military changed its rules Tuesday to allow gay men and lesbians to serve openly. A minute into the new day, at 12:01 a.m., the old \"don't ask, don't tell\" rule that has been in force since the Clinton administration was gone. In its place was a policy designed to be blind to sexual orientation and one that the Pentagon brass insists will maintain the military in fighting trim, with no negative impact on \"military readiness, military effectiveness, unit cohesion and recruiting and retention.\" Defense Secretary Leon Panetta and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen told a news conference that the repeal enhanced the integrity of the nation's fighting forces. \"They'll all get up, they'll all go to work, and they'll all be able to do that work honestly, and their fellow citizens will be safe, and that's all that really matters,\" Mullen said. Some members of the U.S. military -- many who carefully hid both their identities and sexual orientation for years -- wasted no time in going public. That included the man who until now had been known as J.D. Smith. Smith had been at the forefront of pushing for the repeal, as co-founder and co-director of a group called OutServe, which bills itself as the Association of Actively Serving LGBT Military Personnel. As an active-duty service member, he would only speak to the media under a pseudonym. Under the new rules, his real identity can be revealed, and he announced at a news conference Tuesday that he is 1st Lt. Josh Seefried, an airman serving on a base in New Jersey. Until now, Seefried said, he had worried every day that he could lose his military career if it became known he was gay. \"Today and every day I can go back into work with that burden lifted off my shoulders and not have to worry about it any more,\" he said. Concerns of a possible hostile reaction from heterosexual colleagues were unfounded, Seefried said, adding that \"no one's going hurt us when we go back to our units.\" Others joined him. OutServe published a new edition Tuesday called the \"Repeal Issue.\" It was available on some military bases around the world and included photos of 101 active service members openly stating they are gay. The OutServe magazine is also distributed online. \"Now we are stepping forward, to a new day, a new life,\" wrote Air Force Staff Sgt. Jonathan Mills. \"A life of openness, integrity, of honor. At last, our country has accepted us -- not for who we love or how we love but who we are.\" The magazine said its photo essay on 101 people serving in the military represented just a portion of the approximately 70,000 \"currently serving\" lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender military personnel. \"Today, for the first time in our history, we will welcome the service of any qualified individual who's willing to put on the uniform of our country,\" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican credited with corralling support for the repeal. Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, called it \"a day to celebrate that it does get better, and we are moving toward a more perfect union.\" Seefried wrote a book on his experiences titled \"Our Time: Breaking the Silence of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell.\" It had been advertised under his cover identify, but now Amazon is ready to substitute his real name on the book, he said. \"The book is really important to me because this ties into people finding out that there are other gay military members out there serving,\" Seefried earlier told CNN. \"I remember a book I read when I was in college done by a gay military officer and it gave me courage and I hope this book does the same.\" He admitted a lot of people will be surprised, including friends and co-workers of his, as well as many thousands of other military personnel who may learn something new about their battle buddies or colleagues. \"People will be shocked, but at least they are going to be talking about it,\" Seefried said. \"And talking can bring down barriers.\" One of the most vocal and active proponents of the change, Alex Nicholson of Servicemembers United, was discharged from the Army in 2002 under the old policy. \"I think it is a combination of thoughts and feelings,\" Nicholson said in a telephone interview. \"It's going to be vindication for people discharged. Also there is a sense of relief.\" He looks back at the speeches he gave around the country, sometimes in the face of such opposition that he required police protection, and to the political bargaining sessions. \"I feel very fortunate to have been one of those in the rooms on Capitol Hill and in the White House and with senior administration staff,\" Nicholson said. Congress finally voted in the repeal of the law last December and President Barack Obama signed the legislation just before Christmas. Panetta said Tuesday that more than 97% of the nation's 2.3 million uniformed service personnel had been trained for the end of \"don't ask, don't tell.\" One of the most prominent congressional supporters of the change, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, said that from now on, thousands of Americans will be able to serve their country without concealing part of their identity. \"They will no longer have to lie in order to help protect us,\" Levin said in a statement released by his staff. \"The end of 'don't ask, don't tell' is an important victory not just for equality, but integrity.\" But a longtime opponent of the change, Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness, said she was concerned that allowing gays and lesbians to serve would drive many loyal troops out of the military. \"Due to the president's political promises, the military faces heavy burdens of confusion and tension that could have been avoided,\" Donnelly said. \"This is nothing for the administration to be proud of.\" She said it may be years before the damage to the military is apparent, as some people delay their departure because of a weak economy. It would not be wise to consider recruiting, retention and morale to be assured indefinitely, Donnelly said. Servicemembers United said today that 14,346 people were discharged under the \"don't ask, don't tell\" policy. Some of the people who were forced out under the old policy are now reapplying, as the new rules reopen a door that had been shut. Michael Almy was an Air Force officer for 13 years and helped control the air space over Iraq during some of the fiercest fighting of the war. He left in 2006. \"My hope is to get back in. I've talked to recruiters. I'm starting to look at that process,\" Almy said. He says that nothing is going to repair the damage to his career, after a five-year gap. \"I'm hoping that I can at least get back in there where I left off and resume my career -- hopefully, just be a role model,\" Almy said. \"Because that's what we need right now; we need gay and lesbian role models, officers and enlisted alike, who can serve honestly and openly next to their straight counterparts and show no detriment to the mission whatsoever.\" Servicemembers United's Nicholson predicts smooth sailing for all sides in the coming weeks and months. \"I think the real story is going to be the non-story,\" Nicholson said. \"What this is going to do is normalize everything that is already there.\" CNN's Tom Cohen contributed to this report.",

    "input": "TEHRAN, Iran (CNN)  -- Iran announced Wednesday that it successfully tested another \"Sajil\" missile, a surface-to-surface missile with a range that makes it capable of reaching parts of Europe. Image purportedly shows the test launch of Iran's new Sajil surface-to-surface missile. A similar test was carried out in November. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said he understood Wednesday's test of the missile, with an approximate range of 1,200 miles, was successful. State media reported that the missile, a Sajil-2, was launched Wednesday morning from the northern Iranian city of Semnan and reached its target. The report did not say where it landed. The missile was test-fired successfully, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told a group of residents in Semnan province, state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Ahmadinejad said the missile \"met the predetermined target,\" according to the news agency. Gates said he could not confirm that it had hit the intended target. A White House official said the test is noteworthy. \"I think it is a significant technical development,\" said Gary Samore, special assistant to the president on nonproliferation, in a Washington speech Wednesday. \"Of course, this is just a test, and obviously there is much work to be done before it can be built and deployed. But I see it as a significant step forward in terms of Iran's capacity to deliver weapons,\" Samore said. \"And I think it actually helps us in terms of making a case to countries like Russia, which were skeptical in the past whether Iran actually poses a threat. This is a very clear demonstration that Iran is moving in the direction of longer-range missiles.\" An Israeli official, meanwhile, said the test should be more of a concern to Europe than to Israel, since previous missiles tested by Iran could already reach the Jewish state. \"If anyone had any doubt, it is now clear that the Iranians are playing with fire,\" Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said Wednesday in an interview on Kol Israel Radio. \"We know that the Iranians are developing capabilities of thousands of kilometers, that could reach the coasts of the United States.\" \"The Iranian clock is ticking fast and it must be stopped,\" Ayalon said. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said President Obama \"expressed ... his great concern, his continued concern, about Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons capability and nuclear weapons technology.\" The Sajil is a new generation of surface-to-surface Iranian-made missiles that \"demonstrates a significant leap in Iran's missile capabilities,\" Uzi Rubin, the former director of Israel's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, told Jane's Information Group after the November test. \"Regardless of the success of the test, this missile places Iran in the realm of multiple-stage missiles, which means that they are on the way to having intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities,\" he said. Sajil missiles are powered by solid fuel, which uses smaller containers and helps the rockets travel longer distances, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad told the semiofficial Fars News Agency. Iran says the missiles have a range of almost 2,000 kilometers (1,243 miles). If that is true, the missile brings Moscow, Russia, Athens, Greece, and southern Italy within striking distance from Iran, according to Jane's, which provides information on defense issues. Gates said the missile was probably \"on the low end of that range.\" After the November launch, the United States restated its objection to such tests, saying they violate Iran's obligations under United Nations Security Council resolutions. U.S. officials have cast doubt on the success of past missile test launches by Iran, including a rocket launch in August and a series of missile tests in July. Wednesday's reported test comes after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. officials in Washington to discuss how to deal with the potential of a nuclear-armed Iran. He met Tuesday with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader John Boehner. Obama, who met with Netanyahu on Monday, stuck by his refusal to commit to an \"artificial deadline\" for Iranian negotiations on its nuclear program. But he also warned that he would not allow such talks, which he expects to accelerate after the Iranian presidential election in June, to be used as an excuse for delay. He said the United States is not \"foreclosing a range of steps, including much stronger international sanctions, in assuring that Iran understands that we are serious.\" Netanyahu wanted a time limit for negotiations relating to such ambitions, with the threat of military action if no resolution is reached. Asked if the missile launch will dampen Obama's efforts to reach out diplomatically to Iran, Gibbs said, \"The president and the prime minister [Netanyahu] both agreed on Monday that engaging the people and the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran, something that hasn't been tried for the past many years, is something that makes sense.\" Both Israel and the United States believe that Iran is seeking nuclear weapons under the guise of a civilian nuclear energy program; Tehran denies the accusation. Israeli leaders have pointed to Ahmadinejad's calls for the end of Israel as a Jewish state, and argue that quick action is needed. Netanyahu called Iran the biggest threat to peace in the region. \"If Iran were to acquire nuclear weapons, it could give a nuclear umbrella to terrorists, or worse, could actually give [them] nuclear weapons. And that would put us all in great peril,\" he said. Obama is considered to have a more conciliatory approach to the Arab and Muslim world than Netanyahu.

    "input": "(CNN) -- By qualifying fourth for the season-opening Australian Grand Prix, Michael Schumacher offered a tantalising hint he was ready to shake off the indifferent form he has displayed since returning to Formula One in 2010. The seven-time world champion's challenge in Melbourne was cut short by a 10th-lap gearbox failure, but the German insists the true strength of this year's cars and drivers will not be known until after this weekend's race in Malaysia. \"The circuit in Melbourne is not really representative of the true competitive picture,\" the Mercedes driver told the sport's official website. \"But nevertheless the car gives me a good feeling for the season ahead. F1 teams and drivers for 2012 . \"Sepang will be interesting for everybody because it will be the first clue to the real relative strengths of all the cars.\" Sunday's race was won by McLaren's 2009 world champion Jenson Button, with Red Bull's back-to-back title winner Sebastian Vettel claiming second place. Schumacher is convinced Mercedes' F1 W03 car -- which features a controversial DRS-activated F-duct device that has attracted scrutiny from other teams -- is capable of helping him and teammate Nico Rosberg challenge for honors in 2012. \"After the disappointment of how the first race in Melbourne turned out, I am flying to Malaysia with a big sense of anticipation,\" the 43-year-old said. \"We saw in Australia that our car is capable of putting us in the mix.\" Schumacher's compatriot Vettel expressed that the Sepang Circuit, where he was victorious in 2011, is a more difficult challenge than it first appears. \"It has big run-off areas and a broad track, meaning it appears easy, but it's not,\" the sport's youngest double world champion said. \"The heat, high humidity and weather aren't the only challenges, as the main thing is to find the ideal car set up. It's good to go there off the back of Australia and I hope we get another strong result.\" Ferrari came into the new campaign off the back of a disappointing preseason, with the F2012 car struggling for pace. Spanish driver Fernando Alonso, who lost his title as F1's youngest two-time champion to Vettel, put in an admirable drive last weekend to finish fifth after starting the race in 12th. The 30-year-old said changeable weather conditions in Malaysia would test the competitors. \"There is no other place in the world, the Formula One world that is, where it can go from sunshine to torrential rain in the space of a few minutes,\" he said. \"Those on the pit wall will have to keep their eyes peeled and look at the radar carefully to be ready for any possible change in the weather.\"",

The evidence was located Wednesday, Hickory, North Carolina, police said in a statement, and will be analyzed at the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation's lab. Police launched a search for Zahra Baker October 9, but said no one other than a family member has reported seeing her since September 25, when a woman saw her at a furniture store. Police did not elaborate or say what the evidence is. \"We understand the concern and interest in this case by the public, but we must be cautious in prematurely releasing information, so it will not jeopardize any future criminal proceedings,\" police said. Authorities said earlier this month a bone that might be related to the case was found. They also previously found a prosthetic leg belonging to Zahra, whose disappearance is being investigated as a homicide. Elisa Baker, Zahra's stepmother, is jailed on charges unrelated to the girl's disappearance, as well as an obstruction of justice charge related to the case after she admitted to writing a fake ransom note found at the family's home. Elisa Baker has said said she did not know what happened to Zahra, a freckle-faced girl who lost her leg to bone cancer at age 5 and reportedly developed lung cancer a few years later. Zahra's father, Adam Baker, was arrested late last month in nearby Catawba County on eight charges, including five counts of submitting worthless checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Police earlier acknowledged that Adam Baker faced bad-check charges unrelated to the disappearance of his daughter. But they did not initially arrest him, as he had been helping authorities in their search. Zahra's biological mother, Emily Dietrich, is coming to North Carolina from Australia, CNN affiliate WSOC reported. She could arrive sometime Thursday. Last week, Dietrich told Australia's Seven Network that she had little hope of seeing Zahra alive again, according to WSOC. Dietrich has not had contact with her daughter since Zahra was an infant.

Rita Chretien, 56, is tolerating solid food very well, continuing her physical therapy and showing high spirits, according to a statement by St. Luke's Magic Valley Medical Center in Twin Falls, Idaho. Meanwhile, authorities are still searching for her husband, Albert, who left his wife in their van on March 22 so that he could find help. \"She is enjoying solid foods and had a dinner of salmon, rice and green beans last night,\" the spokesman's statement said Tuesday. \"This morning she had a breakfast burrito with homemade salsa. A 'bowl of soul' coffee was brought to her from a local coffee house. It included a sprinkle of cinnamon, nutmeg and a dollop of whipped cream, which Rita said was delicious.\" Doctors said the indicators of her recovery are \"very good,\" the spokesman said. Scores of men and women had searched for the Chretiens since the Penticton, British Columbia, residents were last seen March 19 leaving a Shell gas station convenience store in Baker City, Oregon. On Friday, more than a month later, hunters wandered into the area where the van was sitting.

Rita Chretien lived off the little food she had -- beef jerky, some trail mix, fish oil pills and one piece of hard candy per day. She went outside for a walk once a day, using the sunlight to melt snow for drinking water and going to a nearby stream. She read a few books (some several times) and the Bible and recorded her thoughts in a journal.

    "input": "(CNN)  -- The head of the U.N. Children's Fund has expressed concern over a Saudi judge's refusal for a second time to annul a marriage between an 8-year-old girl and a 47-year-old man. UNICEF's Ann Veneman said consent cannot be free if either party is too young to make an informed decision. \"Irrespective of circumstances or the legal framework, the marriage of a child is a violation of that child's rights,\" said Ann Veneman, executive director of UNICEF. \"The right to free and full consent to marriage is recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Consent cannot be free and full when either party to a marriage is too young to make an informed decision.\" The most recent ruling, in which the judge upheld his original verdict, was handed down Saturday in the Saudi city of Onaiza, where late last year the same judge rejected a petition from the girl's mother, seeking a divorce for her daughter. Have your say by clicking here . A relative said the judge, Sheikh Habib al-Habib, \"stuck by his earlier verdict and insisted that the girl could petition the court for a divorce once she reached puberty.\" The family member, who requested anonymity, added that the mother will continue to pursue a divorce for her daughter. The case, which has drawn criticism from local and international rights groups, came to light in December when al-Habib declined to annul the marriage on a legal technicality. The judge ruled that the girl's mother -- who is separated from her father -- was not the girl's legal guardian and therefore could not represent her in court, Abdullah al-Jutaili, the mother's attorney, told CNN at the time. The girl's father, according to the lawyer, arranged the marriage in order to settle his debts with the man, who is a close friend of his. At the time of the initial verdict, the judge required the girl's husband to sign a pledge that he would not have sex with her until she reaches puberty, al-Jutaili told CNN. The judge ruled that when the girl reaches puberty, she will have the right to request a divorce by filing a petition with the court, the lawyer said. Last month, an appeals court in the Saudi capital of Riyadh declined to certify the original ruling, in essence rejecting al-Habib's verdict, and sent the case back to him for reconsideration. Under the complicated Saudi legal process, the appeals court ruling meant that the marriage was still in effect, but that a challenge to the marriage was still ongoing. The appeals court in Riyadh will now take up the case again and a hearing is scheduled for next month, according to the relative. The issue of child marriage has been a hot-button topic in the deeply conservative kingdom recently. While rights groups have petitioned the government for laws to protect children from such marriages, the kingdom's top cleric has said that it's OK for girls as young as 10 to wed. \"It is incorrect to say that it's not permitted to marry off girls who are 15 and younger,\" Sheikh Abdul Aziz Al-Sheikh, the kingdom's grand mufti, said in remarks last January, according to the regional Al-Hayat newspaper. \"A girl aged 10 or 12 can be married. Those who think she's too young are wrong, and they are being unfair to her.\" Al-Sheikh reportedly made the remarks when he was asked during a lecture about parents forcing their underage daughters to marry. \"We hear a lot in the media about the marriage of underage girls,\" he said, according to the newspaper. \"We should know that sharia law has not brought injustice to women.\" Sharia law is Islamic law. Saudi Arabia follows a strict interpretation of Islam called Wahhabism. CNN was unable to reach government officials for comment. Christoph Wilcke, a Saudi Arabia researcher for Human Rights Watch, told CNN in December that his organization has heard of many other cases of child marriages. \"We've been hearing about these types of cases once every four or five months because the Saudi public is now able to express this kind of anger -- especially so when girls are traded off to older men,\" Wilcke said. Wilcke said that although Saudi ministries might make decisions designed to protect children, \"It is still the religious establishment that holds sway in the courts, and in many realms beyond the court.\" In December, Zuhair al-Harithi, a spokesman for the Saudi government-run Human Rights Commission, said his organization is fighting against child marriages. \"The Human Rights Commission opposes child marriages in Saudi Arabia,\" al-Harithi said. \"Child marriages violate international agreements that have been signed by Saudi Arabia and should not be allowed.\" He added that his organization has been able to intervene and stop at least one child marriage from taking place. Wajeha al-Huwaider, co-founder of the Society of Defending Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, told CNN that achieving human rights in the kingdom means standing against those who want to \"keep us backward and in the dark ages.\" She said the marriages cause girls to \"lose their sense of security and safety. Also, it destroys their feeling of being loved and nurtured. It causes them a lifetime of psychological problems and severe depression.\"",

So get kitty lookin' pretty and start rolling! So why add the extra five-spot now? Well, on the YouTube blog, the video-sharing site explains that it's been beefing up its copyright protection tools of late, i.e. the Content ID system (which lets copyright holders have more control over their content). Therefore, it's less likely that users can, say, upload large chunks of movies and TV shows without permission. In celebration of this added time, YouTube is also launching a contest of sorts called \"15 Minutes of Fame.\" Basically, all users have to do is film a 15-minute vid, tag it with \"yt15minutes,\" and upload it by Wednesday, August 4. The chosen videos will be featured on the YouTube homepage. We wonder what effect -- if any -- this new time limit will have on initiatives like YouTube Leanback.

    "input": "Las Vegas, Nevada (CNN)  -- Nevada Republican Senate candidate Sharron Angle just might be the Tea Party's biggest gamble yet. A staunch conservative with a history of making bold and sometimes controversial comments, Angle insists her comments have been taken out of context in her campaign to oust Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid in upcoming midterm congressional elections. \"I'll be a mainstream senator,\" said Angle. A grandmother of 10 children who secured the backing of Tea Party leaders on her way to winning the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate, Angle has been both praised and criticized for her views. In past remarks during the campaign, Angle has said Social Security and Medicare should be phased out. She's also advocated the elimination of the Departments of Education and Energy, the Environmental Protection Agency and the IRS. Angle established herself as an ardent conservative during her six-year tenure in the Nevada State Assembly. \"Sharron Angle was the Tea Party before the Tea Party existed,\" Nevada political journalist Jon Ralston said of the Republican, adding she was a \"far right\" candidate. While Angle's controversial stances have bolstered her standing with the Tea Party, they have provided fodder for Democrats, who perceive the 60-year-old Tea Party candidate a threat to one of Washington's most prominent Democrats. In response, Reid has called his opponent \"too extreme\" in TV ads airing across the state, and even President Obama weighed in at a July event for Reid, saying, \"[Angle] favors an approach that's even more extreme than the Republicans we've got in Washington. That's saying something.\" When CNN caught up with Angle at one of her Las Vegas, Nevada, campaign stops, she complained some of her more controversial statements had been taken out of context. \"As you speak, as we're conversationally speaking, sometimes when you pick out words, they're not the best words you could have used,\" she told CNN in a rare one-on-one interview. \"When taken out of context, you can make anybody look like they don't know what they're talking about,\" she said. \"It's a little hard to take out of context when they say they want to phase out Social Security,\" Reid responded to CNN. \"Her words are what she is. My words are what I am. So I don't think you can run from what you say and what you do.\" Angle has also made some contentious comments on friendly conservative talk radio programs, which have bolstered her detractors' views that she is an extremist. In a January appearance on the Reno, Nevada-based Bill Manders Show, Angle implied the purpose of the Second Amendment right to bear arms might be to keep the federal government in check. \"I'm hoping that we're not getting to Second Amendment remedies. I hope that the vote will be the cure for the Harry Reid problems,\" she said, generating a slew of questions about her intent. When CNN asked about Angle's ominous-sounding warning, she laughed off the notion she was promoting an armed revolution. \"Those are not the issues people are concerned about. They're concerned about our economy, our homes, our jobs. That's what people are concerned about,\" she said, not offering an explanation of her remarks. CNN also asked Angle about her affirmation of the same conservative host's observation that there are \"home-born, homegrown\" enemies operating in Congress. \"The larger focus of that conversation is what has happened domestically here and our country for the last 18 months,\" Angle said, pointing out that no names were mentioned during the conversation, and again not addressing directly the intent of her statement. It's easy to see how Angle's staunch views appeal to the Tea Party, but even some of her fellow Nevada Republicans are wary that she is too conservative. In an interview with CNN affiliate KLAS, Reno Mayor Bob Cashell, who is a Republican from Angle's hometown, called Angle \"an ultra-right winger\" who he will not support in November. Another prominent Nevada Republican, former Rep. Barbara Vucanovich described Angle as \"rigid\" in her beliefs in an interview to the Las Vegas Review Journal. \"She's a very difficult person. She's very positive in her own way, but when you're elected you have to work for everybody,\" Vucanovich told the newspaper. But it's not just politicians who are concerned. In a poll released by the Las Vegas Review Journal on August 27, 71 percent of Nevada Republicans admit they would prefer to see a different Republican candidate take on Reid. Of those Republicans who voted for Angle in the primary election, 66 percent now say they'd like another nominee. Reid fares better with his own party, but is still far from a perfect candidate in the eyes of Nevada voters, many of whom see the high-profile Democrat as a Washington insider who brokered deals infamously known as the \"Cornhusker Kickback\" and \"The Louisiana Purchase\" to pass health care reform. \"Harry Reid is the most negatively viewed person in this state and there is a hardened opposition to him. I think Sharron Angle could be arrested for a felony tomorrow and still get percent 40 percent of the vote,\" Ralston told CNN. That explains why, despite Angle's controversial candidacy, polls show Nevada voters evenly split between the \"extremist\" challenger and the \"establishment\" senator. The high-profile race is considered a statistical dead heat where, even in the gambling capital of the world, there is no odds-on favorite, making it a bellwether of just how influential the Tea Party might be in future elections.",

(CNN) -- What you'll see in Washington in this week is a White House focus on health care and jobs. What you won't see -- or see much of, at any rate -- is just as critical a challenge for the administration. On Wednesday and then again on Friday, President Obama will meet with his national security team to continue deliberations about Afghanistan strategy, including whether to commit as many as 40,000 more U.S. troops to what not too long ago was \"the forgotten war\" but is now front and center. \"Ideally, it's better for military advice to come up through the chain of command,\" National Security Adviser James Jones told us Sunday when asked whether the very public request for more troops from the commanding general in Afghanistan had complicated the White House deliberations. Significantly, Jones, a retired Marine Corps general, offered what sounded like a more optimistic asssement of the security challenges in Afghanistan than the commander asking for more troops, Gen. Stanley McChrystal. \"I don't foresee the return of the Taliban,\" Jones said. As for al Qaeda and its strength within Afghanistan, Jones added: \"Very diminished. The maximum estimate is less than 100 reported operating in the country. No bases. No buildings to launch attacks on either us or our allies.\" His comments left little doubt Jones is not only less than thrilled about McChrystal's public appeals, he also is among those skeptical of sending more troops. Suffice to say those private strategy meetings warrant considerable attention. Easier to see will be presidential and vice presidential events pushing health care reform and promoting the administration's stimulus plan as, contrary to what Republicans say, a cushion keeping a sluggish economy from taking an even bigger toll on American workers and families. Obama will make a new health care push Monday from the White House, joined by doctors from around the country. Vice President Joe Biden continues his role as stimulus cheerleader, from Connecticut on Monday.  Also of note: . â¢ The first new Supreme Court term of the Obama presidency kicks off, and Sonia Sotomayor gets down to official business as the nation's first Hispanic high court justice. â¢ The Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday discusses potential new sanctions against Iran, proof of congressional skepticism even though Iran over the weekend agreed to let international inspectors visit its recently disclosed uranium enrichment plant. â¢ Wednesday is the eighth anniversary of the beginning of the war in Afghanistan. â¢ Wednesday also brings the Federal Reserve's latest report on consumer credit.

Didier Drogba scored for Ivory Coast as they drew 1-1 with Malawi to book their place at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Ivory Coast needed only a point from their match with the bottom-placed team in African qualifying Group E but found themselves a goal down in the 64th minute when Jacob Ngwira put the hosts ahead at the Kamuzu Stadium in Blantyre. Elephants coach Vahid Halilhodzic responded by throwing on Chelsea striker Drogba who was able to level the scores in the 67th minute. Malawi pushed for a winner as the second half wore on but were unable to add to the score and Ivory Coast secured the point they required for qualification. The result brought Ivory Coast's 100 percent run in the group to an end but ensured they will feature in the World Cup Finals for a second time following their debut appearance in 2006. Malawi also improved their chances of qualifying for the African Cup of Nations by moving third with four points, just behind Burkina Faso who have six and Guinea who are now last with three points. Elsewhere in the African qualifying zone Egypt recorded a 1-0 win over Zambia in their Group C clash in Konkola to potentially set up a deciding match with Algeria in Cairo next month. Egypt were on the back foot in the first half and were indebted to goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary who frustrated the Zambia fans with several fine saves as the visitors struggled to get to grips with the pitch at the Konkola Stadium. But the Pharaohs were a much-improved side after the half-time break and Hosny Abd-Rabou secured all three points with the only goal of the game in the 68th minute. Egypt defender Sayed Moawad laid off the ball for Abd-Rabou to fire a powerful right-footed shot past Zambia goalkeeper Kennedy Mweene and into the top corner of the net. The result means qualification will go right down to the wire even if Algeria take maximum points from their clash with bottom side Rwanda on Sunday and go three points clear of Egypt at the top of the group. Cameroon moved a step closer to qualification as they remained top of Group A with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Togo in Yaounde. The Indomitable Lions took the lead in the 32nd minute through Newcastle midfielder Geremi when he smashed home the rebound after Togo goalkeeper Kodjovi Obilale had saved his initial shot from the penalty spot. Lyon's Jean Makoun doubled the advantage two minutes after the interval after he tapped home following a mazy dribble by Samuel Eto'o and Achille Emana made the points safe in the 52nd minute with a low drive. Gabon remain a point behind Cameroon after they clinched a 3-1 win over Morocco in Libreville having taken the lead after Hicham Mahdoufi put through his own net moments before half-time. Eric Mouloungou and Daniel Cousin gave Gabon a three-goal lead before Adel Taarabt pulled one back for Morocco with a late consolation. Paul Le Guen's Cameroon side, who had looked doubtful to qualify when he took over, are in pole position at the top of the group with 10 points ahead of Gabon on nine, Togo on five and Morocco with three.",

The Sail Stadefrance Operating Company (SSOC) -- a partnership between South African events company Sail and French consortium Stadefrance -- were due to take up a 30-year lease on Cape Town's Green Point Stadium on November 1 this year. But Cape Town's residents could now end up paying for the $600 million stadium -- as the management of the venue transfers to the city in January 2011. SSOC chairman Morne du Plessis said that the company had incorrectly anticipated the amount it would take to run and maintain the stadium, estimated at around $6 million per year. \"In the light of unresolved matters that affected the viability of the lease we have advised the city that SSOC would not be in a position to enter the lease,\" du Plessis told the official website of the city of Cape Town. \"Shareholders were not prepared to enter the lease under circumstances that projected substantial losses.\" The SSOC had been managing the stadium on behalf of the city since January 2009, apart from during the World Cup when the tournaments' organizing committee were in charge. Eight World Cup matches were held at the 68,000-seat Green Point, one of five new stadiums built for the World Cup this summer. Tournament CEO Danny Jordaan promised South Africans that the new facilities would not become \"white elephants\" and would leave a legacy for generations to come. \"To ensure a lasting legacy and the commercial viability of the stadiums, they will be used for both rugby and soccer,\" Jordaan said before the World Cup. \"This country has also used sports stadiums for major political rallies, concerts and church events. They can, therefore, also be used for outside of sport,\" he added.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Wednesday night's European summit was, well, a very European summit. It lasted forever, included several dramatic moments, ended in the wee hours of the morning and delivered a highly complex result. Yet, the questions that Americans might now ask are quite simple: Has this leaders' conclave succeeded in stopping the spread of the \"contagion\" from the eurozone's sovereign debt crisis? Will the European financial disease reach America's shores and affect local jobs and livelihoods? The answer may seem somewhat paradoxical: While the Europeans have made strides to beat the virus, this crisis is anything but over. The Europeans had been asked to deploy a \"big bazooka,\" a weapon so big and so potent that it would force financial markets into submission. There could be no doubt allowed that the \"euro-Europeans\" (those who share Europe's single currency) would do absolutely everything to preserve the credibility of their currency and restore trust that investments in European bonds remain safe. In the good old days, a president, a prime minister or a chancellor (most likely male) would have stepped up, made a bold decision and presented it to the people in front of a microphone. He would appear to be determined and convinced that he was doing the right thing. Doubt was neither part of his vocabulary nor his demeanor. Indeed, those were the days of the sovereign nation state. But the eurozone is not a sovereign and not a nation. Instead of a prime minister, it has \"Merkozy\" -- German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Nicolas Sarkozy -- an odd couple who, though unelected in their roles, have stepped into a continental leadership vacuum. Their summit battles with each other and with their 15 colleagues are well-known. While the markets want certainty, Merkozy can only deliver measures saddled with national caveats because they must respect other nations' minority views. It is the nature of Europe's intergovernmental beast that defies the decisiveness that markets demand. Given the political constraints and the convoluted nature of the decision-making, Merkozy and friends have certainly delivered. The complexity of the challenge in the uncharted territory of a monetary union without joint fiscal authority cannot be overstated. Merkozy have lightened the debt load of Greece considerably by talking the banks into a loss of 50% on the face value of their Greek loans; they have ring-fenced other weak nations by introducing a recapitalization mechanism for banks; they have leveraged the existing bailout fund -- the European Financial Stability Facility -- to a maximum capacity of $ 1.4 trillion; they have pressured Italy into another round of structural and budget reforms; and they have agreed to improve the governance of the currency union by way of treaty change. Not bad for a long weekend that ended Thursday morning. The markets, after initially reacting favorably, will try to poke holes in the carefully constructed edifice. The leaders themselves will have given the markets all the cues. Such is the nature of a consensus body of national leaders that no disagreement and no doubt goes unnoticed, all preparatory documents -- including risk assessments -- have been leaked. Soon, market participants will focus on the architecture of the leveraged bailout fund and its two new special-purpose vehicles, which will be open to outside investors. It is still unknowable whether markets will consider them safe, given that the Europeans, especially the Germans, have insisted on insurance of limited rather than unlimited liability, to guarantee against some of the losses that bondholders might suffer. Most importantly, the leaders cannot control what the banks do next. They might seek new capital -- as is suggested to them -- to reach the new core capital requirement of 9% by next summer. But they might also shrink their balance sheets to get there, thus contributing to a credit crunch and economic contraction. Their participation in the Greek \"haircut\" has been framed as voluntary. But in reality, at that level of a write-down, they are more interested in being forced into an agreement that the markets call a credit event. Such an event triggers an insurance payment to the investors (an insurance scheme called credit default swap kicks in to minimize bank losses). The European leaders want to avoid such a situation for risk of contagion. It will still be quite a dance to avoid the credit event. Again, the outcome is unknowable today. In the end, markets might find that Europe's big bazooka is really mid-sized. In fact, the last few days have revealed that the European firepower is limited. France cannot spend much more cash without endangering the country's triple-A rating. If it loses the top rating, the bailout fund will be downgraded as well, thus increasing Germany's liability. At that point, the whole bailout building will look flimsy. Therefore, it is time for others to come to the rescue. Up until now, the United States has resisted increasing the International Monetary Fund's (and thus also America's) financial involvement. But Washington will need to reconsider, for two reasons of self-interest: The crisis spans the Atlantic, and the two economies are deeply integrated. There will be no American recovery without stabilization in Europe. Thursday morning, the French president talked to the Chinese premier to convince him to invest in Europe's new special-purpose vehicle. Will America want to lose its leverage over Europe to China? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Admitted killer John Albert Gardner III bowed his head and wept at his sentencing Friday as the parents of his teen victims called him a monster and coward for raping and murdering their daughters. At the end of the hourlong hearing, the convicted sex offender was sentenced by Judge David Danielsen to three consecutive terms of life without parole for murdering Chelsea King and Amber Dubois and attacking a jogger. The case has sparked calls for tougher penalties against sex offenders. Dressed in a green jailhouse jumpsuit, his gaze on the floor, Gardner became emotional as the parents took turns attempting to articulate the agony of their losses before a packed courtroom in San Diego Superior Court. The themes of their statements alternated between celebrations of the teens' lives and expressions of rage directed at Gardner. \"Look at me,\" Kelly King, Chelsea's mother, tearfully demanded of her daughter's killer after taking the podium. She paused and waited as a red-faced Gardner slowly lifted his eyes, casting a quick glance at her before shutting them. \"What I feel is so much deeper than I ever dare to express in a public forum. There are things I'd like to say, but to protect my son and to maintain the dignity of my family, my words will be far too mild to adequately speak the disgusting truth about you,\" she said tearfully, trembling as she spoke. \"Chelsea was a sweet, loving and innocent soul who could not have fathomed the wretched piece of evil that ended her beautiful life on that day.\" Gardner, 31, pleaded guilty April 16 to raping and murdering the San Diego-area teens in a deal with prosecutors that spared him the death penalty. He also pleaded guilty to assault with intent to commit rape of a jogger who managed to fight him off. CNN does not name survivors of sexual assault. The young woman also addressed Gardner in open court Friday. \"As a runner, I've always gloried in the peace that comes in the utter solitude of a long run,\" said the woman, who was attacked in December 2009. \"In a single instance, this man took from me the safety and solitude of my own mind.\" She said it was important for her to appear in court to represent the slain teens, despite the \"pain and guilt\" she feels as a survivor. \"I came here to stand today as a witness for Chelsea and Amber. I came to watch as justice is served for the horrifying acts he has committed,\" she said, fighting back tears. \"I come here today for all the women who have ever been victims of violence, to ask with Chelsea and Amber's voices to remove this man from our world, to make us a little safer by locking him up permanently. King was also running on a trail near the Rancho Bernardo Community Park on February 28 when Gardner attacked her and dragged her to a remote area, according to court documents. He raped and stabbed the 17-year-old and buried her body in a shallow grave. He was arrested three days later, after his DNA was matched to semen found on her clothes. During the emotional hearing, Gardner was called an animal, monster and sociopath. King's father, Brent, said the most appropriate name for the registered sex offender was \"coward.\" \"As I thought about what I would say to you today, I realized that names like 'monster and 'animal' in a perverse way let you off the hook. You knew what you were doing when you chose to wait for and corner Chelsea,\" King said. \"The most fitting name for you is 'coward.' You are not a man. You are just a weak, pathetic coward who preys on unsuspecting young girls half your size. You are evil not because of some sickness or disease, so don't blame anything or anyone for your crimes. You intentionally chose evil and now you have to live with that evil festering inside you and eating you up as you rot in a prison cell for the rest of your life.\" Dubois, 14,  was last seen alive walking to Escondido High School on February 13, 2009. She was considered a missing person for more than a year, until Gardner led authorities to her remains in March -- after his arrest in King's death -- in exchange for assurances that it would not be used against him in court. Gardner admitted to raping and stabbing Dubois and burying her in a shallow grave in a remote area near Pala, according to court documents. Without the plea deal, San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis said last month, her office did not have enough evidence to charge Gardner in the death of Dubois. After 15 months of wondering about her daughter, Dubois' mother said knowing her fate brought little closure. To understand her grief, Carrie McGonigle said, you had to know Dubois for the loving and gentle-hearted person known to friends and family -- a bookish animal lover who chose Barnes and Noble over the mall. \"The day she was abducted her backpack was filled with valentines for her friends and joy in her heart because she was carrying a check to adopt a baby lamb for a school project. To appreciate the profound kindness and love that has been stolen from my life, you only need to understand how truly excited she was about the opportunity to nurture another living thing.\" In addition to the victim impact statements, the King family also submitted a video of their daughter's friends describing the vivacious teen's gift for bringing intense passion to music, athletics and personal relationships. \"The thing I love most about Chelsea was the conviction and passion for everything she did and everyone she loved,\" one male friend said. Not long after Gardner's arrest, King's parents vowed to push for tougher sentencing guidelines for violent sex offenders and more intensive monitoring of parolees. California's \"Chelsea's Law\" calls for life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for any forcible sex crime against minors that includes one or more aggravating factors, including the victim's age or whether the victim was tied, bound or drugged. The bill also would institute more intensive monitoring of parolees and lifelong GPS tracking in some cases. Gardner's history with the state parole board also led Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to order a review of the system. He was paroled on September 26, 2005, after serving five years for two counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child under 14 and one count of false imprisonment for attacking a 13-year-old neighbor. In September 2007, he incurred a parole violation when his parole agent found that the college he was living near had a day care center and he was asked to move. When it was determined that he had found compliant housing, he was discharged from parole and removed from GPS monitoring on September 26, 2008. Speaking to the court, Dubois' father lamented that the justice system did not heed the warning of a doctor who recommended that Gardner receive as much prison time as possible before his incarceration in 2000. \" 'The defendant does not suffer from a psychotic disorder. He is simply a bad guy who is inordinately interested in young girls,' \" Dubois said, quoting a report from psychiatrist Matthew Carroll, who evaluated Gardner. \"Again, I cannot help to ask on behalf of my family, who is at fault here? Is it this cold, heartless monster, is it the failures in the law enforcement systems or perhaps it is even us who have not forced and held accountable the people and the organizations who are supposed to protect us from these predators?\" Echoing statements he made at Gardner's plea hearing, Brent King said his family would have preferred the death penalty, but knew it was an \"empty promise\" in California. The father also laid blame on the killer's mother for not ensuring that he was registered at her address, a condition of his parole, or notifying police of his residency when the girls went missing. \"Your mother, Cathy Osborne, knew what you were capable of and did nothing to protect us from you. She knew who you were after you violently beat and tried to rape that poor 13-year-old girl a decade ago,\" he said. \"She harbored you, indulged you and put every child in our community at risk. ... Ms. Osborne, you have Chelsea's rape and murder and our pain on your soul.\" Mary Duval, chief executive officer for the Sex Offender Solutions and Education Network, an advocacy group for registered sex offenders, said anger-induced legislation is not the answer. \"If the current reform efforts focus on punishing and restricting all former sex offenders instead of those who are the most dangerous, the goal of protecting children will once again be foiled due to anger, fear and misinformation ruling the day,\" she said. \"The facts of the Chelsea King and Amber DuBois cases should be enough to persuade politicians and the families to look for better answers.\"",

    "input": "(CNN)  -- At least 23 people died Saturday when a protest rally turned violent outside Madagascar's Presidential Palace, a fire official at the main hospital said. People duck to avoid gunfire Saturday in Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar. The official said 83 people were injured during the demonstration in the capital city of Antananarivo, according to journalist Dregoire Pourtier, who passed the information to CNN. The International Committee of the Red Cross helped at least 18 injured people, press officer Mbola Ramamanana said. Brittany Martin, an American who is a Harvard Fellow and lives near the palace, said she could hear the crowd cheering amid intermittent gunshots and noises that may have been tear gas canisters. iReport.com: Are you there? \"From the window I can see military cars and ambulances driving by,\" Martin said. \"Nothing is up in smoke. We know there have been people killed from French and Malagasy news reports. \"We can see the back of the president's palace. This morning was totally peaceful. We knew that Andry [Rajoelina] was unveiling his new government at the May 13th Plaza, which was peaceful,\" she said, citing a friend who was there. Madagascar's government is in flux. President Marc Ravalomanana fired Rajoelina as mayor of Antananarivo and put someone else in the job, but Rajoelina is still technically mayor and claims to head a transitional national government. Martin said she heard gunshots starting about 2 p.m., after the protesters marched from the plaza to the palace. She said it was unclear where the shots were coming from. Some media reports blamed foreign mercenaries for the shootings; others said army guards were responsible or that the army was firing at the mercenaries to protect the crowd. Violence in Madagascar began January 26, when protesters stormed state-run television and radio stations in Antananarivo. Hours earlier, the government had shut down a radio station owned by Rajoelina and, weeks before, had similarly shut down Rajoelina's television station after it aired an interview with ex-President Didier Ratsiraka. Ravalomanana took power in 2001 after ousting Ratsiraka in a tense, hotly contested election. Ratsiraka fled to France afterward. Loyalists blame Ratsiraka's family members for inciting the recent trouble. There is also anger in Madagascar -- where the World Bank says the average person earns about $320 a year -- over reports that Ravalomanana recently bought a $60 million airplane. Last Saturday, Rajoelina took to the streets, declaring himself the nation's leader after a week of violence and looting that killed at least 80 people and wounded more than 300. Rajoelina urged supporters to demand the resignation of Ravalomanana and said he planned to take charge until a transition government can be established in the island nation off Africa's southeastern coast.  Map Â» . \"What we've been pushing for is dialogue the whole time,\" said Rodney Ford, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy. He said he received reports that palace guards used tear gas and shot into the air to try to disperse the crowd. \"I don't think anyone wanted violence.\" According to the U.S. State Department, Madagascar has about 20 million people with ethnic origins in Africa and Asia. It was administered by the British Empire during much of the 19th century until it came under the control of France, from which it gained independence in 1960.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Malawi's decision to reject pop star Madonna's adoption of a local child has reignited global debate about the ethics of international adoption. Author Melissa Fay Greene poses with her family, which includes biological and adopted children. Some international aid groups have praised the decision as best for the child, a 4-year-old girl named Chifundo James. \"I think it really highlights the bigger picture that there are so many children living in poverty in Malawi, and while Madonna has good intentions ... children would be better off staying in their own communities whenever possible,\" said Karen Hansen-Kuhn, policy director for ActionAid USA, a development group that also works in Malawi. \"We really need to stay focused on the needs of Malawi and of all the children there,\" she added. To get another perspective on the situation, CNN also talked with Melissa Fay Greene, an author and mother of five adopted children. Greene, who lives in Atlanta, Georgia, is the mother of four biological children, four children adopted from Ethiopia and one adopted child from Bulgaria. The following is an edited transcript of that conversation: . CNN: What's your initial reaction to the news that Madonna's adoption of a Malawian child has been rejected? Greene: Surprise. ... It was awfully tricky with Madonna's first adoption, when the child turned out to have devoted family members nearby. [The singer's adoption of a Malawian boy was finalized last year.] And if that's true with this child also, it seems a similar sticky situation. That's not the situation for the majority of orphanage children around the world, who don't have caring grandparents or aunts and uncles a short walk or bike ride away. I think it gives people an odd perspective on what international adoption can mean for children who don't have any support network outside the walls of an orphanage. You often hear attacks on international adoption as robbing a child of his or her culture, and that's both true and false. It's true that an internationally adopted child loses the rich background of history and religion and culture and language that the child was born into, but the cruel fact is that most children don't have access to the local, beautiful culture within an orphanage. ... There's a culture in orphanages that children are eager to escape from, and it's a culture of being reared as a group and not being doted upon by parents. For any child, that's the bottom line. The fact is that a human child wants that mommy or daddy or both. We're just wired to want that and to need that. And there's no way an institutional setting can give a human baby what the child needs. It's impossible. So you have to balance priorities. ... I think what some of the human rights group say is absolutely accurate: that international adoption does not begin to solve the problems of the world's orphaned children. It's truly not the answer. ... At the same time, international adoption, even though it doesn't solve the whole problem, it solves a problem for a few. I think it can be a brilliant solution to the problem of adults wanting a child in their lives or wanting more children in their lives and the problem of children who want parents in their lives. CNN: How is it different for a celebrity person seeking an [international] adoption than for yourself? Greene: We don't jet in, take a child and fly out with a child. For an average citizen trying to adopt, it takes most of a year. First of all, you work with a country that already has international adoption regulations in place, so you have a bureaucracy dealing with international adoption. A big part of that is determining that the child is a true orphan, that there is no one who can care for the child. And in the case of our older kids' adoptions, people had to come to court to testify that there was no one to take the children. So you don't run the risk of 'Oh, whoops, there's a grandmother down the street.' ... CNN: There's been some chatter today online questioning why a person wouldn't adopt an orphaned child from their own country. Greene: Within the adoption world, it's a non-issue. There are children all over the world who need families, and some find their children in Philadelphia, and some find their children in Bulgaria, you know? ... It's just outsiders who look on and judge disapprovingly, but then they don't go on to adopt the neighborhood children, right? ... There are many children who need help, and anyone who wants to reach out and adopt a child from foster care or from a Russian orphanage should reach out and do it. CNN: What has the experience been like for your own foster children? Greene: We're a white Jewish family in Atlanta, but Atlanta is a major city for eastern African immigrants. So our children are in touch with the Ethiopian diaspora, and they feel very much a part of that. Atlanta is full of Ethiopian restaurants, markets, festivals. For a while, my kids were playing on weekends with an Ethiopian soccer league. I have an Ethiopian baby sitter who speaks to them only in Amharic so they won't lose their language, and we always have Ethiopian food here. Two years ago, we went back to Ethiopia with the kids and had a big reunion for one of my sons and his extended family ... We just consider ourselves sort of part of this amazing bicontinental family. CNN: The first time you adopted internationally, can you tell me what your ethical considerations were and how you worked through that personally? Greene: Our first adoption was of a boy in rural Bulgaria. An incredibly poor orphanage. The kids were hungry, thirsty, no education. I first met our son, Jesse, when he was 4. He was 4 years old, and he did not know what his own name was ... When he first came, he was just so anxious about food. When he would wake up, he was just shaking, wondering if there was going to be enough food. So I started waking him up with food. He had issues with water. He wasn't sure if there was going to be enough water to drink, so I bought him a little canteen so he could wear his water all of the time. Do I have ethical issues about taking him out of that orphanage? I don't. CNN: Is there anything else you wanted to add? Greene: I admire Madonna. And I don't understand why everyone attacks Madonna. I think that she is in part trying to raise the world's consciousness about the African orphan crisis. You know, 95 percent of the children orphaned by AIDS [globally] are in sub-Saharan Africa. You don't hear world leaders talking about it. Where is the global outrage? ... So, into the breach steps a celebrity. But don't attack her for it, you know. Maybe her methods are not what ours would be, but how many of us are Madonna? But at least she is out there; she's creating a school. Obviously, she's fallen in love with the Malawian children to such an extent she wants to make some of them her own. And I think that it's great. I just don't understand why the world's attacking her. Let other people step forth and do something. At least she's trying. That's my feeling.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- Terrorists intent on striking commercial aircraft have shown renewed interest in surgically implanting explosives in humans to circumvent airport security, a U.S. security official tells CNN. The idea of implanting bombs has been discussed in the past, but the United States has obtained fresh intelligence about the desire of terrorists to implant devices, according to the official. Another U.S. official said Ibrahim Hasan al-Asiri, the top bomb maker for al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), is suspected of being behind the latest efforts. \"He's AQAP's bomb guy,\" said the official. Asiri is also believed to be behind the thwarted 2009 Christmas day \"underwear\" bomb, the failed October 2010 cargo plane bomb and an attempt to kill a Saudi prince using a concealed bomb . Both officials said there is no specific or imminent threat. But the new intelligence prompted officials last week to brief international airlines and U.S. allies overseas, a Transportation Security Administration spokesman said. \"We are treating this information seriously, and as a precautionary matter, sharing it with our colleagues overseas and of course U.S. carriers who travel overseas,\" TSA Administrator John Pistole told CNN. \"We see this as the latest iteration or the evolution of what terrorist groups are trying to do to circumvent our security layers and to perhaps defeat our societal norms,\" he said. \"The information is that terrorists are aware of this type of technique and interested in using it, but there is no specific threat as to a date and time and a specific flight,\" he said. The TSA said full-body scanners can not see underneath skin, but said other \"overlapping layers of security\" could help officials deter any plot involving a human bomb. Those layers include intelligence information about possible plots, equipment that checks for minute traces of explosives, behavior detection officers and canine teams. \"All of those layers of security gives us the strongest defense and the best opportunity to detect and deter this from happening,\" Pistole said Wednesday. TSA spokesman Nicholas Kimball said passengers flying from international locations to U.S. destinations may notice additional security measures in place. Measures may include interaction with passengers, in addition to the use of other screening methods such as pat-downs and the use of enhanced tools and technologies, Kimball said. \"These measures are designed to be unpredictable, so passengers should not expect to see the same activity at every international airport,\" Kimball said. A trauma surgeon contacted by CNN said terrorists could use a variety of techniques to conceal bombs in a human, ranging from crude surgery that would likely result in infections, fever and other complications, to more sophisticated procedures that would take greater skill, but could last a long time before causing problems. Terrorists could replicate a cosmetic device, such as a breast or buttock implant, said Dr. Jack Sava, of the Washington Hospital Center. \"In many types of infections after surgery, there can be a kind of honeymoon period of a few days. But once you get several days after the operation, I think that's when you'd start to see signs that would begin with pain and fever. That would get worse and worse, and ultimately be fatal if nothing were done,\" he said. An aviation security consultant said news of terrorists' interest in implants shows the \"continuous competition between terrorists and the defenders, where we always try to be one step ahead, and they try to do the same.\" \"I think we have come to the point where our technology capabilities have been exhausted to the limit, and right now there's no further technology that can be applied to mitigate this kind of risk,\" said consultant Rafi Ron. The TSA does not have the option of subjecting people to medical doses of X-rays to find concealed objects, he said. \"So we are very much now one step behind (terrorists), rather than one step ahead.\" Ron said the TSA is right to focus more attention on airline passengers, instead of on the bags they carry. A person with an implant bomb would likely exhibit signs of stress that could be detected by trained personnel, Ron said. \"One thing obviously is an elevated level of stress, and in (the case of a human bomb) it would probably be extreme,\" Ron said. \"You may also see some influence of drugs to ease pain.\" CNN Correspondent Brian Todd, National Security Producer Pam Benson and Producer Dugald McConnell contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- When was the last time you heard someone say it's important to hire a qualified white person for a job? No, seriously, I really want you to think about that question. Whenever there is a discussion about diversity, inclusion or affirmative action, we always hear folks say, \"We do a great job of trying to find qualified minorities.\" That always tickles me, because when it comes to hiring whites, the assumption is that all are qualified, so there's no need for the qualifier \"qualified.\" That was the first thing that came to mind when former New Hampshire Gov. John Sununu gave his opinion on \"Piers Morgan Tonight\" on Thursday regarding Gen. Colin Powell's endorsement of President Barack Obama. Booker: Sununu's comment was 'unfortunate' \"Frankly, when you take a look at Colin Powell, you have to wonder whether that's an endorsement based on issues or whether he's got a slightly different reason for preferring President Obama,\" Sununu said. When Morgan asked him what that reason is, Sununu said, \"Well, I think when you have somebody of your own race that you're proud of being president of the United States, I applaud Colin for standing with him.\" Oh, John, you're such a charmer to say you applaud Colin Powell for being a righteous brother and supporting his brother from another mother. All I could do was laugh at how incredibly stupid and asinine Sununu's remark was. But Sununu isn't alone. He's like the many idiots who have e-mailed and tweeted me over the years, suggesting that comments perceived as favorable to Obama boil down to our skin color. Accomplishments? Oh, no. Intellect? Forget about it. It's always a black thing. News: Obama and the white vote . See, I'm not one of these black folks who are quick to deny that anyone voted for Obama because he's black. Actor Samuel L. Jackson has made it clear that he backs Obama because he's black, and he doesn't give a damn what any white person thinks. But it really is Sam's responsibility to tell us exactly why he supports the president. It's not our job to automatically assume that skin color is the reason during this season. For instance, in 2004, the Rev. Al Sharpton ran for president of the United States. Now, we know he's black, but a ton of black folks didn't even think of supporting him during his run or send him a dime. I recall betting a black New York media executive a big steak dinner that Sharpton would not win the primary in South Carolina, where nearly half of the voters are black. He was adamant it would happen, citing the Rev. Jesse Jackson's win there in 1988. Sharpton didn't win. During that same primary, former U.S. Sen. Carol Moseley Braun also ran for the Democratic nomination. Her campaign was about as ineffectual as Sharpton's, and few people, even black folks, backed her. Opinion: Why isn't Colin Powell a Democrat? Amazing. Two black folks running for president -- one a prominent civil rights activist and the other a former U.S. senator -- and black America as a whole didn't even give their candidacies a thought. So if in Sununu's mind a Powell endorsement comes down to race, how does he explain the many times a black candidate runs for office, and black support isn't guaranteed? What about all of the years black folks voted for white candidates? Was one whiter than the other? Since Sununu thinks it's about race, I need him to explain to me how Mitt Romney's whiteness has been the deciding factor behind his being a major surrogate for the Romney campaign. Please tell us, John, why you think Romney is the Great White Hope who will take down Soul Brother No. 1 at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Turnabout is fair play, right? If Powell is backing Obama because he's black, I need all of Romney's white supporters who are backing him because of the color of his skin to step forward. Please, don't hold back. Powell is an American hero. He has served as national security adviser, head of the U.S. Army Forces Command, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, secretary of state. Opinion: Both parties have a huge race problem . As a distinguished military man who has worked for four U.S. presidents, he has witnessed up close and personal what it takes to be president of the United States and commander in chief. It is ridiculous to assume Powell would be so shallow as to think race is the only determinant for him. The suggestion is beneath him. So, why did Sununu say it? Because it's easy to dismiss an accomplished black man who just praised another accomplished black man. By boiling it down to race, it's easy for others who think such a thing to say, \"Oh, that's it!\" Unfortunately, we see this type of thinking in America all of the time. I crack up when someone white e-mails me, saying I owe my job to affirmative action. Their bigotry and racial animus is obvious, and I e-mail them back saying, I'm laughing at them. Why? Because it must hurt more to have a black man they can't stand laugh at them. My accomplishments are clear and many. I owe no one an explanation for my success, and Powell owes Sununu and no one else an explanation other that what he said on CBS's morning show, citing Romney's confusing foreign policy views and Obama's steady leadership. \"When he took over, the country was in very, very difficult straits. We were in one of the worst recessions we had seen in recent times, close to a depression,\" Powell said. \"We were in real trouble. \"I saw over the next several years stabilization come back in the financial community. Housing is now starting to pick up after four years. It's starting to pick up. Consumer confidence is rising. So I think generally, we've come out of the dive, and we're starting to gain altitude. It doesn't mean we are problem solved. There are lots of problems still out there. The unemployment rate is too high. People are still hurting in housing. But I see that we are starting to rise up.\" Ain't nothing like a critically thinking brother, right, John? This issue will not get a rise out of President Obama or Gen. Colin Powell. They won't even dignify Sununu and others who think like them. They'll just keep laughing all the way up the ladder to the next successful step, marveling at the childishness of some whites to reduce black support of another African-American to just the color of their skin and not the content of their character. The opinions expressed in this country are solely those of Roland Martin.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Get four successful women together on a movie set and you'd think it's all claws, all the time. Some rumors would insinuate that \"Sex and the City's\" Kim Cattrall doesn't get along with her co-star Kristin Davis, while another would allege there were catfights on the set of the sequel, as the stars revealed in the June issue of Marie Claire magazine. Last week there was a similar tiff making headlines, although the spat seemed to be a bit one-sided. In an interview with Out magazine, pop star Christina Aguilera referred to fellow superstar Lady Gaga as a \"newcomer\" who was \"fun to look at,\" but Aguilera posted a statement on her website claiming that there wasn't any malice behind those words. \"It is very easy for comments to be taken out of context and create unnecessary drama -- especially between us women,\" Aguilera said in the statement. \"So I would like to tell you all directly so my words cannot be misconstrued to sell someone else's story. ... I have absolutely nothing against Lady Gaga or any other female artist in this business.\" As Aguilera noted in her statement, this isn't the first time she's \"been unfairly pitted against another female artist.\" If Aguilera or the \"Sex and the City\" stars really are estranged from other famous women, so be it -- but why no mention of their relationship with co-stars Chris Noth or John Corbett? For that matter, where are the stories about how the male actors got along on the set? \"There are hardly ever any stories about male celebrities fighting,\" said celebrity blogger Vera Sweeney, who runs IAmNotObsessed.com. \"Even when Shia LaBeouf got into that car accident while on a date with Isabel Lucas -- even though she was dating Adrian Grenier at the time -- nothing happened. Adrian said they weren't serious, and the story was dropped.\" Obviously, this doesn't mean that male celebrities are never pitted against one another in the media -- take a look at earlier beefs between Kid Rock and Tommy Lee, Eminem and Moby or Nas and Jay-Z. The difference, said Robert Thompson, director of the Bleier Center for Television and Popular Culture at Syracuse University, is that those battles are often steeped with violent overtones, and they're treated with more severity than the disputes female celebrities are rumored to have. Or, Sweeney said, the \"celebrity men in conflict\" angle will be given a different spin. \"Instead of there being a power struggle or an emotional issue, different work ethics will most likely be cited,\" she said. \"For example, when Christian Bale and Johnny Depp filmed 'Public Enemy' it was said that both men wanted to stay in character even when they weren't shooting. So it was understood why they weren't friendly with one another in between takes -- because they were 'in character.' If two women did that, it would be pitched as a cover-up for a more deep[ly] rooted reason.\" The actresses themselves seem to accept it as just another part of an oft-dirty business. \"The chemistry among the four of us is very strong, [but] ... the press has to put women in these boxes, rather than show them as the movie portrays them: working together and being powerful,\" Cattrall said in the Marie Claire interview. \"Things just have to be explosive for no other reason than for people's imaginations.\" A likely reason for the media coverage, explained pop culture expert and \"The Cult of Celebrity\" author Cooper Lawrence, is because \"it's much easier to believe that women don't like each other. It's one of the few bastions of sexism that's left in our culture, and we can't imagine that powerful, successful women could ever get along.\" It all boils down to the gender norms many of us are raised with, Thompson said. \"One theory we can reject is that the women are fighting with each other more than the men are. ... Anyone who's been in a workplace knows that it's not an inherently gender-specific sort of thing,\" Thompson said. But \"with the gender norms that we've all grown up with, men manifest their 'cattiness' differently than women; we're OK with the idea that women are emotional, and we expect them to be.\" But said Ian Drew, senior editor of celebrity magazine Us Weekly, you can't discount the reality of the entertainment industry -- and that's to sell albums and rack up box-office numbers. \"Obviously, this is a competition,\" Drew said. \"People need to be responsible for their own actions -- [Aguilera] did say those words, and she said those things for a reason. Lady Gaga, for example, never says anything negative about anybody.\" If these stars wouldn't send the media smoke signals with their words or actions, Drew said, the media wouldn't start yelling fire. \"No one is a victim in the celebrity world,\" he added. \"Very few of those rumors end up not being true.\" Regardless of whether they're true or not, Sweeney said she's willing to bet the stories of this starlet being angry at that one aren't likely to let up anytime soon. \"The question isn't why are these stories about women catfights being created,\" she said. \"Unfortunately, the question is why not? People enjoy the drama, and drama and divalike behavior sells.\"",

They're the funniest, smartest, weirdest (in a good way!) gaggle of broads I've ever met and I feel lucky every day to have them around. It wasn't always this way. I've had to prune my posse (please note that I've also been kicked out of people's lives as well) and have discovered some types to avoid. Drama queen . The Drama Queen isn't happy (and \"happy\" is a relative term here) unless she's freaking out. Little things us boring normals would shrug off -- like a missed bus or parking ticket -- become monumental shriekfests. She doesn't get the flu, she gets oh-my-god-I-think-it's-cancer! Everything is a crisis, and she demands constant handholding and attention. The Frisky: 13 signs she's a loser . Luckily, these types can't help but reveal their true colors pretty quickly and unless you're content to be cast as an extra in your own life, you'll banish her from the set. Nurse Betty . There is nothing that makes this one as happy as a friend in need. This may seem like a good quality (and often is -- for a while), but once you've got your butt back in gear, she either loses interest or, worse, reminds you constantly of how bad things once were, in the hopes that you'll fall back into feeling like crap so she can \"save\" you again. The Frisky: Is it evil to talk a friend out of getting married? You have two choices with this type -- either arrange it so you're constantly in crisis, or pretend you're problem-free so she gets bored. Better yet, introduce her to the drama queen --they'll be very happy together. Lady-hater . \"I don't have female friends because all the women I meet are jealous of me.\" Yes, someone actually said this to me. Instead, this person prefers her friends to be of the male variety -- ideally hopelessly in love with her and willing to do her bidding. The Frisky: How do grown women make friends? You don't really have to worry about ditching this snot because she doesn't want anything to do with you in the first place. The critic . Also known as the frenemy, the critic is chockfull of helpful suggestions. For instance, you know your favorite dress? Well, it makes you look kind of fat. No offense. Speaking of which -- have you gained a little weight? Or are you pregnant? Are you sure? Well, never mind, you can have some of her old \"fat\" clothes since she has no use for them anymore. Understandably, Critics have a fairly high turnover rate in the friend department. I unfriended one such mean girl only to have her show up at a mutual friend's birthday party -- for the sole purpose of telling the birthday girl exactly what was wrong with her! Â¡Feliz CumpleaÃ±os! The leg humper . Do you know what it's like to walk into a bar and find one of your closest friends making out with the guy you've had a crush on for an entire year? I do! Granted, that's nowhere near as bad as my friend Melissa who discovered her husband was schtupping her BFF, but still. It stung. And sure, nobody forced Melissa's husband to be a cheating jerk, but a good girlfriend never would've gone there with him. The Frisky: Why you should not pursue a taken man . You'll know when you're in the presence of one of these bottom-feeders by the way you become invisible the second there's a guy in the vicinity. So yeah, I had to learn the hard way. But having been put through the wringer by these types of lady-scoundrels makes me doubly appreciate the awesome dames I still have in my life. The Frisky: When good friends go bad .

    "input": "(CNN) -- Michael Vick, the comeback story like no other -- the nation's largest ongoing rehabilitation project not named Sheen -- makes his postseason splash Sunday night. A bigger audience means more fans than ever face this question: Can I embrace the Philadelphia quarterback's singular talents without getting the blood of past sins on me? It's been more than 19 months since Vick's release from federal prison in Leavenworth, Kansas, on his dogfighting conviction. And still the debate over his crime and his place back at the forefront of the NFL achieves spectacular extremes. Within two days in late December, the president of the United States congratulated Philadelphia Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie for giving Vick a second chance while a Fox News analyst suggested that Vick should have been executed for his crime. But this process of redemption also works itself out quietly, modestly, one oil change at a time. A Nissan dealer in Woodbury, New Jersey, has a played a small role in reintroducing Vick to the segment of society that doesn't kill dogs for sport. Thomas McMenamin, executive manager of the dealership, was the first businessman to sign the ex-con QB to an endorsement deal. Before the feds started digging around Vick's Bad Newz Kennels in Virginia, he was the hottest property in the league, making a reported $7 million a year in endorsements. Afterward, he was an untouchable. Now, for a series of promotional appearances and one television spot, he reportedly is receiving the free use of a $50,000 Nissan Armada. \"When we first met, he wasn't ashamed to admit that he did wrong and was wrong,\" McMenamin said. Would you buy a car from Michael Vick? McMenamin said the response has been mostly positive. \"We have gotten some phone calls from people saying, 'We'll never buy a car from you again,' but a lot of those came from out of town, from people who wouldn't buy here anyway.\" To help ease the expected criticism, the dealership struck a promotional arrangement in which it would donate to the local humane society for every car sold until the end of January. McMenamin estimates the total should amount to $10,000. One episode last month struck the manager as telling. A customer came to him irate over how long it had taken the service department to perform a simple oil change. He left dramatically, vowing never to return. The next day, McMenamin's phone rang. It was the same disaffected customer. He had seen the Vick commercial that night. \"You gave Michael Vick a second chance, and I'm willing to give your store a second chance\" are the words McMenamin remembers. Sport has always had its gamblers and rogues, its cheats and addicts. In one Super Bowl night in Atlanta, Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis became part of a double murder case (he eventually pleaded to misdemeanor obstruction of justice). The following year, 2001, he was the Super Bowl MVP. There'd be none of the usual failings for Vick, though. Like his skill set of speed, elusiveness and arm strength, his downfall had to be so out of the norm as to challenge belief. He'd bankroll a dog fighting ring. The cruelty of Vick's crime was spelled out in unsettling detail in the indictment against him, in passages such as: . \"In or about April 2007 (Purnell) Peace, (Quanis) Phillips and Vick executed approximately eight dogs that did not perform well in \"testing\" sessions by various methods including hanging, drowning and slamming at least one dog's body to the ground.\" And the price he paid for his crime was steep: 23 months in prison, three years probation, bankruptcy and great heapings of public scorn. But fans love a good comeback story, and they are quick to grant forgiveness to those who lead them back to the top of the standings. Now, with Vick, they are being asked to process an entirely foreign kind of crime along with a startling kind of ability. It's like trying to read a Greek tragedy -- in Greek. After serving as a backup with the Eagles in 2009, Vick took over the starting role early this season. The team had shed its longtime marquee quarterback, Donovan McNabb, with plans of plugging in Kevin Kolb as his successor. But Kolb suffered a concussion, and Vick rediscovered his Vickness. At 30, he appeared to be a star at peak brightness. Against Washington in November, he put on such a show -- passing for four touchdowns and rushing for two others -- that the Hall of Fame requested his jersey. He threw for more than 300 yards three times in a month. (During six seasons in Atlanta, he had done that only twice.) Throwing for a career-high 21 touchdowns, with only six interceptions, he was 8-3 as an Eagles starter and led them to a division title. On Sunday, versus Green Bay, Vick returns to the site of his last playoff appearance, this time leading the home team at Philadelphia's Lincoln Financial Field. It has been seven eventful years since he last played the postseason. And that was a largely forgettable performance, the Atlanta Falcons losing in the 2003 NFC championship by 17 and their quarterback rendered practically invisible. He enters this game with an injured leg, and his last start, a loss to Minnesota, was his least productive of the season. But it's so much more than the numbers with Vick; it's how he amasses them. Dan Reeves, Vick's first coach in Atlanta and an unabashed supporter, is an old-school, understated football lifer. But on the subject of Vick, he raves: . \"(Vick's) just exciting. I love what Peyton Manning and Drew Brees and Tom Brady do. But it's different. They are great at what they do; I love to watch them, but Mike takes your breath away. \"You watch him and you say, 'How did he get away from that guy; how did he make that deep throw; how did he throw across his body like that?' \" By all accounts, Vick has dedicated himself to the craft of his position as never before. In interviews now, he sounds markedly more clear-headed than during his Atlanta days. He has struck all the right notes thus far this season, including dedicating himself to regular appearances on behalf of the anti-dog fighting campaign of the Humane Society of the United States. That cause has benefited even from those wishing Vick ill. A pair of Green Bay fans this season pledged $10 to the Humane Society for every time the quarterback was sacked. The total currently stands at $340. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told the Philadelphia Inquirer, \"This young man has turned his life around, and he's going to contribute.\" While Vick never can outrun his past, there are signs that he has begun to at least give it a good race. Nowhere has the Vick conversation been more divisive than in Atlanta, where he was the franchise's No. 1 overall draft pick in 2001. His rise lifted the Falcons profile nationally and titillated the fan base like no other player, including Deion Sanders. And his fall absolutely laid waste to the franchise for two seasons. Chris Dimino, co-host of morning sports talk on Atlanta's 790 The Fan, has found himself moderating the debate over Vick's standing among Falcons fans. It often swings between vitriol and blind adoration, seeming to break down frequently along racial lines. \"I never thought I'd see the light at the end of that tunnel. But I do sense that there is a turn (in the tone of the conversation),\" Dimino said. \"Most people now are playing the good-for-him, give-him-a-second-chance card,\" he added. \"He was stupidity personified. He paid the price; now let's move on. People like a redemption story. \"Of course, if the Falcons weren't 13-3 now, there might be a heck of a lot more venom than there is now.\" Vick's past and present teams may be on a collision course for an NFC Championship game meeting in Atlanta, at which time the old scab will be ripped clean off. Deciding on how to deal with Vick here at center stage would be so much easier if only there were a porthole to his soul, allowing a peek at what's really in there. How can any fan know? Vick's road to fan acceptance is the same one that will take him to a new contract; his two-year deal (which with bonuses and incentives have earned him a reported $7 million) runs out this season. He seems to realize the practical truth that what he does is going to amount to much more than what he utters. He recently told Sports Illustrated, \"I don't think me saying the right thing is going to get me a new deal. It's all about my play. It's all about how you conduct yourself as you play well. I don't have to put on a front around anybody.\" The idea that people can change -- that's the notion Wayne Pacelle's life is built around. \"If it was my belief that people were static, I don't think I could come to work every day,\" says the president and CEO of the Humane Society of the United States. Vick is just one of a number of former dog fighters and animal abusers that Pacelle's group has enlisted as spokesmen against cruelty. Vick has made a dozen appearances in major cities in the East, attempting to reach youngsters who could be lured into the practice of pitting dogs against each other in back alleys and abandoned buildings, so-called \"street fighting.\" Pacelle said he has been asked a thousand times whether he believes Vick is sincere. Asked for the 1,001st time, he said, \"I don't get into that.\" All he knows for sure is that he has seen Vick speak to hundreds of youngsters who, because of the quarterback's status, \"sit and listen in rapt attention.\" Will the head of the Humane Society be rooting for the one-time dog fighter this weekend? Pacelle is one of the very few who remain mute on that subject.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Medical tourism is one of the hottest topics in health care as patients around the world are increasingly traveling abroad for treatment. Wockhardt Hospitals in India actively target international patients. Josef Woodman, author of Patients Beyond Borders, a guide to medical tourism, told CNN that two to three million people travel outside their home country for treatment each year, while consultancy firm Deloitte calculates that 750,000 Americans traveled abroad for treatment last year. The top regional destination for medical tourists is Asia, with Singapore, Thailand and India leading the way. Those countries are home to private health care chains that target international patients and are building modern, high-tech hospitals with a reputation for quality care.  See more medical tourism hotspots Â» . Bumrungrad International Limited (BIL), based in Thailand, owns and operates over 70 health care facilities in seven countries. According to BIL, its Bangkok flagship hospital treats over 400,000 foreign patients a year, with over 90,000 coming from the Middle East. Parkway Health, a Singaporean hospital chain, says the city of Singapore attracted approximately 450,000 international patients last year, and in India, the Apollo Hospitals Group says it has treated more than 60,000 foreign patients in the last five years. What these chains have in common is that at least some of their hospitals are accredited by Joint Commission International (JCI), the global arm of an American nonprofit organization that accredits most U.S. hospitals. That provides overseas patients with the assurance that their treatment will be of an internationally recognized standard. Dr. Ajaya Jha, director of neuroscience at Max Hospital in New Delhi, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta that medical tourism to India was being driven by a lack of available health care in neighboring countries, and by the lower cost of treatment in India compared with developed countries. \"Slowly we're developing a reputation for having the best technology in the world and some of best people in the world to do this,\" said Jha. For uninsured or underinsured Americans, low prices make treatment in Asia an attractive option. Surgery in Thailand and Latin America can cost a quarter of its U.S. price, and JCI-accredited Wockhardt Hospitals offer open heart surgery in India for $8,500, compared to around $100,000 in the U.S. and $28,000 in the UK. In countries with state-run health services, such as Britain and Canada, long waiting times for surgery are encouraging patients to look overseas for a cheaper alternative to private treatment in their own country. Would you travel abroad for medical treatment? Share your views in the SoundOff below . But contrary to the popular view of patients traveling from wealthy nations to developing countries for cheap medical care, a recent survey by consultancy firm McKinsey found that most medical tourists travel in search of advanced medical technologies or to receive better care than they would at home. Woodman says 250,000 Indonesians are treated in Singapore each year, while Cambodian and Vietnamese resident choose Thailand for treatment and patients from the Middle East favor Singapore and Thailand. While medical tourism is targeted as a growth industry in some developing countries, there is concern that it will result in a \"brain drain,\" where doctors migrate from public hospitals to private hospitals that cater to international patients. South Korea recently limited foreign patients to no more than five percent of its hospital beds, to ensure domestic patients do not lose out. Woodman says the \"brain drain\" isn't an issue in India, because there are so many talented surgeons and physicians there in the public and private sector. He adds that developing countries can benefit from medical tourism. \"The presence of medical tourism brings a lot of economic clout into a country and raises the bar by forcing at least certain hospitals to rise to the top standards of healthcare,\" he told CNN. While the bulk of medical tourism is for private care, there is a move towards a kind of state-funded medical tourism within the EU. Rulings by the European Court of Justice in recent years have verified the right of all EU citizens to receive healthcare in another member state, paid for by their own country's health system. Diane Dawson, a senior research fellow at the Center for Health Economics at York University, England, told CNN that patients can only take advantage of this if their own country cannot provide treatment without \"undue delay.\" That limitation, as well as the difficulty in getting authorization from their own national health system, means that relatively few patients currently travel within the EU for treatment, she said. But an EU draft directive published last year aims to make the approval process easier and more transparent. Keith Pollard, director of British Web site Treatment Abroad, told CNN that the new directive will mean patients will be able to receive treatment abroad regardless of waiting times in their own country. But patients will only be reimbursed up to the amount their treatment costs in their home country and they will probably still require some degree of approval from their own health system. Pollard says that while he doesn't foresee a boom in medical tourism within the EU, he believes the new legislation will encourage patients to seek treatment abroad and help create a European health care market.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- President Barack Obama arrives in Mumbai Saturday morning for three days of deal making, cultural engagements and talks on regional and global security. He and Manmohan Singh, the Indian prime minister, have much to discuss. America is the world's most powerful democracy; India is its largest and most vibrant. America needs India to stabilize a rough neighborhood; India needs America to counter China's growing power. America wants to develop a strategic military alliance by arming India with the modern tools of war; New Delhi prefers a more limited transactional relationship with Washington to replace its depleted Soviet-era fleet that avoids making India the operating base of a future conflict. America wants less outsourcing and more trade to create badly needed new jobs at home; India, whose protectionist economic tendencies have given way to a meritocracy driven by entrepreneurial spirit, wants more U.S. visas to train its bright minds and can't understand why American innovation has given way to a defeatist closed-door, anti-immigration mentality. President Obama's electoral defeat in Tuesday's midterm elections assures domestic gridlock for the remainder of his first term in office. Prime Minister Singh's government -- racked by corruption and a bloated bureaucracy -- has shown little interest in executing the reform mandate it was elected to undertake last year. Roads have not been built. Taxes have not been streamlined or collected. Health care is no better. A hallmark nuclear pact reached with Washington in 2005 to make India energy self-sufficient threatens to be derailed five years on by reactionary legislation introduced in Singh's own party. Kashmiri separatists riot in the north. Maoist rebels surge in the east. India, Singh must think to himself at times, is nearly ungovernable. Yet crippled domestic agendas offer both men an opportunity to lead in foreign policy. Obama must strike a grand bargain with Singh that commits both leaders to take steps that create an open-architecture security environment for South Asia. Intelligence needs to be gathered, analyzed and shared communally to combat threats facing the entire region, not just any one country within it, so the landscape for economic revitalization and political reconciliation improves. India, President Obama should tell his hosts, must now assume the responsibilities imposed upon it by its growing political stature and economic power. Pakistan, the epicenter of Islamist extremism, is the obvious place to start. Singh refuses to engage Pakistan beyond superficial matters because he argues, with cause, that whatever is left of his political clout would evaporate if one more Mumbai-style terror attack was launched from Pakistani soil. As Hamas often did during the course of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations, South Asia's terror groups would surely attack at any sign of rapprochement between Islamabad and New Delhi. What are peacemakers to do? Obama must offer to bridge the trust gap that keeps India and Pakistan apart on security, economic and political issues. He should start by asking his military commanders to bring Indian and Pakistani army and intelligence chiefs together in secret at a neutral location (Geneva, Switzerland; Oslo, Norway; or Stockholm, Sweden) so they can reformulate conditions for sharing critical intelligence. The countries' former intelligence chiefs, Chander D. Sahay of India and Gen. Ehsan ul Haq of Pakistan, did just that from 2003 until 2005 with stunningly effective results. Afghan military and intelligence officials could join in after the primary Indo-Pakistani relationship is framed. Through such cooperation, India might find grounds for taking Pakistan into confidence on its operations to stabilize Afghanistan's economy and to assist in rebuilding its domestic police and paramilitary forces, allaying Pakistani army enmity and fears of an east-west squeeze play on their borders by New Delhi. Pakistan could commit, in return, to close down or starve from an operational standpoint camps that support the Haqqani terrorist network in northern Waziristan, from which many who would attack India are trained and ideologically nurtured. India might also get significant, albeit nonpublic, assistance from Pakistan to douse the flames of revolt in Kashmir by encouraging Pakistan-backed separatist leaders to engage with New Delhi in dialogue -- at a minimum, fewer people would then die. Done correctly, such earnest dialogue could form the basis for a long-term peace contract in the Himalayan enclave. Obama could then offer U.S. support for India's permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council if India demonstrated it was ready to play a major regional role as economic big brother to lesser economies, starting with a trade pact for Pakistan. Jobs to employ today's extremists in Pakistan through bilateral trade would reduce tomorrow's pool of would-be bombers who could threaten Indian centers of commerce. To incent Pakistan to open up, Obama could ask his friends in the U.S.-India Caucus to lobby for congressional passage of textile tariff relief for Pakistan that fuels growth in an industry critical to India-Pakistan trade: Indian-Americans helping Pakistani trade get off the ground -- detente indeed. Finally, Obama could lean on his Indian host to invite Pakistan's president over for a summit. Asif Ali Zardari, inept and ineffective as he might seem to outsiders, is perhaps in greater control of Pakistan's political machinery than most give him credit for. And while Pakistan's generals despise what they consider his corrupt ways, Zardari's commercial instincts will serve him well in using trade as a cornerstone for peace with his eastern neighbors. If Singh reaches across the divide and offers a political breakthrough that gives Zardari a face-saving reason to say \"yes\" to peace, he might be surprised at how fast the Pakistani leader accepts the chance to rise above the politics of distrust and dissension and engage in making peace across the array of issues that divide both nations. India must learn, as America did long ago, that with power comes responsibility to take care of those less fortunate around it. In a region where ultra-power (China) and ultra-poverty (Afghanistan) co-exist, India must take advantage of America's experience and its energetic president to bring peace and prosperity to the region in a manner befitting its rising global stature. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mansoor Ijaz.",

    "input": "ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Pakistan will hold parliamentary elections Monday, with political parties competing for 272 seats in the National Assembly. Election posters jostle for space on a street in Rawalpindi ahead of Pakistan's elections on Monday. The elections were due to take place in December of last year but were postponed after the assassination of Pakistan People's Party chairman, Benazir Bhutto. In 2008, 49 political parties applied for poll symbols with the Election Commission. Outlined below are the main contenders: . PPP . The assassination of leader Benazir Bhutto looms large over the PPP, which had been banking on the charismatic leader to rally supporters to its cause and shake off the charges of corruption that have dogged the party since Bhutto fled prosecution after two terms as prime minister. The fortunes of the party, launched in 1967 by her father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, remains in the hands of her family, with son Bilwal installed as chairman. Founded on promises of \"egalitarian democracy,\" the PPP flirted with socialist principles in its early days, gaining a mass popularity that continues to ensure it is among Pakistan's largest political parties. While the PPP has lost touch with its socialist roots, it remains popular among Pakistan's oppressed and underprivileged, particularly in the southern province of Sindh, from where the Bhutto family hails. PML-N . The PML-N is the largest faction of the Pakistan Muslim League and is led by Nawaz Sharif, who has re-emerged as a political player in Pakistan in the past few months after returning from Saudi Arabia where he was exiled after being ousted from power in a 1999 coup led by Pervez Musharraf. The centrist conservative party was in power twice in the 90s, with both terms ending amid damaging allegations of corruption, despite campaigning on an anti-graft platform. Sharif's 1997 victory was the largest mandate every recorded in Pakistan, but was immediately called into question by his opponent Bhutto. The term ended in chaos as . PML-N under Sharif received a huge public mandate in 1997 and formed a government with two-thirds majority. Though his rule was credited with economic growth it was cut short when complaints of corruption and an attempt to replace the head of the military backfired when newly-installed army chief Musharraf led a successful coup, forcing him into exile to avoid corruption convictions. Permitted by Musharraf to return to Pakistan last year, Sharif is now banking  the PML-N's fortunes on a platform of renewing the country's top judiciary -- removed by Musharraf during a state of emergency. PML-Q . Formed under guidance from Musharraf in 2001, the PML-Q was originally a splinter faction of the Pakistan Muslim League, which was able to attract enough dissidents from the PML-N to cobble together an alliance and form a government in 2002. The largely center-conservative party has seen its power base dented through its association with Musharraf as polls show the president's falling popularity in the face of the resurgent PPP and PML-N. MMA . Formed after Musharraf allied himself to the U.S.-led anti-terror coalition in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attack on New York and Washington, the MMA is a coalition of six Islamic parties that emerged as a powerful challenger to the president. Opponents have decried the MMA, or Muttahida Majlis Amal's goal of establishing a theocracy in Pakistan, and its attempts to impose hardline sharia law in the impoverished areas where it exerts greatest control. The resolutely anti-American alliance, dominated by JI (Jamaat I Islami) and JUI-F (Jamiat Ulema Islam) saw success in the 2002 elections in the North West Frontier and Balochistan provinces and went on to form a provincial government in the NWFP and a coalition government in Balochistan. Its prospects are likely to be hampered by a dispute within the alliance over whether to boycott the parliamentary elections. MQM . The MQM stands for the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a party formed to protect the rights of the Urdu-speaking immigrants from India after Partition. Led by Altaf Hussain from his self-imposed exile in the UK, the party has been supportive of Musharraf's policies and formed part of the PML-Q alliance. Frequently facing allegations of involvement in terrorist activities, the party's recent efforts to extend its support base to other provinces have yielded little success. ANP . The Awami National Party is a nationalist leftist party based in the North West Frontier province that and enjoys widespread popularity with ethnic Pakhtuns. The ANP did not enjoy much success in 2002 but has renewed hopes as the MMA's following fades in the Frontier. PTI . Pakistan Tehrik I Insaf is headed by the cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan. Vitriolic in his criticism of Musharraf's policies, Khan has failed to capitalize on his popularity as a sportsman, seeing his party take just one seat in the 2002 elections. PTI has said it will boycott the 2008 elections.  E-mail to a friend .",

Nan Cooper, a job seeker, said applicants have to do more these days than just walk into a prospective employer's office with a resume. \"[Times] have changed radically,\" she told KMGH in Denver. \"I've spent countless, countless hours on the Internet and filling out applications.\"  iReport.com: Share your job hunt story . She said she had even applied for jobs through the online auction site eBay. Read the full report on KMGH . Northeast: Job week seeks to solve 'disconnect' between employers, job hunters . Employers in the Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area say they are having a difficult time filling 22,000 available positions. Mayor Luke Ravenstahl said this week the city would increase its participation in a job placement program, both monetarily and through city organizations. The mayor made his remarks as part of a kickoff event for Imagine Career Week, which links high school students and employers. A spokesman for one of the groups sponsoring the week's events said there shouldn't be so many employers with open spots. \"At the same time, we have young people walking around famously saying that they can't find a job. There's a big disconnect there someplace,\" Paul Leger of the Allegheny Conference told WTAE. During the career week, students will visit businesses and prospective employers will visit classrooms.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Last August, then-Republican presidential nominee John McCain introduced to the nation his surprise pick for vice president, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin has a strong base of supporters, as well as a steady supply of vocal critics. At the time, little was known about the fresh-faced, first-term governor, but within days, Palin's face was on newspapers, magazines and tabloids. Since then, Palin has become a polarizing figure in the Republican Party. Her passionate supporters are countered with equally fervent critics. And even though it's been nearly a year since she ventured onto the national stage and more than eight months since the Republican ticket lost the election, as Palin prepares to leave office, the public's interest in her has yet to wane. Palin explains why she's stepping down . \"She's kind of a shooting star that caught fire and kept burning,\" said Lorenzo Benet, an assistant editor for People magazine and author of \"Trailblazer: An Intimate Biography of Sarah Palin.\" \"When she walks into a room, she definitely commands attention and she gets more than most. She's definitely a star,\" said Benet, who was the only national journalist to have spent much time with Palin in the weeks before she was announced as McCain's running mate. Palin, a mother of five, \"caught the imagination\" of the public because there is no one else like her, Benet said. \"Particularly for conservative America, there hasn't been a rallying figure of this type,\" he noted. In the days leading up to Palin's debut speech at the Republican National Convention last September, Palin revealed that her 17-year-old daughter Bristol was pregnant. The announcement followed Internet rumors that Sarah Palin's 4-month-old baby was actually Bristol's. The instant fascination with Palin and her family was just a glimpse of what was to come. The public wanted to know everything it could about the Alaska governor, whose resume also included beauty queen, high school basketball star, TV sportcaster and mayor of the small Alaska town of Wasilla. Amid all the rumors and negative press, Palin showed herself to be a fierce attack dog and came out throwing punches in her speech at the RNC. The self-described \"hockey mom\" tore into then-candidate Barack Obama as two-faced, inexperienced and intoxicated by the sound of his own voice. Even her critics recognized the spirit she brought to the GOP. Palin continued to throw flames on the campaign trail, energizing her supporters and outraging her adversaries. \"She yelled fire in a crowded theater. She really did, in some of her speeches --'palling around' with terrorists and some of the other slurs she was hurling in the way of Obama and the Democrats,\" said Larry Persily, a former Palin staffer and Alaskan journalist. \"That turned off an equally big chunk of the American public that found it distasteful, destructive, divisive, mean and ignorant. Whereas others said, 'Way to go girl. You stick it to them,\" he said. But Palin hasn't always been such a divisive figure. Before entering the national scene, Palin, who knocked out incumbent Republican Frank Murkowski in the gubernatorial primary, was touted as one of the most popular governors in the country, with approval ratings nearing 90 percent. She was seen as a champion of ethics, determined to root out corruption and challenge the status quo. For those in Alaska, Palin's Reaganesque appeal was nothing new. She secured her role as a local hero back in 1982 when she led Wasilla High School's basketball team to a state championship. And in a small community like Wasilla, that was a big deal. Alaskans liked her \"combativeness and feistiness,\" Benet said, and resurrected her nickname of \"Barracuda\" during her successful 1996 campaign to be Wasilla's mayor. But when Palin's \"Barracuda\" side hit the national stage, it was met with mixed reactions. Evangelia Souris, the president of Optimum International Center for Image Management, says Palin's potential is the driving force behind the public's love-hate relationship with her. \"That's what people are drawn to, and that's what actually threatens others. She definitely has the power to shake up a lot of old-school institutions.\" said Souris, who has advised politicians. Furthermore, Souris said, \"I just don't think people were ready for somebody so attractive and so fashionable and so hip to actually be campaigning. She falls out of the norm,\" Souris added. But despite grumblings from some that they're sick of hearing about her, stories about her continue to get a lot of attention. Benet said People magazine follows two politicians: \"One is Obama, and one is Sarah Palin -- and then there's everybody else.\" From being dogged by ethics complaints, to her public fight with Levi Johnston (the father of her grandson and ex-fiance of her daughter), to her recent announcement that she's resigning this week as governor, Palin has maintained a steady presence in the public eye since stepping off the campaign trail. Michael Carey, a columnist with the Anchorage Daily News, says Palin stirs excitement -- and hostility -- because \"people want to see her even if they don't like her.\" He likens the public's interest with her to \"drinking on the sly.\" People say, \"I don't want to do this, I know I shouldn't, but I do it anyway,\" he said. Some people love Palin, Persily said, because they can relate to her. \"I think much of America said, 'Oh gee look at her, she's just like us. Kind of dumb on some things, kind of smart on others. Imperfect. And not at all embarrassed to show all of her imperfections.'\" But others saw her imperfections as inadequacies. \"She's simplistic. Some people love the simplistic approach to problems. Others shake their heads and say, 'My God, you don't get it.'\" Persily added. Opponents have been quick to question Palin's intellectual chops, pointing to her spotty college career. Palin attended five colleges, graduating from the University of Idaho with a communications degree in 1987. A series of botched national interviews didn't do much to disprove their point. But even Palin's critics admire her ability to connect with the people, Benet said. \"I don't think I've ever really met anyone like that, except maybe Bill Clinton, that will have that interpersonal eye contact with you and will remember your name and your kids' names, and make small talk with you and be really sincere about it,\" he said. Benet predicted that while Palin might take a short break to recoup once she hands off power on Sunday, \"she'll be back in the public eye.\" \"I do see her turning this to her advantage,\" he said, noting that she's made a similar move before. In 2004, Palin stepped down as chair of the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission after less than a year on the job, amid controversy over ethics allegations against another committee member. She turned that move around and used it as a launchpad to run for governor, because she went after the corruption going on in Alaska at the time. \"For me, I think she's just catching her breath. She's just too young to retire,\" he added. \"She did say 10 years ago she wanted to be president some day. She hasn't backed off from that.\" In Carey's opinion, Palin's career as an elected official is over, but he doesn't expect Palin to be leaving the headlines anytime soon. \"She's gone from being our governor or a public figure in Alaska to being a national celebrity,\" he said. \"It's clear that her days of governor -- there are just a few of them left, but she's really only at the beginning of her career as a celebrity.\"",

    "input": "Los Angeles (CNN) -- As the world was grieving and looking for answers in the death of Whitney Houston, Houston's 18-year-old daughter, Bobbi Kristina, was taken to a Los Angeles hospital, police said. Beverly Hills police said Sunday the teen was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center at about 11:15 a.m. She was released later Sunday and was expected to head to New Jersey, where her grandmother lives, as early as Sunday night, a source close to the family told CNN. Singer Kim Burrell, a family friend, told CNN on Sunday afternoon from the Grammy Awards' red carpet that she was with the teenager on Saturday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel after Houston died. This was a few hours after Burrell said she'd exchanged messages with her close friend, Houston, after she arrived in Los Angeles for the festivities. Whitney Houston's death sets somber tone for Grammys . \"As to be expected, she's overwhelmed -- it's her mother. She knows how much her mother meant to the world. And Bobbi Kristina has a huge heart, just like her mother,\" said Burrell, adding that that Bobbi Kristina affectionately refers to her as \"Auntie Kim.\" \"She loves hard,\" Burrell said of Bobbi Kristina. \"She's going to be OK, and we're going to see to it.\" Bobbi Kristina Brown was born in 1993, during Houston's marriage to R&B singer Bobby Brown, which ended in divorce in 2007. The daughter of music royalty became publicly known during the mid-2000s reality show \"Being Bobby Brown,\" where she frequently appeared alongside her parents and often had a front-row seat to their marital fireworks. Houston once said of her only child, \"She encourages me and inspires me. When I look at her eyes and I see myself, I go, 'Okay. I can do this. I can do this.'\" Mother and daughter even performed together on national TV in 2009, when the two sang \"My Love Is Your Love\" in Central Park on ABC's \"Good Morning America.\" Results from Houston autopsy could take weeks . Bobbi Kristina Brown proved she could do it on her own when she posted a video on Twitter of herself singing Adele's \"Someone Like You\" last September. So far the video has been viewed more than 100,000 times on YouTube. Bobbi Kristina Brown has previously given insight into her relationship with her mother, stating on Twitter, \"I love my family so much ... I'm so thankful for (my mother). Thank you so much lord for blessing me with an Phenomenal family and incredibly phenomenal mother.\" Less than 24 hours after Whitney Houston's death stunned fans and the entertainment world, her admirers became tearful and worried again Sunday upon hearing the news that Houston's daughter was taken to the hospital. \"Really, oh my gosh,\" said Trudy Hunchar, a flight attendant who was accompanied by her 12-year-old daughter, Quinn. On Sunday afternoon, the mom and daughter were paying their last respects to Houston outside the Beverly Hilton Hotel, where the 48-year-old singer died the day before. The parent and child came to the hotel to add a light-pink rose to a growing sidewalk memorial of flowers and candles created by fans. \"I'm just hoping it's anxiety or a panic attack or hurt,\" Hunchar said of the daughter's hospital visit. Then Hunchar expressed concern about the entertainment industry because the Denver family was visiting Los Angeles so that 12-year-old Quinn, an aspiring actress with a movie credit, could meet with an agent and manager about an acting career. \"With her coming into this business,\" Hunchar said, pointing to her daughter, \"I'll have a tough hand on her. She's got a strong head. She's pretty smart. This business is tough, and as best as I can, I'll have a hand on her.\" HLNtv.com's Jonathan Anker and CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.",

About 4,000 people were evacuated from the village of Ojen and an additional 2,000 people from the eastern part of Marbella, said Maria Jose Figueira, a spokeswoman for Marbella's government. The fire has been brought under control in Marbella but continues to rage out of control north of Marbella near Ojen and Coin, Figueira said. At least one person is feared dead after a charred body, thought to be that of an elderly man, was found in Ojen, she told CNN. An injured German couple has been admitted to the Carlos Haya Hospital in Malaga, she added. The wildfire started Thursday in Coin, to the north of Marbella, Figueira said. It was at its most intense at noon Friday near the villages of Ojen, Coin and Monda, Spain's Efe news agency reported. A racetrack in Marbella and a sports center in the Monda area have been set up as shelters for those forced to leave their homes, the news agency said. However, those previously ordered to leave their homes in Marbella can now return, Figueira said. The Costa del Sol, in Spain's Andalucia region, is popular with visitors for its Mediterranean beaches and sunshine, and is home to large numbers of expatriates, particularly from Britain. The UK Foreign Office said it was working with Spanish authorities. \"We estimate that several hundred British nationals have been evacuated, including some 300 who have been relocated to evacuation centers in the La Cala de Mijas and Calahonda areas,\" a Foreign Office spokeswoman said. Marbella, studded with luxurious villas, is known as a destination for the rich and famous.

    "input": "Editor's note: Ralph J. Begleiter teaches communication, journalism and political science at the University of Delaware. During two decades as CNN's \"world affairs correspondent,\" Begleiter was the network's most widely traveled reporter. Ralph J. Begleiter says the Pentagon's new policy on media access to coffins of war dead is a milestone. NEWARK, Delaware (CNN) -- The reversal of two decades of policy on images of returning war casualties is an important and welcome milestone for the American people. The Pentagon's decision announced Thursday allowing media coverage of coffins of war victims returning to Dover Air Force Base -- if families agree -- restores to its rightful, honorable place the immense value of the sacrifice American troops make on behalf of their nation. It allows the American people to honor the dignified and respectful return of war casualties to home soil for the last time. Although no one should have a veto over the nation's ability to pay respects to its fallen troops, I believe most families will decide that their sons and daughters deserve to be recognized publicly for their sacrifice. These men and women enlisted in the military for their nation. They fought for their nation. They died for their nation. Their return should be respectfully and publicly acknowledged by their nation. The ban on images of returning casualties started accidentally, and without any reference to the \"privacy\" of the families of those who gave their lives in service to the nation. The accident of media history occurred in December 1989 when poor White House scheduling placed President George H.W. Bush before live television cameras just as the first American casualties were arriving at Dover Air Force Base from the U.S. invasion of Panama. CNN and two other major TV networks fired up their split-screen technology, showing on one side the president joking with White House reporters just before the Christmas holiday -- and on the other the sober images of flag-draped military caskets being carried ceremoniously by honor guards across the tarmac at Dover. After the holidays, the president appealed publicly to reporters to \"help me\" overcome a public impression that he had been insensitive on TV about the returning casualties. News media had been covering the return of war casualties since World War II. Some military personnel believe the showing of those images -- and others from the jungles of Vietnam -- contributed to a gradual growth of anti-war sentiment during the 1960s. Just days before the Gulf War began in January 1991, the new media policy was formalized in a cable sent by the Defense Department to its posts: There would be no media coverage of returning casualties at Dover or other stops along the way home. The directive made no mention of anyone's privacy but portrayed the ban on coverage of returning casualties as an effort to ease pressure on stressed families, who might feel obliged to travel to Dover to witness the return of their loved one with news media watching. Over the next decade, several exceptions were made to the ban on media coverage at Dover, including for the return of Navy personnel killed in the bombing of the USS Cole off Yemen's coast, just weeks before the election that brought the second President Bush into office. Ironically, throughout the ban on media coverage of returning casualties, the Pentagon continued documenting this important part of any war by assigning military and government contract photographers to take pictures of the flag-draped caskets. Those images, among the most poignant, respectful and dignified tributes to troops who died in service of their nation, were carefully maintained by the Defense Department. They were used for training of honor guards and for commemorating the significance of war casualties. Although taken by the government, those images were withheld from public view. From the aftermath of September 11, 2001, through the invasion of Iraq in March 2003, the Pentagon kept taking those pictures even as it expanded its ban on media coverage of returning casualties -- now arguing that such war images would somehow invade the privacy of families of the deceased troops. It was those images that a series of Freedom of Information Act requests pried loose in 2005 after months of legal skirmishing. (Those requests were initiated by Russ Kick, editor of a Web site called \"The Memory Hole.\" When the Pentagon refused to respond substantively to my own series of Freedom of Information Act requests, the National Security Archive at George Washington University and I took the government to court with a lawsuit over the images.) Just weeks before a federal judge was expected to rule in the case, the Pentagon pre-empted a precedent-setting order by releasing voluntarily more than 700 images of returning casualties. They remain to this day available to the public on the National Security Archive Web site. At the time Kick and I were seeking to make the Pentagon's pictures public, major U.S. news organizations were busy suiting up to cover the invasion of Iraq; they did not engage their lawyers to ask for access to Dover to witness the return of those who sacrificed their lives in the war and they have declined to do so since then. The Pentagon policy, which had come into being over the embarrassment of a president, evolved after the U.S. invasion of Iraq, into a complete ban preventing the American people from seeing the most important single measure of the cost of war. So desperate, apparently, was the White House desire to block public view of such images that military photographers at Dover were ordered to stop documenting the returns. To my knowledge, since 2005, no further photos have been taken showing those emotional moments when a casualty touches home soil for the last time. The Obama administration's reversal of two decades of policy on the visibility of returning casualties should have two immediate effects: . Public opinion -- consistently supportive of making the war casualty images public -- has reached a new high. Most recently, a CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday reported that 67 percent of those questioned said they think the government should allow the public to see photos of caskets of U.S. troops at an Air Force base. I have had the privilege of speaking with a number of family members who have lost loved ones in Afghanistan or Iraq. Most think the pictures should be public, but only after families authorize it. This dramatic change in government policy should once again allow all Americans to see the full human cost of war, while paying respect to those who served their nation as well as to their families. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ralph J. Begleiter.",

President Obama has said the U.S. combat mission in Iraq will end by August 31, 2010.

    "input": "BEIRUT, Lebanon (CNN) -- A car bomb struck a U.S. Embassy vehicle Tuesday as it traveled along a coastal highway north of Beirut, killing at least three Lebanese civilian bystanders, according to American and Lebanese officials. Lebanese soldiers and Red Cross workers stand near charred cars at the site of the explosion in Beirut. The driver of the embassy vehicle suffered minor injuries, and the sole passenger walked away unscathed, U.S. State Department spokesman Sean McCormack said. Both were Lebanese nationals, he said. An American citizen who happened to be in the area suffered non-life-threatening injuries, the spokesman said. Lebanese internal security forces said three Lebanese civilian bystanders were killed in the explosion in Beirut's Dora area, contradicting earlier reports of four. Twenty-one others -- including the American bystander -- were wounded in the explosion, which was caused by a 15-kilogram (33-pound) bomb placed in a car before the explosion, the security forces said. The United States is outraged by the terrorist attack, said Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who is traveling with President Bush in Saudi Arabia. \"I want on behalf of our country to say to those who were wounded, and certainly to the families of those who were killed, that our condolences are with them,\" she added. It was not clear whether the blast was caused by a suicide attack or by a remotely detonated car bomb. A communique issued by the U.S. Embassy in Beirut said the embassy vehicle was apparently the intended target of the attack, and identified the driver and passenger as Lebanese security personnel for the embassy. But McCormack cautioned against jumping to any conclusions on the intended target. \"We don't yet have a full picture of exactly what happened, who is responsible, who is exactly being targeted,\" he told reporters during the State Department's daily briefing. \"We will see over the next day or two ... where the facts lead us.\" Citing security concerns, McCormack would also not address unconfirmed reports that the vehicle was part of a convoy for departing U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon Jeffrey Feltman. A U.S. Embassy statement said Feltman canceled a farewell ceremony that he was to host Tuesday night \"out of respect to the victims of today's terrorist explosion.\" In addition to the American, an Iraqi and at least three Lebanese were among those wounded in the blast, according to a Western diplomatic source. Video of the scene showed several damaged cars, including at least one that was left a pile of twisted metal. A nearby high-rise building also sustained damage. Mohammed Chatah, senior adviser to Lebanese Prime Minister Fouad Siniora, pointed out that the attack happened during \"a major political crisis\" in Lebanon, which has been without a president for nearly eight weeks amid a bitter political feud. \"This explosion just exacerbates a difficult situation,\" Chatah told CNN. Tuesday's blast appears to be the latest in a series of attacks against pro-Western, anti-Syrian targets in the Lebanese capital. Most recently, an explosion in Beirut's Christian suburb of Baabda killed Brig. Gen. Francois Al-Hajj, the head of operations for the Lebanese army, and his bodyguard on December 12. Al-Hajj was believed to be a top candidate to take over as army commander in the event current commander Gen. Michel Suleiman was elected to replace Emile Lahoud as president. Lebanon has been in the midst of a political crisis as pro- and anti-Syrian lawmakers in parliament are locked in a battle to elect a new president. The nation has been without a president since November 23, when the pro-Syrian Lahoud stepped down at the end of his term. In February 2005, the assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri in Beirut sparked widespread protests that led to the ouster of Syrian forces from Lebanon. E-mail to a friend .

Seven police jurisdiction were called in to quell the fighting. \"When (first responding) officers arrived there it was a pretty intense fight going on inside,\" Elmwood Place Police Chief William Peskin said. \"They actually had to wait until they got back-up there in order to make entry because there were so many people throwing bottles and chairs, so they had to actually wait.\" Police said the hall the was being rented out and the fraternal organization's membership was not involved. \"We got caught up in a family feud,\" Eagles member David Frost told CNN on Tuesday night, referring to the group that rented the Eagles' hall for the party. \"We're embarrassed by this.\" Members cleaned up the shards of glass and damaged chairs and a table Tuesday, said Frost, adding that his organization may revisit its policies on rentals. The party organizers brought their own alcohol, he said. \"I hate to see anybody get hurt,\" Frost added. The fight apparently broke out between the birthday girl's father and her mother's boyfriend, police said. Police charged the girl's 26-yaer-old father with disorderly conduct, WCPO said. Four others possibly face charges in the fracas. Fifteen people were injured in the melee, with at least five hospitalized, including one person who required surgery to the eye due to a cut from a beer bottle, police said. Police told WCPO beer bottles were the primary weapons used in the bloody melee. One person in the back threw as many bottles as he could find, Peskin said. A total of 20 officers responded to the scene, where about 30 children were in attendance. CNN's Phil Gast contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The coffin of former Czech President Vaclav Havel went on display in St. Anna's Church in central Prague Monday for people to pay their respects, the Czech News Agency reported. Havel died Sunday at the age of 75, and his funeral has been scheduled for Friday, the Czech president's office said. Admirers poured into the streets of Prague Sunday night with candles and flowers in memory of Havel, people on the scene said. The former dissident playwright helped topple communism in eastern Europe through the power of his words, insisting, \"Truth and love triumph over lies and hate.\" His longtime friend and translator Paul Wilson remembered him as a \"a very shy and gentle man with a will of steel, who was fearless when confronting a regime that tried, relentlessly, to crush his spirit.\" Havel, a puckish, absurdist playwright turned political activist, spent four and a half years in prison for opposing Czechslovakia's communist government before emerging as a leader of the Velvet Revolution that swept it aside in 1989. He went on to become president of Czechoslovakia and of the Czech Republic when the country split in two at the end of 1992. He died peacefully in his sleep Sunday morning in the presence of his wife, Dagmar, according to his spokeswoman Sabina Tancevova. A deeply serious thinker given to long, rambling statements in presidential speeches and conversation, Havel also had an impish sense of humor, reportedly whizzing through the long corridors of Prague Castle on a scooter after becoming president. It was his love of rock and roll as much as his moral outrage at the communist system that brought him to prominence. He co-wrote the influential Charter 77 anti-communist declaration in protest at the arrest of a Czechoslovak rock band, the Plastic People of the Universe. A perennial contender for the Nobel Peace Prize, Havel never won, but he remained active in anti-communist causes from Cuba to China until his death. He urged Chinese authorities to release dissident Liu Xiaobo, whose Charter 08 call for greater political freedom in China was inspired by Czechoslovakia's Charter 77. Havel and other Czech dissidents attempted to deliver a letter to the Chinese Embassy in January 2010, before Liu won the Nobel Peace Prize, but they found the doors closed and no one to receive it. It was an absurd scene that could have come out of one of the plays he wrote in the 1960s, poking fun at the Soviet-backed authorities who ruled his country at the time. Theater proved a potent weapon against Czechoslovakia's communist rulers, who stepped down without a shot being fired in the weeks after the Berlin Wall fell, signaling the defeat of the region's authoritarian Moscow-backed regimes. Havel was unanimously elected president by the last communist-run parliament of Czechoslovakia 22 years ago this month, and two months later delivered a speech to a historic joint session of the U.S. Congress. The trip to Washington as president of his country came less than four months after Havel was last arrested by the communist authorities, leading him to tell Congress dryly: \"It is all very extraordinary indeed.\" His country joined NATO and the European Union under his stewardship, but he lost out on many of the major domestic political battles of his presidency, including his effort to keep Czechoslovakia together. He resigned as president of Czechoslovakia after national politicians agreed to divide it in two, declaring, \"I will not be president of a self-liquidating nation.\" He went on to be elected president of the Czech Republic twice before writing one final play, \"Leaving,\" about a politician preparing to hand over power to a successor he despises -- widely considered one last dig at his perennial political opponent Vaclav Klaus, his successor as president. Klaus Sunday called Havel a \"symbol of our renewed nation.\" Havel spoke to CNN's Jim Clancy in March, reflecting on links between the Arab Spring and the fall of communism in eastern Europe. \"What is also sleeping under the surface and is invisible is a longing for certain elementary freedoms and that doesn't usually break out just like that, by itself,\" Havel said. \"The snowball is created, it's rolling and rolling and, very often, it turns into an avalanche.\" \"Like millions around the world, I was inspired by his words and leadership. ... Vaclav Havel was a friend to America and to all who strive for freedom and dignity, and his words will echo through the ages,\" U.S. President Barack Obama said in a statement. Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Havel as a \"dignified, charming, humble, determined man\" who \"suffered much in the cause of freedom and became one of its greatest heroes.\" But in his typically understated way, Havel expressed more modest wishes for how history would remember him. \"I would be glad if it was felt that I have done something generally useful,\" he said. \"I don't care much about personal fame or popularity. I would be satisfied with the feeling that I had a chance to help with something in general, something good. That history gave me that chance.\"",

Debris is cleared from the scene of Flight 3407's crash near Buffalo, New York, in February. Continental Connection Flight 3407, operated by regional carrier Colgan Air, plunged into a house in Clarence Center, New York, on the night of February 12, killing all 49 on board as well as one man in the house. In a story Monday, The Wall Street Journal cited investigators as saying the crash resulted from pilot Marvin Renslow's incorrect response to the plane's precarious drop in speed: He overrode an emergency system known as a \"stick pusher,\" which sends the plane into a dive so it can regain speed and avoid a stall. The Journal's report said Colgan had not provided Renslow with hands-on flight-simulator training for a stick-pusher emergency. Colgan, in rebuttal, issued a statement saying Renslow had received classroom instruction for such an emergency.  Watch a Colgan official respond to questions Â» . The company also emphasized that the Federal Aviation Administration does not require pilots to receive a stick-pusher demonstration in a flight simulator. \"The FAA generally trains to standards of routine line operations. They don't focus on the edges of the envelope,\" stall recovery expert Doug Moss told CNN. Colgan further admitted that during his career, Renslow failed five \"check rides\" -- occasional tests of pilot proficiency -- including two that Colgan said he did not disclose on his application with the airline. His most recent failed check ride occurred 16 months before the crash. \"In the cases while with Colgan, he received additional training and successfully passed the check rides,\" the airline said. Colgan stressed that despite his performance on check rides, Renslow nonetheless ultimately passed his pilot exams and had \"all the training and experience to safely operate the Q400,\" the airplane involved in the crash. Colgan further insisted that pilot fatigue was not a factor in the crash, noting that Renslow had \"nearly 22 consecutive hours of time off before he reported for duty on the day of the accident.\" In its statement, Colgan did not specifically address potential illness-related fatigue in 24-year-old co-pilot Rebecca Shaw, who, according to The Wall Street Journal report, said before takeoff that she probably should have called in sick. The National Transportation Safety Board begins a three-day hearing on the crash on Tuesday. Renslow's history as well as pilot training broadly will be examined.",

    "input": "HARARE, Zimbabwe (CNN) -- Zimbabwe's opposition party said four of its activists and the wife of Harare's mayor -- an opposition member -- have been killed by supporters of President Robert Mugabe, just days ahead of next week's presidential runoff. President Robert Mugabe says war veterans will take up arms again if Tsvangirai wins. Thursday's report came as U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice accused Mugabe of sponsoring efforts to starve, beat and kill supporters of his opponent Morgan Tzvangirai so he can win the election. Rice was speaking on the same day that Tendai Biti, the opposition Movement for Democratic Change's secretary-general, was charged with treason after being held in jail without charges for a week. If convicted, he could face the death penalty. His arrest and treason charges have been criticized by African and international leaders who characterize it as a ploy by Mugabe supporters to intimidate the opposition party before his June 27 runoff against Tsvangirai. A spokesman for the MDC blamed Mugabe's Zanu-PF party for the five most recent deaths, saying they brought to 70 the number of MDC party members killed since a bitterly contested election three months ago. The body of the mayor's wife, 27-year-old Abigail Chiroto, was found in a mortuary close to the couple's house north of Harare. She had been beaten so severely with rocks and iron bars that her face was almost unrecognizable, MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa said.  Watch CNN's Nkepile Mabuse report on the violience Â» . Chiroto was kidnapped, along with her 4-year-old son, on Tuesday. Some of her kidnappers wore military uniforms, Chamisa said. Chiroto's son was released unharmed. Her husband, Emmanuel Chiroto, is an MDC member who was recently elected mayor of Harare. He was not home at the time of the kidnapping. Also Thursday, the MDC said that four other activists were found dead in Chitungwiza. The victims' bodies showed evidence that \"they were heavily tortured until they died,\" an MDC statement said. \"It's unbelievable the way people are being killed or murdered,\" Chiroto said. \"It's almost mass butchering.\" Police confirmed the deaths of the activists but did not link the victims to any political party. Mugabe's party denied any part in the deaths, saying MDC officials made such accusations frequently. \"They are claiming anyone who dies. They phone CNN,\" said Bright Matonga, a Zanu-PF spokesman. \"Whenever someone dies in the hospital, they rush to claim them.\" Matonga said Harare was run by a commission. \"There is no MDC mayor in Zimbabwe,\" he said. \"There is no newly elected mayor in Harare.\"  Learn more about Zimbabwe Â» . In New York, Rice convened a meeting about the situation in Zimbabwe at the United Nations on Thursday. \"Mugabe is increasing violence against [the] opposition. ... President Mugabe has squandered the promise of the very nation that was hailed as the jewel of Africa,\" Rice said at a roundtable discussion attended by representatives from many international governments. \"Clearly we have reached a point where broader, stronger, international effort is needed,\" she added. On Friday, a magistrate judge will determine whether prosecutors have enough evidence to proceed with a trial against Biti. The judge also will determine whether Biti will be granted bail or will continue to be jailed until the trial. Biti was charged Thursday with treason, communicating false information prejudicial to the state, bringing the office of the president into disrepute and causing disaffection among armed forces, according to a journalist who was in the Harare courtroom. He denies all the charges.  Watch Biti arrive for his court hearing Â» . Biti, wearing a red jacket and looking exhausted, held his head in his hands as the proceedings took place in the packed courtroom. \"I think that one must express very serious objection to the manner in which this whole case is being handled,\" said Tsvangirai, who was in court. \"The accusations are frivolous.\" Three of the charges stem from a document titled \"The Transitional Strategy,\" which Biti is said to have written ahead of the March 29 election. Biti is denying that he wrote the document, and his lawyers described it as \"doctored.\" The fourth charge of communicating falsehoods alleges that Biti announced that Tsvangirai had won the March presidential election by an outright majority, meaning no runoff vote would be needed. In recent weeks, opposition groups and churches have reported numerous cases of kidnappings, torture and other violence in the country targeting opponents of Mugabe. Zanu-PF members have been suspected of being behind the acts. Zanu-PF claims that the MDC is behind the violence. It said MDC members attacked the mayor of Kadoma, a city 140 km (87 miles) southwest of Harare. It also accused MDC activists of causing millions of dollars damage to private business. Last week, Mugabe warned that veterans he commanded in his country's liberation war nearly three decades ago would take up arms again if Tsvangirai won.  Watch an ad vilifying Tsvangirai Â» . The MDC is using word of mouth and file-sharing sites such as YouTube to disseminate its campaign advertisements, claiming that they are banned by state media. The group sent advertisements to supporters via e-mail, asking them to forward them to their friends and relatives. \"Since the regime has denied the MDC access to state media, please send the adverts to as many people as you can,\" the e-mail says. \"A new Zimbabwe is near. The dictator is finished. Let's finish it!\" Mugabe has been Zimbabwe's only leader since the war ended in 1980 but is blamed for the economic collapse of a country once considered a regional breadbasket. Zimbabweans increasingly are unable to afford food and other essentials, with agriculture paralyzed by land reform and the world's highest rate of inflation. Police have arrested Tsvangirai several times in the weeks leading up to the runoff, most recently on Saturday, with 11 other officials and supporters from his party. South African President Thabo Mbeki met Mugabe and Tsvangirai on Wednesday in the hope of quelling tensions. Mbeki was visiting in his capacity as mediator with the 14-nation Southern African Development Community, the South African government said Wednesday. He is under domestic and international pressure for his perceived conciliatory stance toward Mugabe, but the South African leader recently said he would continue his quiet diplomacy despite recent events.

    "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- A handful of people rallied outside the Japanese Embassy on Saturday to show support for an American man who is jailed in Japan, accused of trying to kidnap his own children. Amy Savoie calls on Japan to release her husband during a rally outside the Japanese Embassy in Washington. During the demonstration, Christopher Savoie's wife, Amy, along with others from the Children's Rights Council of Japan -- a group that advocates visitation for both parents in divorce cases, and which organized Saturday's event -- called for Savoie's release. \"It makes me feel wonderful to know that these people are calling him a hero, saying he's brave, and I just hope he can come home and say thank you to all these people who've supported him,\" Amy Savoie told CNN. Christopher Savoie, 38, a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen, allegedly abducted his two children -- 8-year-old Isaac and 6-year-old Rebecca -- as his ex-wife walked them to school Monday in a rural town in southern Japan, police in Japan said. With the children, Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate in the city of Fukuoka to try to obtain passports for them, screaming at guards to let him in the compound. Savoie was steps away from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when Japanese police arrested him. Amy Savoie said the separation is taking a toll on her. \"I just wish I could talk to him, but I am forced to live with the fact that I can't talk to him. So I have to soothe myself and comfort myself with what he would say right now, and I just hope he's doing well,\" she said. Christopher Savoie and his first wife, Noriko Savoie, were married for 14 years before their divorce in January. The couple, both citizens of the United States and Japan, had lived in Japan but moved to the United States before the divorce. Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States. Christopher Savoie had visitation rights. During the summer, she fled with the children to Japan, according to court documents. A U.S. court than granted Christopher Savoie sole custody. Japanese law, however, recognizes Noriko Savoie as the primary custodian. The law there also follows a tradition of sole-custody divorces. When the couple splits, one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children. Complicating the matter further is the fact that the couple still are considered married in Japan because they never divorced there, police said Wednesday. And, police said, the children are Japanese and have Japanese passports. A 1980 Hague Convention standardized laws on international child abduction, but Japan is not a party to that agreement. If a child in Japan is taken against the wishes of the recognized Japanese parent, Japanese law considers the person who took the child an abductor. Christopher Savoie will be jailed for at least 10 days while Japanese prosecutors sort out details of the case.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Early in Michael Mann's vivid, incisive, but half-cocked gangster opus \"Public Enemies,\" Johnny Depp's John Dillinger returns to jail a few scant months after leaving it. Johnny Depp plays the charismatic John Dillinger in \"Public Enemies.\" Only this time he's just visiting -- and he's taking his friends out with him. It's an audacious opening gambit, and when the getaway gets messy -- one of the gang panics and soon bullets are flying all over the place -- we glimpse another insight into what makes Dillinger tick. As he clings to a wounded comrade for dear life, and stares death long in the face, he has to make a decision: What to do with the guy who panicked and brought this upon them? Dillinger lets him go. Based on Bryan Burrough's well-sourced account of the Depression-era crime wave that gave rise not only to Dillinger, but also to a whole gallery of criminal poster boys -- Machine Gun Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, the Barker gang, Bonnie and Clyde -- \"Public Enemies\" whittles the book down to its most dramatic duel: the nationwide manhunt for Dillinger presided over by J. Edgar Hoover (a knockout Billy Crudup) and led by his Chicago, Illinois, bureau chief, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale). Dillinger and Purvis assumed folk-hero proportions in their day. According to Burrough, when newsreels showed Dillinger -- public enemy No. 1 -- he was applauded more loudly than the president. A 20th-century Jesse James, he was an underdog with a reputation for fairness. It was said he never killed anybody, and he was gallant and jocular with members of the public, once offering his overcoat to a kidnapped bank teller he had taken as a human shield. The role is tailor-made for a self-styled rebel like Depp. He understands the outlaw's swagger, the ferocity that sits hand in glove with his soft-spoken sensitivity. All the romance in the picture comes from Depp: the graceful ease with which he vaults a bank railing, his astonishing self-confidence and his dedicated courtship of hat-check girl Billie Frechette (an eager Marion Cotillard). She's swept up less by the high life he promises than the passionate conviction of his pitch. Burrough paints Purvis as an ineffectual, even inept agent who was fortunate to be in the right place at the right time to nab Floyd, Nelson and Dillinger. The movie has no truck with such revisionism, but betrays little interest in Bale's dour, narrow lawman. The film's parallel cop-and-robber structure recalls Mann's modern classic, \"Heat.\" Purvis and Dillinger meet only once -- to talk -- and then face off just once more, at the climax, to kill and be killed. If the confrontation of Bale and Depp doesn't pack the same iconic punch as \"Heat's\" Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, the (entirely fictitious) exchange in a Midwestern jail cell remains central to the film. At one point, Dillinger reprimands Purvis for shooting down Pretty Boy Floyd, extending the poetic license still further -- as a point of historical fact Floyd died several months after Dillinger, and though Purvis was at the scene he almost certainly didn't pull the trigger. But Purvis did coordinate the execution of John Dillinger, an assassination as much as it was an attempted arrest, and maybe the nastiest crime in the picture. So when the incarcerated Depp advises the smug Bale that he should find a different line of work for his own peace of mind, his words carry a certain weight. Still, the movie's resolve to take Dillinger at face value feels a bit perfunctory, even old hat. At 140 minutes it takes a long time to find its rhythm; indeed, this is one film that would be better if it were 20 minutes longer. Still, there's little here that Arthur Penn didn't anticipate 40 years ago in \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" except maybe the intriguing idea that organized crime pulled the plug on the old-style go-it-alone bank robber in a belated attempt to forestall Hoover's dream of a federal law enforcement agency. For all its loving period detail, the movie scarcely notices the desperate poverty of the times. Shot largely on high definition video, \"Public Enemies\" doesn't look like the old gangster films -- it looks like TV. The images gain in immediacy what is lost in luster, but left this spectator looking for more texture, more depth -- more heat. iReport.com: Depp's best film? One of the new Hollywood's last great stylists, Mann is well aware of the sacrifice involved in this transition. You can see it in the loving way he pictures Johnny Depp's doomed Dillinger watching Clark Gable's doomed gangster embrace his fate in \"Manhattan Melodrama\" while Purvis and his deputies assume their places outside Chicago's Biograph Theater. There is something ritualistic about this sequence, as if Dillinger divines some measure of grace from the screen, and we congregants also play our part. The faces change, but it's the same old movie we remember.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Although most Swedes would be too modest to say so themselves, Stockholm can stake a decent claim to being the capital of Scandinavia. Built on 14 islands, Stockholm seems to float on water. Built on 14 islands where Lake MÃ¤laren meets the Baltic Sea, Stockholm is a soft-hued vision of light and water, the bewitching start to an archipelago of some 24,000 islands and islets. Sweden's neutrality during World War II means Stockholm was spared the bombing inflicted on most European capitals; the result is the unspoiled old town of Gamla Stan, with its winding, cobbled streets. Despite a post-war building blitz that saw the construction of some particularly uninspiring modernist architecture, it is a city where gray concrete facades are largely eschewed in favor of a smorgasbord of pastel colors, rusty reds and glowing ochres. For a capital city it's unusually green -- not just leafy and dotted with verdant parks, but environmentally sound. Stockholm proper has a population of just 800,000, avoiding the congestion and pollution that plague larger cities -- so much so that you can fish from, and swim in, the waters surrounding the city center. Cold and sometimes bleak during its long, dark winters, Stockholm comes alive during the summer, when the Scandinavian sun barely sets. As temperatures rise the city's cafe culture blossoms, only for Stockholm to become a ghost town during July, when the locals make the most of their generous holiday entitlement and slip off to holiday cottages in the archipelago. But beyond its historic heart Stockholm is a progressive, evolving city. Its financial fortunes grew with the mid '90s IT boom and shrank when the dotcom bubble burst, but it remains a hotbed of technology and communications companies. Watch ABBA's Bjorn Ulvaeus take CNN on a tour of Stockholm Â» . Around 20 percent of the residents of greater Stockholm are of foreign descent, giving a sense of cultural diversity -- not to mention some welcome variety to the city's thriving restaurant scene. Despite Sweden's largely anti-EU stance, Stockholm is cosmopolitan and outward looking, with a keen eye for the latest international trends. Its shops are filled with the latest in functional, minimalist Swedish design and there are enough boutiques boasting hip New York brands and cool Swedish labels to indulge Stockholmers' obsession with style. It's also the city where Swedish global exports H&M and IKEA have their flagship stores. For all its picture-postcard pleasantness and progressive civic planning, Stockholm can seem a little sterile. It's not the kind of place likely to be described as \"edgy.\" Stockholmers themselves can come across as standoffish, but that's not say that they are unfriendly -- just politely reserved. Small talk is regarded with a certain suspicion meaning the locals can be hard to get to know, but it's amazing what a difference a couple of glasses of akvavit can make. Puritan legal regulations mean that high-alcohol drinks (that's anything with more than 3.5 percent alcohol) are heavily taxed and can only be bought in bars and government-run \"Systembolaget\" shops. The result is that a night on the town is expensive enough to make anyone teetotal, with Stockholmers often avoiding midweek drinking, saving their krona for weekend partying. But what Stockholm lacks in grit it more than makes up for in style. From its artfully designed coffee shops to the classic contours of its baroque and rococo buildings, this island city is endlessly pleasing to behold, especially when viewed from the water that flows like blood through its veins.",

    "input": "HONG KONG, China (CNN) -- The United Nation's International Maritime Organization (IMO) has gathered this week in the shipping hub of Hong Kong to draw up new rules on ship recycling. Ship-breaking yards in Bangladesh are responsible for pollution and health problems. As the delegates meet in the city's Convention and Exhibition center overlooking the harbor, many of the vast container ships that glide past them will end up 1,500 miles away on the beaches of south east Bangladesh. India, Pakistan and Bangladesh take 80 percent of end-of-life ships, according to the NGO Platform on Shipbreaking, but critics of the U.N. convention being discussed fear the problems of pollution and poor working conditions these countries experience through badly regulated shipbreaking will not be properly addressed. Lee Adamson, the IMO's spokesperson, is confident the convention will be \"a tremendous step forward in terms of health and safety for workers in the industry and for protection of the environment from end-of-life ships. It will set standards where none previously existed.\" But those standards don't go far enough for lawyer and head of the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association, Rizwana Hasan. She has been trying to clean up the dirty and dangerous industry through the law courts since 2003. Her passion and persistence led to a Bangladesh High Court ruling in March this year finally forcing the government to tighten its regulations of the trade. It has also brought her the Goldman Environmental Prize in April and increasing international attention. \"Now I have an international connection, my opponents are taking me more seriously as a threat,\" she told CNN. The main objection of Hasan and the nongovernmental organization Platform on Shipbreaking against the IMO convention is that it fails to deal with the issue of pre-cleaning -- the removal of toxic materials from ships before they are beached and dismantled, which is often done by hand by laborers without any safety equipment. \"Technical details about recycling are being discussed, but nothing about pre-cleaning of ships. It's the core issue. Pre-cleaning is when the majority of in-built toxic material of a ship is removed before being beached in a foreign country. Plus, nothing is being said against beaching -- Bangladesh's beaches have become a natural disadvantage,\" Hasan told CNN. Secretary-General of the IMO Efthimios E. Mitropoulos stated in his opening address of conference its aim \"is to adopt a new convention on the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships, while balancing the commercial and economic considerations of the industry.\" With perhaps too much emphasis on the economic considerations of the industry, Hasan believes the IMO is in effect legalizing shipbreaking in the name of ship recycling. \"They're talking about the responsibility of the ship owners in building new ships, but not about the existing ships and what to do them,\" said Hasan. More ships to scrap . The ship breaking industry is booming. Single-hull oil tankers have to be taken off the high seas by 2010, but the financial downturn has also become a major factor. With less trade in goods, container ships are being taken out of service and scrapped, as shipping lines can no longer afford to keep them afloat. In turn shipbreaking industries fuels local businesses in iron milling and create local markets for parts from ships, including anything salvaged, from doors and tables to nuts and bolts. Shipping companies often sell their decommission ships to intermediary companies that then sell the ships to breakers yards. Less scrupulous companies will not ensure the ships are as free of toxic materials as they should be before they are dismantled and even change their flag of convenience so they are not bound by the UN Basel convention on the exporting of toxic material. In 2006 legal actions instigated by Hasan were successful in turning away two toxic-laden ships from being beached in Bangladesh. The dangerous job of breaking up ships has migrated from dry docks in industrial countries to other ports across the world, where labor and environmental laws are not strictly upheld. While still happening on a smaller scale in India, it was because of tighter laws there that more ships started being beached across the Bay of Bengal. The bulk of Bangladesh's shipbreaking is done on the beaches around Chittagong in southeastern Bangladesh. Casual laborers often include children and don't have the most basic of protection gear, such as gloves, hard hats or face masks while breaking up the ship by hand and have to handle a cocktail of toxic waste including asbestos, PCBs, lead and other heavy metals.  See more photos of the shipbreaking yards Â» . Accidents and death are common, although Hasan says it's almost impossible to say how many accidents occur; the shipbreaking companies are cagey on the numbers. \"I call it exploitation, I don't call it employment. The majority of the laborers are seasonal migrants from the north, the poorest of the poor. They will get three meals and day and rarely some payment, but they will definitely get diseases,\" said Hasan. Environmental devastation . As well as the human impact, the environmental damage has been equally devastating, with heavy metals contaminating the surrounding land, oil leaking into the oceans, and asbestos released into the air. Mangroves, natural protection zones against floods, have been cut down to make way for the shipbreaking yards and high value beachland leased out to the companies that run them. Fishing, the traditional livelihood of many in the region, has been ruined because of polluted water and few fish left in coastal waters. \"Bangladesh is allowing its beach to turn into a dumping ground. It's a classic example of environmental injustice,\" said Hasan. Yet Hasan is not denouncing the industry completely but the way in which it is conducted. \"It's a matter of disgrace for Bangladesh to have this industry in its current form. I'm not saying I want the industry to shut down, because the main stakeholders, the workers have a say in this. They should have a say whether we need the industry or not,\" said Hasan. There have been improvements in the treatment of workers since the High Court of Bangladesh ruled in March in favor of tighter regulations surrounding the industry. \"Until very recently the owners [of the shipbreaking companies] didn't take responsibility for deaths or injuries. After we started filing the cases they have started paying compensation.\" The cases Hasan won were founded on the U.N.'s Basel Convention on the export and disposal of toxic waste. Although it has provided the means for Hasan and her team to score victories in the courts, the Basel ruling is a set of guidelines where the principal was to regulate toxic waste and not a legally binding rule for shipping. Adamson maintains that the Basle convention and other UN measures to protect ship workers and the environment were \"heavily involved\" in the draft convention. He also questions the usefulness of a convention that does not get universal agreement. \"There is nothing that can force a sovereign state to become party to an international convention should it consider it not in its interests to do so. What would be the value of a convention to which those states were not party? That, I think, is very much at the heart of the matter,\" he told CNN. Regardless of the final wording of the convention, Hasan's attentions will focus on improving the situation in Bangladesh for shipbreaking workers and the environment. \"There's something called natural justice. Enough is enough. Since the workers have been informed that there has been a ruling things have changed; they're getting their compensation. But that's not my goal -- to kill people and then give them compensation. My ultimate goal is to see this industry doesn't pollute and does not kill,\" said Hasan.",

    "input": "New York (CNN) -- After the Alzheimer's came, my mother could not know how shadows fell across our once ebullient family: our solidarity fractured, our tempers flaring in furious incomprehension, hearts breaking in mute despair. None of us knew how to watch this woman disappear, her features slowly masked with blankness, her supple body rigid and wooden, her absolute vividness obliterated by the heavy fog of her disease. As those of us touched in some way by Alzheimer's know too well, the emotional, social and economic burden of this disease is nearly unbearable -- for individuals, for families and for our country: . â¢ 5.3 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's disease; a new case develops every 70 seconds. â¢ One in eight people aged 65 and older has the disease, and the risk is even higher for those over 85. â¢ Today, 9.9 million people are caring for a family member with Alzheimer's. â¢ Alzheimer's and other dementias cost Medicare, Medicaid and businesses $148 billion annually, a number that will grow quickly and substantially as baby boomers reach age 65. Prevention. Cure. Hope. These are words seldom associated with Alzheimer's disease. But groundbreaking scientific research and an opportunity for powerful collaborations could lead to discovery of the ultimate cure for Alzheimer's disease: its prevention. I know this is so because my friend Dr. Karen Hsiao Ashe, an internationally renowned Alzheimer's disease researcher at the University of Minnesota, has developed a research road map that calls for bringing together a group of the world's foremost laboratory and clinical investigators in the field to make prevention a reality by 2020. This achievable goal adds \"hope\" to the vocabulary of Alzheimer's disease and holds the promise that my children and yours will never suffer its hardship. My son, Alec, is an artist like his late grandmother. His paintings are large and uncompromising, stunning in texture, original in design. He's got the real thing. He's got \"it,\" just as she had. But what if he also has something else, like the APOE-e4 gene, known to increase the risk of Alzheimer's? What if he is in line to inherit this devastating disease? What I could barely endure happening to my mother, I know I could not possibly endure happening to my son. So, like my friend Karen, I embrace prevention as the ultimate cure for Alzheimer's disease. Anything short of that is too risky. Karen is identifying the biological processes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease -- long before symptoms appear -- to develop cost-effective, widely available interventions. She compares Alzheimer's disease prevention to the polio vaccine: \"Had a vaccine not been developed for polio, hospital wards today would be filled with people needing artificial ventilators to breathe. Similarly, not only is treatment of Alzheimer's likely to be less effective than prevention, it's also likely to be 10 to 10,000 times more expensive,\" she recently told Twin Cities Business magazine. Karen and her colleagues are homing in on a promising possibility: a pill containing the molecular compound that could block the chemical chain reaction in the brain that leads to Alzheimer's. So what's the holdup? Well, money, of course, and attitude, perhaps. Finding a treatment within the next 10 years that will prevent Alzheimer's disease will require a major national investment to bring together the scientists to develop an effective, safe and affordable way to block the disease. According to Harry Johns, president and CEO of the Alzheimer's Association, \"No other disease causes so much suffering, is so certainly fatal, affects so many and drives so much cost with so little spent to overcome it.\" Why is that? Johns names ignorance, age discrimination, stigma and denial as likely explanations. My plea is deeply personal, but by 2050, Alzheimer's will affect as many as 16 million Americans, and none of us will be able to deny the reality. We must fight mightily now to prevent the shadow of this disease from darkening the lives of our children and grandchildren. We must invest today in research that will most swiftly lead to the ultimate cure: prevention. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kate Mulgrew.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- What would truly delight the geek in your life? It's nearly impossible to know if you don't share his or her peculiar tastes. It's not good enough just to get them a Rubik's Cube or copy of \"The Hobbit.\" (You know they could solve a Rubik's Cube by the time they were 7, and they already own the complete collection of Tolkien in hardback.) Show them you care by learning about the things they like and demonstrating that knowledge with your gift choice. Start by determining what the geek in your life is obsessed with. Geeks are passionate about niche interests, and a little digging on your part is sure to result in a wide-eyed, bouncy, emphatic \"thank you!\" when it's time to open presents. Once you have a good idea, look to niche, online shopping destinations such as ThinkGeek, Big Bad Toy Store, Nichibei, EA, SteamPowered and The Space Store. \"We sell what we think is cool,\" Shane Peterman of ThinkGeek said. \"Everyone here, all the product buyers, we're all geeks. So we have a pretty good handle on what we think would work.\" Peterman said that sci-fi and fantasy-related merchandise always sells well for ThinkGeek, including anything having to do with franchises such as \"Star Wars,\" \"Star Trek,\" \"Doctor Who\" and \"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.\" You can also find plenty of geeky merchandise on broader sites such as Amazon or Best Buy. Too late for shipping? Head for a comic book store, where you can generally find figurines, collectable action figures and specialized merchandise as well as comic books, graphic novels, DVDs and manga. To find the comic book store nearest you, go to comicshoplocator.com. Or check out a hobby shop, which may have a room dedicated to games. Also go to gaming stores or bookstores. Bookstores such as Barnes & Noble or Borders have gaming books, comics and manga as well. Geek merchandise can be confusing for a gift-giver who doesn't know what \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" is. (It's a popular Japanese franchise about a group of teenagers who pilot robot-like vehicles in an apocalyptic war against \"Angels.\") That's why CNN.com's Geek Out! team collaborated with experts to compile a list of gift suggestions for the geeks in your life. But geeks are not one-size-fits-all, and our gift suggestions might not be right for your situation. If you can't find the specific thing the geek in your life likes, ask for help in a bookstore or comic shop. There's usually one go-to geek on staff who can assist, pointing out suitable gifts within the genre. For example, if the comic book geek in your life has a good relationship with the local comic shop purveyor, they might have an established wish list of comic books from certain authors or artists. Fans of some sci-fi or fantasy television shows may also be part of the comic book fan culture, since many shows, such as \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" \"True Blood,\" \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Firefly,\" continue and develop story lines in comic book format. Volumes collecting six-issue (or more) storylines are a growing phenomenon in the comic book world, so these would certainly be a big hit with the comic book geek in your life. \"Japanophile\" geeks crave stories and characters that are different from American comic books and animation, said Colette Bennett, editor-in-chief of Tomopop.com, a blog about Japanese toys, collectibles and fan culture. \"From Japan's obsession with over-the-top romance to the emphasis on always \"doing your best\" and working hard, there's something about [Japanese entertainment] that really makes you feel good,\" Bennett said. That's why these geeks turn to manga, a Japanese take on the comic book format, and anime, animated series and movies often based on the story lines in manga. Titans in anime include filmmakers Hayao Miyazaki, often called the \"Walt Disney of Japan,\" and Katsuhiro Otomo, who created the groundbreaking 1988 film \"Akira.\" While \"Star Trek\" and \"Star Wars\" have long defined what a passionate, sci-fi geek is all about, other established franchises such as \"Doctor Who\" and \"Battlestar Galactica\" and newer shows such as \"Fringe\" also have large, passionate fan bases. It's critical to establish which character, space ship or story line the sci-fi geek is interested in. If your geek likes \"Star Wars,\" don't assume that anything \"Star Wars\"-related will do. Keep in mind there may be several iterations of the sci-fi franchise. Starwars.com and startrek.com include information about their different incarnations. The mainstreaming of some fantasy franchises certainly makes shopping for a fantasy geek easy, since merchandise is widely available. You'd have to be pretty out of touch not to be aware of characters and plot from \"The Lord of the Rings\" or \"Harry Potter,\" given the popularity of the books and movies in the past decade. \"We love to love the good guys and love to hate the bad guys. With the added factor of magic and/or futuristic technology thrown in, anything is possible,\" said Pat Dawson, a senior staffer of TheOneRing.net, a Tolkien fan site. See TheOneRing.net's Tolkien gift guide . Gamer geeks may prefer retro selections like the Atari and Nintendo games from arcades. Others could be into first-person shooter games or strategy games. Gamers aren't limited to computer or console games -- tabletop games such as Dungeons & Dragons capitalize on imagination and a role-playing penchant. Most gamers like to stay on the cutting edge of titles and tech. So if a game came out in November, it is likely they already have it. But downloadable content -- content that adds to games after they are released -- and add-ons that make game-play faster will be appreciated gifts. Of course, gift cards for game shops and outlets are the easiest way to please a gamer because they can choose exactly what they want. Just don't be alarmed when you hear, \"Thanks for 'Slaughter Fest 2010,' Grandma!\" Shopping for an astronomy geek can be tough. They're not a one-star-fits-all kind of crowd, explained Brittney Dempsey, office manager for NASA's online Space Store. There are star geeks who like memorizing constellations and myths, NASA lovers who obsess over space travel and physics geeks who love stargazing and mapping. Before you pick a gift, make sure you know which kind of space geek you're dealing with. Piece of advice: Space geeks are not necessarily \"Star Trek\" or \"Star Wars\" geeks. If you assume they are, be prepared -- your space geek will be quick to point out the differences between the reality that interests them and science fiction. Henry Hanks, Jamie Gumbrecht and Larry Frum contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- The Cairo Criminal Court approved a freeze on the assets of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and upheld a travel ban against him Tuesday as the nation moves forward in pressing corruption charges against the ousted leader. Mubarak's attorney, Samir Shishtawi, said he has filed an appeal. Egypt's Supreme Court is considering lifting the secret status that shields Mubarak's accounts and holdings, which could potentially unleash a flood of information. Mubarak, who is believed to be living at his residence in the Red Sea resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, is wanted for questioning in a corruption case. Attorney General Abdel Maguid Mahmoud issued an order freezing the assets of Mubarak and his family on February 28 and prohibited them from leaving the country. Mahmoud ordered the freeze for property owned by Mubarak, his wife, Suzanne, his two sons Alaa and Gamal Mubarak, and their wives and children, state-run EgyNews reported. The seizures include \"movable properties, real estate, stocks, bonds and various financial assets.\" It wasn't immediately clear how the order differed from an earlier order. Mubarak, through his attorneys and in official filings, has described reports of immense wealth as \"fabrications and baseless rumors.\" Mubarak resigned February 11 after 18 days of protests against his rule. Egyptian politician Mustafa Bakri, who has led the fight to press corruption charges against Mubarak, said he believes the former president will stand trial. Bakri, a member of Egypt's parliament who lost his seat after filing corruption cases against various officials, provided documents indicating Mubarak's family has secret bank accounts totaling more than 200 million Egyptian pounds ($147 million), according to EgyNews. \"This is the second stage of the revolution,\" Bakri told CNN. CNN's Nima Elbagir and journalist Mohamed Fadel Fahmy contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- President Obama told CNN's Larry King on Thursday that he is furious about the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, but his job is to fix things instead of just yelling at people. In a White House interview for the 25th anniversary of \"Larry King Live\" on CNN, Obama called the oil spill an unprecedented crisis for the country but added it could have been worse. Despite the challenges posed by the oil spill, global threats involving North Korea and Iran and political battles with Congress, Obama called being president \"the best job on Earth.\" \"It's an extraordinary privilege to wake up every day and know you have the opportunity to serve the American people and make life better,\" he said. King noted that the latest CNN Poll of Polls showed Obama at 48 percent support among the American people, which the president called pretty good, considering the circumstances. \"Given everything that's going on, my poll numbers are all right,\" Obama said. Asked about his anger toward the oil spill situation, Obama said he was furious because \"somebody didn't think through the consequences of their actions.\" Obama also said he had not seen enough of a rapid response from BP to the environmental catastrophe. \"I would love to just spend a lot of my time venting and yelling at people, but that's not the job I was hired to do,\" Obama said. \"My job is to solve this problem and ultimately this isn't about me and how angry I am. Ultimately this is about the people down in the Gulf who are being impacted and what am I doing to make sure that they're able to salvage their way of life.\" Oil giant BP caused the spill and is responsible for paying the costs, Obama said, adding: \"My job is to make sure they're being held accountable.\" In the wide-ranging interview to be broadcast Thursday night, Obama also acknowledged Israel's security concerns while questioning the Israeli blockade of Gaza following this week's military raid on a flotilla of ships carrying relief supplies to the Palestinian territory. The president called the incident that killed nine people, including a Turkish-American man, a \"tragic situation\" that could serve as \"an opportunity\" to advance the Middle East peace process.\" On the oil spill, Obama said BP has the best technology and know-how to try to stop the leak, but the president indicated that the spill could continue until relief wells being drilled now are completed in August. Despite the havoc that the oil spill is causing to Gulf fisheries and fragile wetlands, Obama said he still supports off-shore drilling \"if it can be done safely.\" Asked about reports that his administration had extended a moratorium on offshore drilling to shallow water rigs, Obama denied it. \"Actually the moratorium is not extended to the shallow waters,\" the president said. On another topic, Obama criticized Arizona's controversial new immigration law because it could lead to \"50 different laws in 50 different states\" regarding border security, which is a federal concern. The interview took place shortly after Obama met with Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, who said Obama pledged to work with her on solving the immigration problem. The new Arizona law, which takes effect in July, allows police officers to check the residency status of anyone who is being investigated for a crime or possible legal infraction if there is reasonable suspicion the person is an illegal resident. Critics, including Attorney General Eric Holder, have said the law will promote racial profiling. Obama told CNN that the issue required a broader response than just strengthening border security, and he urged Congress to work with him on comprehensive immigration reform that would tighten the border while requiring illegal immigrants to register, pay back taxes and penalties, learn English and seek citizenship through normal channels. The president also discussed the status of pending free agent basketball star Lebron James, saying that part of him hoped James would re-sign with the Cleveland Cavaliers because it would be a \"great story.\" Obama, who is from Chicago and a known fan of the hometown Bulls, acknowledged his response might make people there unhappy. The president also called Wednesday night's White House concert honoring former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney a great event, particularly when McCartney serenaded the first lady with the love ballad that shares her first name, \"Michelle.\" \"When she was a little girl growing up on the South Side (of Chicago), I don't think she ever imagined that happening,\" Obama said.",

    "input": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- FBI agents temporarily deployed to Iraq received an average of about $45,000 in excessive overtime because they billed the government for 16 hours a day throughout their 90-day assignments, according to a Justice Department audit. Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine released the audit on Thursday. The audit, released Thursday by Inspector General Glenn Fine, found the agents routinely submitted the overtime with the blessing of their managers from 2003 through 2007. The report says the excessive overtime totaled $7.8 million. \"The FBI inappropriately permitted employees to regularly claim overtime for activities that are not compensable as work, such as time spent eating meals, exercising more than 3 hours per week, and socializing,\" the report said. The socializing included going to movies and cocktail parties. The FBI promptly responded to the report, acknowledging the overtime policy was designed to encourage FBI employees to volunteer for Iraq duty, but should not have been used and has now been corrected. The 88-page report documenting the overtime issues found the FBI had initially approved the policy of paying for 16-hour days because conditions were harsh, there were few recreational opportunities and employees were always \"on call.\" But the audit said that violates federal pay guidelines. The FBI admitted that \"a flawed system was allowed to develop and remain in place too long,\" but it also sought to explain how the practice started. \"Early in the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq FBI managers traveled to those war zones and saw first hand the challenges of a 24/7 threat environment. FBI employees lived with sniper attacks, mortar fire, and roadside bombs as part of their daily work environment. They attempted to adapt a long established domestic pay system for domestic law enforcement to unprecedented wartime assignments for FBI personnel.\" FBI agents in Iraq perform a variety of duties, according to the bureau's Web site. Agents interview suspected terrorists captured by the military; gather intelligence; collect evidence from crime scenes like car bombs or mass graves; and investigate crimes committed by Americans against Iraqis, as well as those that Iraqis commit against their fellow citizens. The inspector general's report said overtime pay was less excessive for FBI personnel in Afghanistan. The report also found that somewhat less excessive overtime was paid to agents from other Justice Department agencies who were sent to Iraq, including deputy marshals, and ATF and DEA agents.",

Earlier this year, anti-Gadhafi fighters ransacking his compound in Tripoli found an album of photos of the former top Bush administration official. \"Quite extraordinary, weird and a bit creepy, \" Rice told CNN's Piers Morgan on Wednesday night about the scrapbook. \"I had actually known that he had this fixation on me.\" Rice said when Gadhafi showed her the video montage years ago in Libya, she tried to keep the conversation on business. \"My job was to go there and do diplomatic business and get out, so that's what I did,\" she said. \"But I have to say I did have that terrible moment when he said that he had the video.

    "input": "(CNN) -- At least 26 people were killed Monday in the Syrian government's ongoing crackdown on dissidents, the pro-democracy group Local Coordination Committees of Syria said. Among the dead was a 12-year-old boy shot to death when Syrian security forces fired on a funeral procession, according to the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.. The funeral procession was for a protester killed Sunday, the observatory said. In addition, 17 people were killed during operations by the military and security forces in Hama as authorities searched for wanted activists and demonstrators, the organization said. Meanwhile, an adviser to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said parliamentary elections could be held in the country by the end of the year, Russian media reported earlier Monday. Bouthaina Shaaban, the political and media adviser to al-Assad, was in Moscow on Monday to speak to journalists on the situation in Syria. \"I can tentatively say that such elections may be held either at the end of this year or the beginning of next,\" Shaaban said, according to the RIA-Novosti news agency. The number of people killed in unrest in Syria since mid-March has reached at least 2,600, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said Monday. The U.S. State Department, meanwhile, is condemning the killing of a key Syrian opposition organizer who it says died while in the custody of Syria's security forces. Ghiyath Mattar, described as a key organizer of protests against al-Assad's regime, was killed after being arrested last Tuesday in the Damascus suburb of Darya, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said in a statement released Sunday. \"His brave commitment to confronting the regime's despicable violence with peaceful protest serves as an example for the Syrian people and for all those who suffer under the yoke of oppression,\" the statement said . Mattar was arrested along with leading opposition activist Yahya Sharbaji and a number of other activists, Nuland said. Mattar was \"a symbol of what the Syrian revolution should be -- peaceful and nonviolent,\" said one of Mattar's friends. \"His death is an attack by the regime on peace. His attack is saying, 'We want to destroy the messengers of peace in Syria and the ideals and values they hold.\" \"His personality was perfectly built to take the role of a leader,\" said another man, a colleague of Mattar's. \"Everyone loved him and he had so many close friends and relatives.\" Both men asked not to be named for fear of retribution. On September 6, Mattar was with Sharbaji when he received a call from Sharbaji's brother saying he was injured and needed help, according to the friend. In reality, security forces had forced the brother to call Sharbaji. The operation led to the arrests, the friend said. Unrest has plagued Syria for more than six months, as protesters demanding more freedom, democratic elections and an end to al-Assad's regime have been met by brute force. The government has maintained a consistent narrative: It is going after armed terrorists. But opposition activists say the regime is behind a systematic, sustained slaughter. Mattar, 26, was on the run for three months before being taken into custody, according to the Syrian Observatory. The group, citing reports from Mattar's fellow opposition members, said he was tortured to death. Syria's crackdown on protesters has been roundly condemned by many world leaders and the United Nations. The Arab League has publicly called for al-Assad's regime to show restraint and end the violence. The United States has imposed sanctions on Syria, freezing assets of specific regime members and banning Americans from doing business with the country. The European Union banned the import of Syrian oil and imposed a travel ban. Navi Pillay, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, put the number killed in the unrest at 2,600, citing \"reliable sources on the ground,\" in remarks prepared for delivery Tuesday during the commission's session. The Syrian Observatory has said more than 2,000 people -- mostly demonstrators -- have died since the uprising began in mid-March. In her statement, Nuland repeated calls by the United States for al-Assad to step down. \"We call on the (al-Assad) regime to immediately cease all violence against the Syrian people and release all political prisoners. We again call on (al-Assad) to step aside and allow the Syrian people to embark upon the democratic transformation they demand,\" she said the in the statement. A video posted on YouTube purportedly showing the funeral of Mattar in Darya showed people marching in the street and chanting: \"We will sacrifice our lives and our blood for you, Ghiyath\" and \"Freedom, freedom, we are the youths of freedom.\" Mattar's colleague said that Syrian security forces fired on mourners, and that one man was shot and later died. CNN can not independently verify the authenticity of the video, the claims or the death toll because the government has repeatedly denied requests for journalists to report inside Syria. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz, Maxim Tkachenko, Mohammed Jamjoom and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- If \"Can I kick it?\" provokes an almost involuntary \"Yes, you can!\" and \"You're on point, Phife\" brings \"All the time, Tip,\" then you're in the right place. If your idea of hip-hop is confined to Snoop Dawg, NWA or Public Enemy, then you'll also benefit from spending a little time with Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad and Jarobi White, aka A Tribe Called Quest. In \"Beats, Rhymes & Life: The Travels of a Tribe Called Quest,\" actor Michael Rapaport tries out his directorial chops by attempting to document the rise, fall, rise (again) and fall (again) of the seminal New York hip-hop group, achieving mixed results. Although the film is chock-a-block with great music and interesting characters, it lacks a coherent focus and seems to want to be all films to all people. A mixture of footage shot for this film and that from other sources, the documentary jumps back and forth between the band's early days, their first split in 1998 and their reunion (and subsequent second break-up) in 2008 on the Rock the Bells tour. It gives a reasonably detailed and personal look into what made the band tick as well as what made them stop. Unfortunately, it doesn't work as a whole. Great documentaries most often latch on to the universality of their subject and connect on an emotional or intellectual level with their audience. They can be about an obscure, unattractive animal (naked mole rats, anyone?), a troubled child in a small town (\"Billy the Kid\") or a wacky modern-day philosopher king/tour guide (\"The Cruise\"), but they have a purpose, a point of view and a connection with the audience. \"Beats, Rhymes & Life,\" while loaded with great material, lacks that connection. Clearly charismatic and talented men, the four members of Tribe (White left the group for a significant stretch during its heyday but rejoined them for occasional reunion tours) have a lot to say about how they met, how they worked together and how they broke up, but the film never really pieces this together in any sort of narrative that can be closely followed. Phife Dawg's health problems (he is a type-1 diabetic who undergoes a kidney transplant during the film) are mentioned, but only White, ironically the least-involved member of the group, shows any real emotions about his friend's dire health condition. In the film's only other real showing of emotion, we learn that Phife Dawg's wife is a match, and she donates one of her kidneys. For New Yorkers or hip-hop fans (of which this critic is both), the film offers frequent bits of interest, humor and musical delight and is certainly a pleasant way to spend 98 minutes. Phife Dawg is especially loquacious, waxing rhapsodic on subjects as diverse as his eating habits (he lists Lorna Doones as one of the snack foods he's had to give up) and basketball.

Phife replies, rapid-fire, without missing a beat, that he loves the Knicks, but their front office is a mess and \"I like Amar'e Stoudemire, but I'm gonna need him to play some defense.\" However, while the members of Tribe are all talented and charismatic artists with interesting and compelling stories to tell, \"Beats, Rhymes & Life\" doesn't tell them fully. It's a complex story involving music, family, history and the greater world of New York hip-hop (which is in and of itself worth of a film), and what it comes down to is that Rapaport had so many directions to choose, so much footage to watch, that the film suffers from the overload. Perhaps choosing a subject that is a little less close to his heart will afford Rapaport the distance that is sometimes needed to make a compelling documentary.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The transitional government of Guinea-Bissau said its forces killed six people amid an attack on the barracks of an elite military unit near the capital's airport. The transitional authorities, which took power in the West African nation after military commanders overthrew the previous government in April, said they believed the attempt to seize control of the barracks on Saturday night was led by people loyal to the former prime minister Carlos Gomes Jr. The government said the assault was a \"premeditated action aiming at destabilizing the legal order and whose main aim is to create a political situation where an international force in Guinea-Bissau could be justified.\" Six attackers were killed in the fighting at the Para-Commando barracks, two were captured and an unspecified number remain at large, the government said. It added that one government soldier was wounded. Gomes Jr. and the former interim president Raimundo Pereira fled to Portugal after the generals ousted them in April on accusations they had agreed a \"secret deal\" to let Angolan troops into the country to attack the military. The coup prompted international condemnation and calls for a return to civilian rule by the African Union, the United Nations and Western powers. Guinea-Bissau suspended from African Union . The regional Economic Community of West African States brokered a deal to set up the current transitional government, which has until May to organize presidential and legislative elections. The regional body agreed to deploy about 600 peacekeeping troops in Guinea-Bissau to monitor the transition and replace the Angolan soldiers that were in the country. Angola had said its military personnel were there to help reform the Guinea-Bissau armed and security forces. Coups and coup attempts have taken place repeatedly in Guinea-Bissau since it won independence from Portugal in 1974. To date, no democratically elected president of the country has served a full five-year term. Pereira became interim president after the January death of incumbent Malam Bacai Sanha after a long illness. Sanha had become president in September 2009 after the assassination of his predecessor, Joao Bernardo Vieira. Guinea-Bissau is a small coastal nation of about 1.6 million people sandwiched between Senegal and Guinea. TIME: Guinea-Bissau: How cocaine transformed a tiny nation .",

The 23-year-old collapsed at Tottenham Hotspur's White Hart Lane stadium in London during an English FA Cup quarterfinal game and was treated by paramedics on the pitch. He was subsequently taken to the London Chest Hospital where he has been in a critical condition since Saturday evening. But a joint statement released by the hospital and Bolton on Monday evening said Muamba's condition had marginally improved. Soccer star Muamba still 'critical' after on-pitch collapse . It read: \"Fabrice Muamba is continuing to show signs of improvement this evening. \"He is currently able to breathe independently without the aid of a ventilator. He has also been able to recognize family members and respond to questions appropriately. \"These are all positive signs of progress. However, his condition remains serious and the medical staff in intensive care will continue to monitor and treat him.\" Muamba was born in Zaire but was brought up in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He moved to England when he was 11. He represented England at under-21 level and has played for English Premier League side Arsenal, as well as Birmingham City, before moving to Bolton in 2008 for a fee of ÃÂ£5 million ($8 million). He collapsed after 41 minutes of the last eight tie against Tottenham, with players from both sides urging medical assistance straight away. Fears for stricken soccer player Muamba's recovery . Stunned supporters looked on as he was treated on the field while reports in the UK press claimed it took two hours for Muamba's heart to start beating normally again. Referee Howard Webb abandoned the match after consultation with players and managers from both sides. Bolton's Premier League game with Aston Villa, scheduled for Tuesday, has also been called off. Muamba's manager Owen Coyle has regularly visited the hospital where he is being treated, as have players from Bolton and other Premier League clubs. Spanish club Real Madrid carried shirts that read \"Get well soon Muamba\" before their draw with Malaga on Sunday, and Coyle said the player's family were grateful for all the support they had received from around the globe. \"The message is the good will, the prayers from everybody, they are so thankful and they want to put that on record -- to say 'keep up the prayers, thanks for all the support,' \" the Scot told reporters. \"They have been inundated as we all have, both in the football community globally and family and friends. People are taking a genuine interest and a real concern with how Fabrice is doing. \"It's a difficult situation but the family are bearing up as well as they can. They themselves are very positive people. Players pray for Muamba's recovery . \"You look at what Fabrice has been through in life already and you can tell that he is a fighter. He has such a fantastic smile and that's what we all want to see again.\" Muamba's wife Shauna took to Twitter on Monday to say: \"All your prayers are working people thank u so so much. Every prayer makes him stronger. \" There have been other cases of players collapsing during soccer matches. Motherwell's Phil O'Donnell suffered heart failure during a 2007 game against Scottish rivals Dundee United and died on the way to hospital. The most high-profile tragedy of this kind came when Cameroon international Marc-Vivien Foe collapsed during a Confederations Cup semifinal against Colombia in 2003 and died in hospital.

    "input": "(CNN) -- From the time she was an 11-year-old, blue-eyed, freckle-faced blonde until she was a 29-year-old woman with two children, Jaycee Dugard was kept locked away in a backyard compound of sheds and tarps by a couple who police say abducted her. Jaycee Dugard was locked in a shed tucked under a blue tarp in her alleged captor's backyard. She was more than 160 miles from home, and her family had no idea where she was. Nobody else knew she was there except the couple who snatched her off the street in front of her house in South Lake Tahoe, California, in 1991, and took her straight to the soundproof shed, police said. Dugard's pocket of Phillip and Nancy Garrido's backyard in Antioch, California, was so overgrown no one even knew it existed. The details about Dugard's time in captivity emerged Thursday after one of Northern California's most enduring mysteries was solved and the Garridos were arrested and accused of her kidnapping. Anyone who came across the couple's backyard, littered with garbage cans and a dishwasher, would assume that it ended at a 6-foot fence.  Watch aerial images of the backyard compound Â» . \"You could walk through the backyard and never know there was another set of living circumstances,\" said Fred Kollar, undersheriff of El Dorado County. \"There was nothing that would cause you to question it. You can't see it from either adjoining property. It was presumably well arranged.\" But tucked away beyond the tangle of bushes, high grass and trees was a blue tarp that concealed the only world Dugard had known since her abduction. Kollar said the property had \"a hidden backyard within a backyard.\" It included several sheds no taller than 6 feet, two tents and several outbuildings, \"where Jaycee and the girls spent most of their lives.\" It also held a vehicle that matched the description of the car used in Dugard's kidnapping, Kollar said. The \"secondary\" backyard was inside the first and was \"screened from view.\" One of the sheds was soundproof, he said. In it were sheds and tarps, a makeshift bathroom and shower, along with electricity supplied by extension cords. Kollar compared the primitive conditions to camping. Dugard lived for several years there by herself. The sheds were locked from the outside. She grew up and had her captor's children there, and raised them there. \"None of them have ever been to school, they've never been to a doctor,\" Kollar said. \"They were kept in complete isolation in this compound, if you will, at the rear of the house,\" he said. \"They were born there.\" The children, both girls, are now 15 and 11. \"They are all in good health,\" Kollar said in response to a question about how Dugard and her children are doing. \"But living in a backyard for the last 18 years does take its toll.\" Dugard's presence behind Garrido's home apparently went unnoticed by many in the neighborhood, where homes on one-fourth to one-half-acre lots typically sell for less than $200,000.  Watch neighbors react Â» . \"My dad said he never saw a young woman,\" said Kathy Russo, whose father has lived two houses away from the Garridos for 33 years. She said the one-story house's backyard was obscured by trees and ringed by a wooden fence. Her 94-year-old father considered Garrido to be a \"kind of strange, reclusive, kind of an angry kind of guy,\" Russo said. But one man who lives in the neighborhood told CNN that he called the local sheriff's department a few years ago after seeing what he thought were several children living in the backyard. The man said authorities came out and had a brief conversation with the Garrido family, but nothing ever happened.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- China will launch its historic space docking mission Saturday along with its first female astronaut in space. Liu Yang has been selected to join two male astronauts, Jing Haipeng and Liu Wang, as part of a three-person crew aboard the Shenzhou-9, according to China's manned space docking program, which says the mission will last 10 days. A launch time is set for 6:37 p.m. local time (6:37 a.m. ET) at a satellite center in northwestern Gansu province. The carrier rocket, the Long March-2F, was scheduled to start fueling Friday afternoon, and the launch ground and control systems are ready, state media reported. Echoing a famous Chinese proverb, Wu Ping, a spokeswoman for China's manned space program said, \"Women hold up half the sky. Human space missions without women are incomplete.\" Chinese women push for a place in space . According to Xinhua, Liu, 33, was the deputy head of a flight unit of the PLA's Air Force and an air force major. She is also a veteran pilot with 1,680 hours of flying experience and, after two years of training, excelled in testing before being selected with another female, Wang Yaping, as a candidate for the crew. On the eve of the mission, however, it was Liu who won the coveted spot. Wu said that the participation of women in space will aid training, improve flight crew equipment and expand knowledge on the physical and psychological effects of space on women. \"It will also further expand the social impact of human space missions and showcase the positive image of Chinese women,\" Wu said. \"As a woman, I am eagerly looking forward to this flight with a female astronaut.\" In another milestone, Jing will be China's first astronaut to travel twice into space, Xinhua reported. Like his other two crewmembers, Jing is a former pilot of the People's Liberation Army and a member of the Communist Party of China, according to Xinhua. If all goes well, the Shenzhou-9 will dock with China's orbiting space laboratory, making the nation the third after the United States and Russia to complete a manned space docking. As a precaution in case of an emergency, one of the crewmembers will not board the lab, the space program said in February. China has big aspirations for its program and hopes to build a space station and conduct a manned mission to the moon. Read about China's space plans . The orbiting Tiangong-1 space lab module was launched into space in September, and two months later it successfully completed China's first space docking with an unmanned spacecraft, Shenzhou-8, according to Xinhua news agency. The efforts demonstrate \"China's continued commitment to becoming a first-class space power with an independent space capability,\" Taylor Fravel, associate professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said this year. \"This is a very exclusive club.\" China's efforts come as the United States refocuses its space program toward deep space exploration, and private companies such as SpaceX make strides toward the commercialization of spaceflight. Last month, SpaceX's unmanned Dragon capsule completed the first commercial mission to the International Space Station. CNN's Steven Jiang and Jaime FlorCruz contributed to this report.",

    "input": "(Sunset) -- '\"I had such a crush on him when I was a kid,\" says my friend Didi Linburn, pigtails peeking out from beneath her pink ski helmet rather than the wool pompom hat she wore as a kid. I peer into the tiny ski shop at the Alta Peruvian Lodge and catch a glimpse of a cute guy in glasses behind the counter. \"No idea how old he is,\" she says, \"but I've seen him here every winter since I was 15.\" Didi and Jeff Linburn on the slopes . Twenty-two years later, and Didi and her teenage crush are still here? I've yet to even take a run down the powder white slopes, but I already sense that Alta, Utah, just might be as special as everyone says it is -- including my self-proclaimed \"Altaholic\" husband. Tired of not getting an invite to his annual \"guys' trip,\" and admittedly jealous about the other love in his life, I decided to tag along on Didi's annual father-daughter jaunt. And finally experience for myself this almighty Alta -- with just seven lifts (and not much else) spread across 2,200 acres of heart-pumping hikes and narrow chutes, chest-deep powder, and total lack of pretension. Skis slung over our shoulders, we walk out the weathered wooden door of the lodge, taking in a deep breath of fresh -- albeit thin -- mountain air. I'm instantly happy to be here at 10,550 feet, on leased U.S. Forest Service land at the resolutely un-corporate resort, where faded one-pieces outnumber Bogner jackets, chairlifts seat at most four across, and five no-frills lodges, scattered up Little Cottonwood Canyon, sleep 1,200 skiers, tops. Skiers. Not shoppers. Not ski bunnies. Sunset.com: Plan your trip to Alta . And, above all, not snowboarders. As the mountain motto goes, Alta is for skiers. During my stay, I see it flaunted on banners, baseball caps, bumper stickers. Alta is, after all, one of just three resorts left in the country that ban boarders, since Taos Ski Valley opened its slopes to all in March. Geared up, Didi, her dad, and I creep along in a bar-less triple chair, surrounded by nothing save blue sky and the towering peaks of the Wasatch Range. \"Same as it was in the '60s,\" says Geoff Linburn, who first came to Alta from California in search of what he'd heard was the best snow in the West. Back then, lift tickets cost $8, and there were only five slowly moving chairlifts, but apart from building a couple more and raising ticket prices to a reasonable $64, Alta remains Alta. Didi's dad smiles. \"Still the best snow in the West.\" A whopping 500 inches annually of light-as-a-feather powder -- and I can't wait to try it. But that will take some effort. Without a convenient tram to Alta's best terrain, the limited number of skiers allowed uphill work for every turn with an almost perverse pleasure. As a typically lazy, play-it-safe sort of skier, I'm intimidated. Is this really worth it? We hop off the Sugarloaf chair and onto a big \"dump\" (a record-setting blessing of snow) and join the parade of people inching their way, single file, up, up, up, and gliding precariously, over, over, over, only to climb again. Is this really worth it? I think to myself, sweating in the snow. I contemplate taking off my skis, but then I look up. \"Aw, it's a bootpacker!\" one guy yells at another fellow who's stomping with his skis on his shoulders rather than suffering the steep sidestep with everyone else. I press on, inspired by the unspoken camaraderie on the traverse toward Devil's Castle -- a wide-open bowl and depository of powder -- and the shared anticipation among strangers bound by a passion for Alta's almost guaranteed fresh tracks. Still, exhausted -- okay, panting really -- I stop and watch as the hard-core hikers keep stomping; my heart is pounding. I look downhill at the almost untouched powder and decide I've had enough hiking. Who needs the untouched stuff? Time to ski. After a blissful day on the slopes, the return to the Peruvian lodge is a comedown. The guest rooms remind me of my college dorm. There are shared bathrooms and a Ping-Pong table but no TVs. Still, the Peruvian, like all of Alta's lodges, has a 75 percent return rate. Sunset.com: Top 10 ski resorts . I'm honestly baffled, but by the end of dinner -- a slippers-acceptable, family-style affair, where a wine collector wearing turquoise sweatpants shares rare bottles he brought from home and our table swaps stories like old friend -- I start to understand. But, unlike most of the longtime guests, who remain fiercely loyal to \"their\" lodge, never venturing steps away to check out another, I'm curious and leave Didi a few nights later for Alta's Rustler Lodge, where things are a tad more civilized (read: pricey). Now I have a television and my own bathroom, and reservations are taken for the window-walled dining room, where the next morning, I overhear a waiter bellow \"Welcome back!\" to guest Roger Urban, who has been staying here since his bachelor days. He and his wife -- looking very '80s (like the lodge) in their matching rainbow-striped rugbys -- fuel up at the breakfast buffet, while their teenage daughter, Alexandra, heads out for a lesson with the same instructor she's always had. Meanwhile, I finish my eggs alone and realize that I miss the chaos of the Peruvian's hostel-like atmosphere. I slip on my skis and hop the rope tow to meet Didi for another day on the slopes. Alta never changes . From the chatter around the lift line, it's clear that it's not just the powder that draws people to Alta -- it's also the people themselves. Old college buddies, moms and sons, widows who used to come with their husbands ... everyone returns without question. Likewise, all the locals I meet say they'd intended to come out for a season and do the ski-bum thing. But before they knew it, 10, 20, 30 years had passed -- and they're still here. \"Alta just swallows you up,\" says Craig Dillon, Didi's ski shop crush, who, it turns out, is 41 and has lived here half his life. And so, because people never leave Alta, it's only natural that they grow old here. Not in the typical, canasta-by-the-pool way of growing old. Rather, Alta is like a real-life \"Cocoon,\" where the mountain is the fountain of youth. Senior passes start at age 80. Didi and I return to the Sugarloaf chair and ride up with an 86-year-old couple. \"Skiing is only getting easier!\" the husband says, beaming. \"Free tickets!\" says his wife. Inspired, I make a mental note to be just like them in 50 years. As we climb, once again, toward Devil's Castle, a father whizzes by with a tiny skier bouncing on his shoulders. \"Daddy? Are we at Devil's Castle yet?\" He hikes as far as possible, plops his daughter in knee-deep powder, and off she goes: a 4-year-old making fresh tracks. I watch, dumbfounded. And determined. I decide to hike out as far as I can. I want those fresh tracks, and this time I'm willing to work for them. Heart racing, legs aching, I reach the end of the ridge. I rest for a moment and then dip in. Flying solo through feet of untouched powder, carving near-perfect turns, snow spraying like the pros, I realize that I'm floating. This is it. This is why I've come to Alta. Sunset.com: Top 10 hotels for nature lovers . Later that evening, lounging around the Peruvian lobby after dinner -- with Scrabble, impromptu sing-alongs, nothing to face tomorrow but more fresh snow -- I get the feeling I'm continuing a tradition at risk of being lost forever to the fast-paced, froufrou world beyond Little Cottonwood Canyon. \"Everything changes in your life ... so much,\" reflects Leslie Johnson, who's been coming here every winter since 1982. \"Friends move on ... my family's homes have come and gone ... but Alta, Alta never changes.\" I get it.

    "input": "(CNN) -- British mercenary Simon Mann has been jailed for 34 years for his part in plotting a coup in Equatorial Guinea. Simon Mann was arrested after a plane carrying him and about 60 mercenaries landed in Zimbabwe. The former British military officer confessed to trying to topple long-time ruler Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo - but denied being the plot's leader. The goal of the plot was to install exiled opposition leader Severo Moto who is currently in Spain awaiting trial on charges of arms trafficking, and to gain access to the former Spanish colony's oil wealth. During the trial, Mann testified he was a \"junior\" in the organization which plotted to overthrow the tiny west African country's president in 2004, and that Lebanese businessman Eli Calil was the man in charge. \"Eli Calil was known as the cardinal -- the cardinal -- which I think says it all,\" Mann told the court.  Watch Mann's reaction to his sentences Â» . Footage of the proceedings was broadcast by Britain's Channel 4 News, which says it has the only camera in the courtroom. As Mann's trial progressed last month, South Africa rejected Mann's allegation that it had given its tacit support for the coup plot. \"South Africa will never, tacitly or expressly, support the use of mercenaries to bring about fundamental political changes in any country in our continent or elsewhere in the world including Equatorial Guinea,\" the government said in a statement. Mann testified that several governments, including Spain and the United States, welcomed the idea of a coup. Mann is a former British army commando who was arrested four years ago after a plane carrying him and about 60 mercenaries landed in Zimbabwe. The government of Equatorial Guinea said the group was on its way to overthrow its president. Mann said at the time they were going to guard a diamond mine in the Democratic Republic of Congo. A Zimbabwe court convicted Mann of trying to buy weapons illegally. He served four years in jail there before being extradited to Equatorial Guinea's capital of Malabo earlier this year to face charges of leading an abortive coup. Mann testified that his former friend Mark Thatcher -- the son of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher -- was a main partner in the plot. Thatcher was arrested along with Mann in 2004, and he pleaded guilty in South Africa the following year to unwittingly bankrolling the plot. He escaped jail time by paying a fine. Thatcher admitted giving $275,000 toward the charter of a helicopter, saying he thought was for commercial purposes and discovered only later it was to be used by mercenaries. But Mann said Thatcher paid $350,000 for a helicopter and a plane which he knew would be used in the plot, and that he attended meetings about the plan with Calil in London. Calil, Mann said, initially asked him to assassinate President Obiang and talked about the possibility of staging a guerrilla war. Mann testified he refused both requests, considering them unethical, but he did agree to help stage a coup. Though he said Thatcher was a top figure in the plot, Mann testified that even Thatcher was under Calil in the group's hierarchy. Mann, appearing in a gray prison outfit, emphasized that he was not the man in charge. Mann's defense lawyer took 45 minutes to question Mann, Channel 4 reported, in contrast to the four hours of prosecution questioning Mann faced. Mann smiled often in the footage shown by Channel 4 and even stuck his tongue out playfully at the camera. After his stint in the British army, Mann was affiliated with the South Africa-based mercenary firm Executive Outcomes. The firm described itself on its now-defunct Web site as a \"military advisory service\" that had played a \"crucial\" role in ending two African civil wars.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- While there may be a fascination with Nadya Suleman and her brood, she is hardly the first. \"Jon & Kate Plus 8\" is one of the more popular shows featuring a large family with multiples. The mother of 14, dubbed \"Octomom\" after the birth of her octuplets in January, is the target of much speculation these days as to whether she and her multitude will become the subjects of a reality show. But programming centered on large families and those containing multiples has long been popular. With so many struggling to keep up with the homework and extracurricular activities -- as well as the financial responsibilities -- of one or two children, American viewers seem fascinated with watching parents juggle life with so many kids. \"People tell me all the time, 'But for the grace of God it could be me,' \" said Bill Hayes, founder of Figure 8 Films, the production company behind the popular shows \"Jon & Kate Plus Eight\" and \"18 and Counting,\" the latter of which features the Duggar family. \"People relate that it's a challenge to have any children, much less so many.\" \"Jon & Kate Plus Eight\" has been a ratings juggernaut and follows the lives of Jon and Kate Gosselin and their eight children, including fraternal twin girls and a mixed-sex set of fraternal sextuplets (three girls and three boys).  Watch Kate Gosselin discuss the challenges of parenting Â» . Hayes' company brought the family's story to television, as well as that of Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar, who are the parents of 18 children (all conceived without the use of fertility drugs). The Duggars recently announced they're soon to be first-time grandparents. Viewers enjoy watching wholesome, family programming, especially when the subjects are as relatable as the Gosselins, Hayes said. The couple is often shown dealing with the stress that comes with having eight children under the age of 9. \"Family is very important for many people,\" he said. \"Most of us struggle with our family lives. It's not easy typically in most families. We're fortunate that Jon and Kate are very emotionally honest and they come clean.\" Fame comes with a cost, however, and the couple has become tabloid fodder with stories of interfamily squabbles and marital discord. Cable networks like TLC, Discovery Health (which are both a part of Discovery Communications) and WE: Women's Entertainment have found success with programming about super-sized families. Imitation is the sincerest form of television, comedian Fred Allen once said, and TLC in particular has made the most of its large families. In addition to the Gosselins and the Duggars, the network recently debuted \"Table for 12,\" which chronicles the daily experiences of Eric and Betty Hayes and their three sets of multiples. All told, the Hayeses have 10 children, including a special-needs child. Eileen O'Neill, president and general manger for TLC, said viewers tune in to see how it all works. \"There's that innate kind of curiosity about a family on a scale of the Duggars or 'Jon & Kate,' whether it's multiples or sheer number,\" O'Neill said. (She should know: She's a twin herself.) \"Those logistics are fascinating as well as entertaining and ultimately inspiring. So many of us are part of families or run a family and I think seeing it on a super-sized level is inherently appealing.\" As more women turn to fertility medication to help them conceive, the odds of multiple births increase. Maureen Doolan Boyle is executive director of MOST (Mothers of SuperTwins) a Long Island, New York-based organization that has worked with more than 20,000 families since its founding in 1987. Attitudes about multiple births vary around the world, Doolan Boyle said. In some cultures a large brood is welcomed; in others, it's viewed as a \"freak show\" or a curse. Canada's Dionne quintuplets, a group of five girls born to an Ontario farming family in 1934, became such a sideshow. When the girls were 5 months old, the provincial government declared the parents unfit and put the sisters under the care of a doctor and other guardians. The Dionnes were put on display in a nursery across the road from their family's farmhouse, becoming a huge tourist attraction. They even appeared in a handful of films before their parents regained custody in 1943. That \"freak show factor\" is one of the reasons there has been so much buzz surrounding Suleman and her family of 14 children, said Michael Levine of LCO, a Los Angeles-based public relations firm.  Watch whether Suleman is close to signing a deal Â» . As reality shows push boundaries to gain viewers, Levine said he understands the interest in a series on the octuplet mom and her family, but adds that he has doubts a deal can be struck because of the liability issues surrounding putting the children on television. \"What was novel three years ago is no longer novel, and I predict craziness to be the order of the day when it comes to reality television,\" he said. Still, he sees the attraction: \"Big families provide a very wonderful context for a lot of conflict and complexity that most people can relate to,\" he said. TLC's O'Neill said there are no plans at this time to have a Suleman show on her network. \"We are watching that story develop at a distance and hoping for the best for that family,\" O'Neill said.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- When Entertainment Weekly published the first trailer of USA Network's new series \"Common Law\" in November on its website, readers were abuzz with excitement. According to the synopsis, the show revolves around two quarreling Los Angeles homicide detectives, played by Warren Kole and Michael Ealy, who are ordered to go to couples therapy. While many were keen to see \"Think Like a Man\" star Ealy again, it appeared that most commenters were sure they would like \"Common Law\" because they knew what to expect. \"Another light-hearted show that is PERFECT on USA,\" one user, Tim Mahoney, said. \"I'll always give a USA Network show a chance and rarely have I been disappointed,\" another user named Kaiulani said. Now, six months later, \"Common Law\" is set to kick off the network's 2012 summer line-up that includes returning shows \"Royal Pains,\" \"Burn Notice,\" \"Suits,\" \"White Collar,\" \"Necessary Roughness\" and \"Covert Affairs.\" The buddy-cop show, which will premiere at 10 p.m. ET Friday, will form a crucial part of USA's annual and popular summer block. The network even claimed that it \"owns summer\" in a recent news release. According to ratings tracker Nielsen, USA averaged 3.61 million viewers in primetime from May 30 to August 21 last year. The newspaper USA Today also reported in January that USA Network had an average of 3.2 million total viewers and remained the top-rated cable network for the sixth consecutive year in 2011. Over the years, this success has largely been attributed to USA's original series, which are often character-driven comedy-dramas that are fun and set in bright and beautiful locations, which have become almost synonymous with destination summer viewing. The 'Characters Welcome' branding . Jon Turteltaub, executive producer of \"Common Law,\" told CNN that the show was originally written to air on CBS, but was picked up by USA because the focus on the detectives' relationship and therapy sessions seemed to be a better fit for them. \"USA does work differently, they push characters over plot,\" he said. \"They were really interested in well-developed and fully drawn characters. For the creators of the show, that's music to our ears.\" Turteltaub said that he sees this priority not necessarily as a formula, but more of \"a guiding principle of things that have worked.\" \"USA has been very clear about not letting the story bog down the tone,\" he said. \"The feel of your show is more important than the police procedural details. If we are loving the characters and feeling a sense of entertainment and fun, then three clues to solve the crime is fine, not five.\" This emphasis is what drew Cory Andrew Barker to USA shows in the first place, so much so that he eventually ended up doing research on the network's programming theme. Barker, who just graduated from Bowling Green State University in Ohio with a master's degree in popular culture, said he was intrigued by how the shows were tonally similar and yet often popular. In his university-approved thesis, \"Genre Welcome?: Formula, Genre and Branding in USA Network's Programming and Promotional Content,\" he explained how the network has carved its own niche. The show that really heralded the network's present style was \"Monk,\" Barker found. When Tony Shalhoub's Adrian Monk, a brilliant detective with obsessive-compulsive disorder, was introduced in the summer of 2002, USA at that time was mostly known for reruns. Barker, who also runs a blog called TV Surveillance, argues that since then, USA has branded itself with its \"Characters Welcome\" slogan to signify its shows' \"quirky, sort of left-of-center\" personalities. These characters tend to work toward \"the greater good\" in ways not always in tandem with the law, have an overarching goal and happen to live in sunny locales. For example, the character of Monk solves crimes with his detailed-oriented abilities, lives in San Francisco and throughout the series is trying to figure out who murdered his wife. This pattern of elements or formula, Barker said, can be found in most of USA's shows, making them recognizable and easy to pick up and consume. So audiences are loyal as they automatically have an idea of what the next USA show will be like and view the network as unique. \"If you are a person who likes USA shows, you will probably like 'Common Law,' \" Barker told CNN. \"You have watched nine shows like these, so why wouldn't I try this?\" Robert Bianco, a TV critic for USA Today, has reviewed several USA Network shows and summarized the cultural perception of the network this way: \"They have a very clever, successful marketing position for themselves, as the home of these 'blue sky,' mostly crime-based dramas with more of a comic twist than you would get on [for instance] FX.\" Blue skies, all season long . The \"blue sky\" that Bianco refers to is the approach or philosophy that USA shows tend to have. The lighter theme is favored over a gloomy or gritty scenario because the objective is not to be overly somber, he said. \"The cable dramas these days have become very serious, and the network procedurals tend to be in the darker side of crimes,\" Bianco said. \"USA shows tend to be glossier, on the sunnier side.\" Jeff Eastin's USA series \"White Collar\" is a good example. The show is about a con man named Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) who, after getting caught by the FBI, helps them solve white-collar crimes using his expertise. Eastin, the show's creator executive producer and show runner, said that since the crimes mostly involve white collar offenses such as art forgery, the lighter elements of the crime are shown and stressed on. \" 'White Collar' ... we're a good prototype show for 'blue sky,' what USA is,\" Eastin said. \"There's a certain classy slickness to the show, just in the general world of police shows ... [It's] pushing for that cleverness [in a] sort of high-end world.\" A part of that slickness also comes from the shows' locations. \"Burn Notice\" is set in Miami, \"Royal Pains\" in the Hamptons, \"Psych\" in Santa Barbara, all of which bring to mind warm weather, beaches and an abundance of sunshine. Eastin said that for the New York City-set \"White Collar,\" there is a tendency to shoot in places where the architecture can be exploited. Barker said that these settings, along with the warm weather timing of the premieres, capture the allure of summer and are all about escapism. \"You are sort of immediately drawn to this place where you might want to take a vacation to,\" he said. Future of USA Network . Many critics have pointed out that despite the likely success, USA's cookie-cutter model for its shows can only go so far and that viewers might tire of similar series. But Bill McGoldrick, USA's executive vice president of original scripted programming, said he doesn't look at it that way. He said that when they go through show pitches, they certainly look for characters that stand out because of their background or relationships. However, McGoldrick added that while the network focuses on a feel that \"puts you in a good mindset\" it is not the motivating factor. \"We definitely stay away from the word 'formula,' he said. \"It's a dirty word here.\" McGoldrick, who worked on \"Monk\" and \"Psych\" early in his career, said that USA, like any other network, is evolving. When \"Monk\" was being developed, network executives at the time were not that interested in serialized character development or just procedurals. \"In those days, we saw that there were not a lot of shows doing throwback, where you could mix comedy and drama,\" McGoldrick said. \"Where you didn't have to be so earnest and serious like 'Law and Order' and 'CSI.' \" After the success of \"Monk\" and the fan-base growth of \"Psych\" and \"Burn Notice,\" McGoldrick said that USA is encouraging its older shows to have continuous and rougher plots and is green lighting new shows such as \"Suits,\" which have more edge. \"Covert Affairs,\" \"Fairly Legal\" and \"Necessary Roughness\" not only deal with more provocative subjects, but also have female leads. USA's political miniseries, \"Political Animals,\" starring Sigourney Weaver as the secretary of state, is set to premiere this July. Bianco said that the new direction might be challenging because the blue sky and escapist vibe might not accurately portray real life -- such as the workings of a law firm in \"Suits\" versus the workings of a law firm like in CBS' \"The Good Wife.\" But he said that there is no need for USA shows to compete with the more serious shows for the fear of becoming too formulaic. \"I don't think there is anything wrong with simple, enjoyable entertainment when you pull it off well,\" Bianco said.",

The pair were handed the bans by UEFA, while Wenger was also fined $14,00, for \"inappropriate language\" towards referee Massimo Busacca following the 3-1 defeat to Barcelona earlier this month. Wenger was enraged by the Swiss official's decision to send off striker Robin van Persie for a second yellow card for kicking the ball away early in the second half. Van Persie was cautioned for taking a shot at goal, just one second after being blown for offside, with the Dutchman protesting that he had not heard the referee's whistle due to the noise of the 95,000 crowd at the Camp Nou stadium. Arsenal eventually lost the tie 4-3 on aggregate and Wenger insisted that he would deny the charge levelled against him. However, the English Premier League club have now decided not to take the matter any further. A statement on the club's official website read: \"Arsenal have decided not to appeal against UEFA bans for Arsene Wenger and Samir Nasri. \"The manager and the midfielder were each suspended for one European match following charges of improper conduct in the wake of Arsenal's Champions League exit at Barcelona.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- It has become a commonplace that it is hard to comprehend the disaster in Haiti. If so, and if we hope to provide Haitians with anything like the help that they need, then we must understand where our minds fail us. One problem that we do not yet face is having our compassion numbed by the sheer magnitude of the calamity. Indeed, it has evoked a deep visceral response, as we see graphic images of individual suffering on a background of mass devastation. When our local tea store is devoting 20 percent of sales to relief and cell phone donations keep pouring in, the scope of the tragedy is mobilizing, not paralyzing. The threat to our compassion comes, rather, from feeling ineffective. We risk that failure if we cannot grasp the realities facing Haiti. Here, we face two deep mental challenges. One is that we must struggle to comprehend how many interdependent threads of Haiti's social fabric have been ripped apart. People lost family, friends and communities in an instant. Children were orphaned in a nation already struggling to care for many orphans. Hospitals, factories and government agencies disappeared. Essential aid organizations lost brave people and resources. Communications and transportation were ruined, including the port that brings almost all goods into the nation. Here, imagining ourselves in the Haitians' plight might help. Can we imagine trying to recover, if our country faced the most massive disaster in its history, without work, food, medicine, transportation, commerce or government? The second challenge is that our minds also struggle to reason quantitatively about events beyond our normal experience. Here, a back-of-the-envelope calculation might help. Assume, plausibly, that everything that 3 million Haitians need must be brought in from outside their country for a period of time. Assume that each Haitian needs 5 pounds of goods per day (food, water, medical supplies, soap, cooking fuel, the gasoline needed to distribute these supplies and more). Assume that everything must be flown in (at least until the port can be reopened). That means 15 million pounds (7,500 tons) of airfreight per day. If a cargo plane can carry 75 tons, then that means 100 flights per day, or one plane landing every 15 minutes, then having its goods unloaded and distributed to victims across the country. One way to understand what those numbers mean is by analogy. The Berlin Airlift was another crisis that required a massive mobilization to supply an isolated population in desperate need. Berlin was cut off by a hostile power, rather than by an ocean. It was devastated by war rather than by an earthquake. Its 2 million citizens needed roughly 5,000 tons of goods per day, delivered through limited entry points, over distances comparable to those of Haiti's island neighbors. The airlift required an unprecedented logistics operation, which Soviet and East German authorities believed impossible. It encountered serious organizational problems in coordinating American forces among themselves and with our allies. It drew resources from other military theaters. It was enormously expensive, in both money and the lives of aviators. In some ways, supplying Haiti is easier. Technology is vastly improved and the world much wealthier. But in other ways, supplying Haiti is even more difficult than the Berlin Airlift. Berlin was occupied territory, under Allied military rule; while Haiti has little functioning government, and those trying to help are struggling to work out their division of labor. If we are not thinking in terms of an effort as massive and risky as the Berlin Airlift, then we have not gotten our minds around the problem. Unless we grasp the complexity and magnitude of the task, then we may be expecting brave, dedicated relief workers to do the impossible -- and be disappointed when they cannot do it all. As a nation, we may fail to support our leaders in providing the sustained resources that the mission requires. If our collective imagination and our sense of history fail us, then we will not achieve the results that our compassion demands -- and will fail Haiti and its people in their long, difficult road to recovery. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Baruch Fischhoff and Kathleen Tierney.",

Navy personnel recover the lifeboat from which Maersk Alabama Capt. Richard Phillips was rescued Sunday. \"They start firing before they climb, with AK-47,\" crew member Zahid Reza said. \"I was scared for my life. I was almost close to that. And they tried to shoot me many times,\" he said, pointing to his head. \"Pointing gun all over.

Rios said he was working on deck when he was called back to lock down the ship. Then, he said, there were gunshots, and an alarm went off to alert all crew members to wake up and get on deck. \"We went to our training,\" he said, declining to provide details: \"If I tell you all what we did, pirates, they would know.\"  Watch the crew praise their captain Â» . The pirates intended to ask for a $3 million ransom, Reza said. He said he and the ship's chief engineer took one of the pirates hostage. Reza said he persuaded the pirate -- whom he described as a young man, maybe 18 or 19 -- to trust him, pointing out that he is Bangladeshi and the pirate was Somali. \"His name is Abdul,\" Reza said. \"I told him, 'Trust me. I am Muslim; you are Muslim.' \" He told Abdul he would take him to the engine room to find more crew members. When they got there, the room was dark, he said, and he didn't know the ship's chief engineer was in there. He said the chief engineer jumped the pirate first, then Reza stabbed him with his knife, and the two men tied the pirate's hands and feet.

    "input": "TOKYO, Japan (CNN) -- Eleven-year-old Hiroki Ando will likely die if he does not get a new heart. Hiroki in an ambulance on the way to catch his flight to New York, where he will wait for a heart. Hiroki suffers from cardiomyopathy, which inflames and impairs the heart. The same disease killed his sister five years ago. \"We have two children in our family who got a disease that happens one out of every 100,000 people. I am sorry for my children. We are having my daughter and Hiroki going through this harsh experience,\" said father Ryuki Ando. \"We were told by his doctor at the end of last year that the heart transplant operation was the only way for him to survive,\" Ando said. But the law in Japan prohibits anyone under the age of 15 from donating organs -- meaning Hiroki can't get a new heart in his home country. According to the web site for Japan Transplant Network, a non-governmental group that supports changing Japan's transplant law, \"this stipulation has greatly reduced the possibility of transplants to small children; heart transplants to small children have become impossible.\"  Watch Hiroki's trip to the United States Â» . Lawmaker Taro Kono is spearheading efforts to change the law, which was enacted in 1997. Japan's parliament is now debating four proposed amendments-- including one that would scrap the age limit. But, beyond the age matter, the issue of organ transplantation in general, has been a difficult one for the country because of perceptions of brain death. Some refuse to accept it if their loved ones' hearts are still beating. \"For a long time, it's the heart that mattered in Japan. Some religions ask us not to declare being brain dead as death. But that is not the majority,\" Kono said. \"So it is simply that we have been doing things this way and a lot of people are very skeptical about it.\" Kono, who gave a kidney to his father, said a total of 81 organ transplants have been conducted in Japan since the transplant law was enacted in 1997, whereas nearly thousands of transplants occur in the United States each year. \"A lot of people in Japan waiting for a transplant, waiting for a liver, a heart, other organs, most of them just die simply because they couldn't get any organs,\" he said. Kono said he believes the public supports changing the law to allow organ donation from children, noting that \"when the parents of the child are going on the street asking for donations, they can actually raise more than a million dollars.\" Incredibly, that's just what Hiroki's family has done. They started a group called \"helping Hiroki\" and raised $1.7 million in donations. \"It was very tough to get the donations, but so many people from all over Japan donated the money,\" he said. \"It was not only the money, but so many letters and messages to energize us, sent to the group. We realized there are so many people supporting us, and they are the reason that we made it this far and will be able to continue after going to the U.S.\" Hiroki is now at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, awaiting a new heart. His father says he knows that the transplant issue is a difficult one for families. \"The honest wish from the recipient's side is to have a donor show up as soon as possible,\" he said, pausing. \"I still do not know whether I can make a decision to give my child's heart to someone else if I am faced with such a situation. But unless the people face the issue and think about it seriously, I do not think the time will come soon to see more people volunteering to donate organs.\" Ando said he hopes that one day he will be able to play baseball with his son, who is an avid sports fan. \"I would like to have a fun time again with Hiroki. I would like to make it home with everyone in good health,\" he said. \"That's the biggest hope I have now.\" Ando's mother wrote in a blog on her Web site (http://www.hirokikun.jp/) that Hiroki was high on the waiting list for a heart transplant in New York. \"I believe Hiroki will be all right,\" she wrote.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Lewis Pugh was standing in the Arctic in a Speedo about to plunge into water just shy of the freezing point when he came to grips with the challenge he was facing. \"My most dominant thought as I was standing on the edge of the sea ice,\" Pugh said, \"was just how frightened I was. The water's completely black; there are chunks of white ice in the water.\" Pugh said he remembered thinking that if things went wrong, \"How long would it take for my frozen body to sink to the bottom of the ocean?\" Pugh didn't sink, and he completed a one-kilometer swim in 29-degree Fahrenheit (or -1.7 degree centigrade) water. (Since it was salt water it was below the normal freezing point of water.) But it came at a price. He lost feeling in his hands for four months. Watch an interview with Lewis Pugh . Pugh, a 40-year-old former reservist in Britain's special forces regiment, the Special Air Service, has gained worldwide attention for his extreme adventures, designed to dramatize the environmental threats to the planet. Whether it's swimming at the North Pole, or in a meltwater lake on Mount Everest, Pugh is constantly testing his own limits and calling attention to urgent issues. \"Swimming has been a very effective medium for telling a story about the state of our planet,\" Pugh told CNN. TED.com: Ben Saunders skis to the North Pole . The son of an admiral in the British navy, Pugh and his family moved to South Africa when he was 10. Educated there and at Cambridge University, Pugh became a maritime lawyer but grew dissatisfied with the profession. A friend said to him, \"Lewis, if you don't follow your own dreams in life, then you're going to be following somebody's else's dreams.\" TED.com: John Wooden on true success . Swimming is his dream. His adventures have taken him to every ocean and many other bodies of water; swimming Norway's longest fjord, swimming the English Channel, swimming in the Maldives in the Indian Ocean, swimming the full length of the River Thames, swimming from Robben Island to Cape Town. \"I want to swim until the last day of my life,\" Pugh says. Pugh says he was driven to attempt record-setting coldwater swims because the warm-water swimming challenges had already been conquered. He doesn't think that his ability to survive cold-water swimming adventures is due to any physical advantage over others, but rather to a resolve never to give up. As he was about to dive into the Arctic, he says, that mental attitude came into play. \"The most immediate thing you have to do is to just squeeze out the fear, because otherwise the fear will just paralyze you. And then commit 100 percent.... I wanted to swim a kilometer across the North Pole. And I wanted to do it to demonstrate graphically to the world what was happening in the Arctic, because the North Pole should be frozen over. TED.com: Aimee Mullins on running . \"I remember thinking to myself, if things go bad, I'll get out after 500 meters...if you think about a swim like that, that's the worst way of thinking. What you're doing is confusing your subconscious, because you're planning for victory and defeat at the same time. \"So the only way I could get into that water was to get as aggressive as possible -- not wild aggression, controlled aggression -- and to get really focused, and then commit 100 percent to doing the full kilometer and then just dive in, go for it. \"It took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds, it was just grueling, make no bones about it. The human body is not designed for swimming in minus 1.7 degree centigrade water. The passengers of the Titanic perished in water of 5 degrees centigrade. So this water is 7 degrees centigrade colder. It's very grueling on the body, and afterward when I came out, my fingers were swollen. \"We're made partially of water, so the cells in my fingers had actually frozen and expanded and burst. It damaged the nerve cells, it took me four months to feel my fingers again, but now everything's fine. \"But the more lasting damage is the psychological impact it has on you because if you haven't felt your hands for four months, you are cautious about going and pushing the boundaries again.\" Yet Pugh didn't let that stop him. In May, two and a half years after the Arctic swim, he was on Mount Everest, swimming in rarefied air at a high altitude. \"One of the hardest things was to get back in water which was very, very cold, and at 5.5 kilometers above sea level.\" Given the physical damage he suffered after the North Pole swim, Pugh says he \"had to work hard on putting that swim behind me, forgetting about it, and starting with a fresh clean slate.\" \"It's almost like when a computer's got a virus, you clean that hard drive... that's what I had to do in my mind, clean my mind.\" In the SAS, the special forces, he said, there is a saying that its initials stand for \"speed, aggression, surprise.\" He adopted that approach in the world of coldwater swimming, swimming as fast as he could, with as much adrenalin as possible, to \"fend off the cold.\" It didn't work in the high-altitude conditions of Mt. Everest. \"You can't bully Mt .Everest, it's very difficult to breathe up there...So I had to adopt a much calmer approach, one with a lot of humility, and I had to work with the mountain rather than against the mountain.\" Pugh swam more slowly, using the breaststroke, and completed the kilometer in just under 23 minutes. [In more normal water conditions, he swims a kilometer in about 14 minutes.] . Pugh says his father and mother, who was a nursing officer in the British navy, set an example of persistence. \"Those people from that generation were not quitters.\" \"I just never, ever want to give up.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Fans of Usher Raymond IV view him as a singing, dancing and acting superstar. Superstar performer Usher Raymond IV at the closing ceremony for Usher's Camp New Look. But to a special group of young people, he is a mentor and a friend. \"He leads by example,\" said Arnold \"Supa\" LaFrance, a \"Mogul in Training\" at Usher's Camp New Look. \"Usher's all about peace and love and giving back to the community, and it's genuine. He does it when the cameras are on and when the cameras are off.\" Now in its fifth year, the camp is a passion for the Grammy Award-winning artist, who each year gives more than a hundred teens from underserved communities across the country the opportunity to learn about the entertainment and sports industries. Thomas Springer, a 17-year-old Atlanta, Georgia, resident, has participated in the camp for four years and said he wants to use his talent in filmmaking and what he has learned at Camp New Look to help his community. \"Before I came to camp, I didn't think I had a voice in my community and that I could do anything based on my age,\" Springer said. \"The camp let me know that no matter what your age, no matter what you do, you can make an impact on your community.\" Usher came to fame as a teen and has sold millions of records, including the hit singles \"Yeah\" and \"Confessions II.\" His success has allowed him to become part owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers basketball team and to launch his own line of fragrances for men and women. The camp, the singer said, teaches participants the business aspects of the entertainment and sports industries and imparts the importance of being service-oriented. A selection committee selects campers that are nominated by partner organizations in various cities across the country. Now the father of two young boys, Usher said he is also enriched by the camp's experience. \"It makes me a better man. It makes me a better individual,\" he said. \"There's a difference between hard work and heart work, and this would represent heart work.\"  Watch Usher talk about his camp Â» . As a youngster, Usher participated in the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and he said it helped shape his ideas about mentoring. \"I think that the Boys & Girls Club is a very positive environment for kids,\" he said. \"It's another place that allows you to be a product of your experience. I encountered a lot of people who became mentors for me there.\" At this year's closing ceremony for Usher's Camp New Look, held at the Alliance Theater at Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta, the energy level was high as campers and their family members walked a red carpet alongside some of Usher's celebrity friends, including NBA star Alonzo Mourning and San Francisco 49er Allen Rossum. The free, residential camp held for two weeks every summer in Atlanta is an outgrowth of Usher's New Look Foundation, which he established to empower at-risk youth by giving them the skills necessary to enter careers in the sports and entertainment industries and working with them to provide employment opportunities. Mourning said Usher is one who understands that \"to whom much is given, much is required.\" \"The service that Usher is providing for these kids with these educational opportunities and expanding their lives to a whole new level, it's important that we all rally around these particular causes and support these initiatives,\" Mourning said. Gabrielle Brou, 16, a first-year camper from Ocean Springs, Mississippi, who aspires to be an actress, said there were countless opportunities at camp to network with successful people who are living the lives she hopes to achieve. \"Once I found out that there were ways I could better myself in acting, learn the business and also give back ... I decided that this camp would be really great for me,\" she said. \"I would love to do it again next year.\" Having a day set aside for the campers and their families to revel in all that they have achieved and their future possibilities left Usher with a huge smile on his face. \"It's really good to see them be able to live out their dreams,\" he said.",

    "input": "New York (CNN) -- Tropical Storm Irene's swipe at the Big Apple proved Sunday that New Yorkers can be a tough crowd to impress. \"I slept through the whole thing,\" said James Trager, a writer who watched nature's display of fury as it took place outside the windows of his apartment in Midtown and gave a tepid review: \"Nothing. It's exaggerated.\" \"I think we're all surprised how relatively quickly the storm blew through here and the rain stopped,\" said Steve Kastenbaum, a national correspondent for CNN radio, who watched the storm from the comfort of his apartment in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn. He said he saw lots of local street flooding and branches in the streets, but few uprooted trees; during the height of the storm, people were walking on the street. \"I even saw one or two folks taking a jog,\" he said. \"I kid you not. Pretty typical for Brooklyn. They're not going to let anybody get in their way.\" While the initial effects of the storm were less harsh than anticipated, officials said they were still concerned about flooding from heavy rains that could affect electrical systems and other infrastructure that is largely underground in New York. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said it was not yet clear when subways, Metro North trains and Long Island Railroad lines would reopen. \"The conditions are still too dangerous. We can't put people on bridges; we can't put people in tunnels,\" he told CNN affiliate WCBS. \"Once we get a full assessment, we will give people an idea of when the system will come online.\" He praised New Yorkers for taking the storm in stride. \"When we have our darkest hours, New Yorkers shine their brightest, and I think this is one of those times.\" But the possibility of worse occurring away from the shore was weighing on National Hurricane Center Director Bill Read. \"The biggest concern, now that (Irene's) gone inland, is heavy rain, flash floods\" and wind damage, he told CNN. Once inland, hurricanes \"start falling apart pretty fast,\" he said. \"Eventually, it will exit out into Canada.\" \"Overall, I think we've gotten through this,\" Joseph Bruno, commissioner of emergency management for the city, told reporters in Brooklyn, where the skies were bright. He said the hardest-hit areas were from Coney Island in Brooklyn to the Rockaway area of Queens. \"We have 50,000 people without power. That's pretty good in a city of this size. So, we did well, but we prepared well, also.\" \"Nothing really that bad happened,\" said Sarah Sargenti, who spent Saturday night in a friend's walkup apartment in Soho rather than risk getting stuck without elevator service in her 23rd-floor apartment near the financial district. \"A lot of wind and rain.\" Lt. Gen. Russel Honore, a CNN contributor who was involved in a leadership role in the recovery efforts in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, described Sunday's hurricane as a six out of 10, with 10 representing Katrina. About 30 miles north of the city, in Westchester County's Sleepy Hollow, near the Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson, Tom Sobolik was out early Sunday at the Philipse Manor Beach Club. Though the bridge was shut to traffic, \"the boats here are all fine,\" the photographer said. \"Nobody had any problem.\" On Saturday night, he attended a hurricane party in his neighborhood to discuss the brewing storm. \"Everybody just went over how they prepared and how it was going to be a waste,\" he said. \"It turned out to be largely true. The media blew this all out of proportion.\" It did not flood the 9/11 memorial site in Manhattan, as many had worried it might. Still, the storm left quite a wake -- sending water from the East River and the Hudson River over their banks for a brief period on Sunday morning and into New York City. The water also led officials to close for a brief time the north tube of the Holland Tunnel, from Lower Manhattan to New Jersey. Earlier, authorities had halted public transportation, closed bridges and tunnels and buttoned up ports, essentially locking down the city of more than 8 million people as Hurricane Irene began to lash the city with wind and rain. And New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg urged some 370,000 people to evacuate their residences in low-lying areas. In the Long Island community of Long Beach, massive berms were breached by 8 a.m., with water pushing northward into town. The water yanked a lifeguard building from its foundation on the beach and streets were flooded. Bloomberg ordered evacuations for Long Beach Island, including Atlantic Beach, Lido Beach and Point Lookout. The mandatory evacuations, which also affected parts of Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Staten Island, were a first in the city's history, he said. CNN iReporter and Queens resident Anne Egan, who was watching events unfold from her house three doors down from the beach wall, said she disregarded the evacuation order because she was afraid of looters. \"You can see the waves breaking on (the beach wall),\" she said. \"I was a little panicked approaching high tide, which was about 7:30 a.m. But now that the peak of high tide has passed us, I'm not as nervous. The waves are just huge out there.\" More than 905,334 people were without power in New York early Sunday afternoon, authorities said. In Brooklyn, Seunh Hong watched in despair as the water in his shop's basement rose to his knees. \"Way worse than I'd expected,\" he said. \"It is absolutely horrible. Afterwards we have to spend lot of time and money, (and) energy for fixing them up.\" Many in New York began preparing days ago for the arrival of Irene, stocking up on essentials. By late Saturday, most stores, restaurants and bars were closed. The bread shelves were bare early Sunday at the Associated Supermarket on Manhattan's Upper West Side, according to Aaron Herman, who said more than 1,000 people had stopped in Saturday to buy the \"essentials.\" By then, the streets were largely deserted. \"For a city that never sleeps, it's clearly taking a nap,\" Herman said. CNN's Tom Watkins, Chelsea J. Carter, Holly Yan, Phil Gast, Eden Pontz, Kristina Sgueglia, Jesse Solomon, Cheryl Robinson, Rob Marciano, and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.",

The bridge is estimated to cost around $950 million, and should help create as many as 10,000 jobs in Michigan alone, according to the office of Gov. Rick Snyder. The project includes the bridge, Canadian and U.S. inspection plazas and an interchange with Interstate 75, according to the office of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. It will be funded by Canada and is expected to take four or five years to complete. \"Our government is taking the measures necessary to facilitate trade and investment between Canada and the United States in order to generate jobs, economic growth and long term prosperity,\" Harper said in the statement. \"This new bridge will reduce congestion at this critical Canada-U.S. border crossing, support the creation of new export-related jobs and investment opportunities along the Quebec City-Windsor corridor, increase the competitiveness of the North American manufacturing sector, and provide thousands of construction jobs in Ontario and Michigan,\" he added. Harper appeared at an afternoon news conference, alongside Snyder and U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. It will be the second to span the Detroit River. The existing bridge is the busiest trade crossing on the U.S.-Canada border, serving about 8,000 trucks each day, Snyder said. \"It's time for a new crossing. It's time because trade demands it. It's an opportunity to create jobs, and we can work on something exciting,\" the governor said.",

Eddie Murphy, at the Academy Awards in February, is the father of Spice Girl Melanie Brown's baby. A brief statement issued by Murphy's publicist said the 46-year-old star of \"Dreamgirls\" and the \"Beverly Hills Cop\" movies \"always has and will continue to honor his responsibilities as a father.\" \"Mr. Murphy and Ms. Brown dated very briefly and never made any plans of ANY sort,\" the statement said. \"He acknowledges paternity of the child Angel, and has paid child support to Ms. Brown as well as covering the expenses of her pregnancy.\" The statement concluded by saying Murphy \"views this as a private matter, and as such, will not be making any further comments about it.\" Murphy had never publicly acknowledged paternity before. Brown filed suit against Murphy in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday, seeking to legally establish his paternity and seeking unspecified child support for the 3-month-old girl. A DNA test in June confirmed that Murphy is the father of Brown's baby, Angel Iris Murphy Brown, who was born in April. The couple dated last year and Brown, 32, known as Scary Spice as a member of the British pop phenomenon, listed Murphy as the father on the child's birth certificate. Celebrity magazines reported this week that Murphy had become engaged to his girlfriend of 10 months, Tracey Edmonds. Murphy has five children from his first marriage to Nicole Mitchell, which ended in divorce in April 2006. The Spice Girls announced in June they would be reuniting for a world tour starting in December.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Two American tourists who were kidnapped in the southern part of Egypt's Sinai Peninsula were freed Friday, a security official said. They had been abducted by unknown Bedouins, said Gen. Mohamed Naguib, head of security in the region. The kidnappers had demanded that some detainees be released and retried, but it is unclear if these calls were met. Earlier Friday, the country's tourism minister said on Al Hayat Egyptian TV that authorities had located the kidnappers and were negotiating with them. The abductions came several days after kidnappers held a larger group for a day. Twenty-four Chinese workers and a translator were kidnapped by Bedouins while on their way to a military-owned cement factory on Tuesday, the state-run Xinhua news agency of China reported. A group of armed Bedouins had blocked the road on which they were traveling. They wanted the Egyptian government to release prisoners. The hostages were released after a day, the news agency said, after Egyptian authorities intervened. Kidnappings and daylight armed robberies have become increasingly common in the turbulent year since Egypt's long-ruling dictator Hosni Mubarak was overthrown. In particular, wealthy Egyptians have been targeted by hostage-takers demanding ransom. \"Two of our family members, Ismail, (age) 13 and Sara, 8, were kidnapped yesterday. Right after they got out of their house ... on their way to school,\" said Mamdouh Eid, an executive in a construction company and the executive director of the Fan's Committee for the popular Egyptian soccer team Al Ahly. Eid revealed news of the kidnapping of his family, during an interview with CNN about the rampage in a Port Said football stadium that left at least 79 people dead. Hours after he survived the deadly incident, Eid said he learned of the kidnapping of his two child cousins. \"Thankfully, we got them back last night,\" he said. He declined to explain how the children were returned to their parents. \"Its scary. We don't know what we're heading to and if it will ever be the same again.\"",

She could be executed if convicted. It's a case that has gripped America. George and Cindy Anthony, parents of murder suspect Casey Anthony, on \"Larry King Live\" Wednesday. George and Cindy Anthony answered their critics in an exclusive interview on \"Larry King Live\" Wednesday night. Appearing with their lawyer, Brad Conway, they talked about whether they still support their daughter completely and what their lives have been like under the media glare. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: . Larry King: We are amazed because we've received -- get this -- thousands of blog responses to your appearance here tonight. And, honestly, most of them are critical. Why do you think people are angry at you? Cindy Anthony: Because they don't understand. They've never been in our shoes. So a lot of people, especially bloggers, ... like to pick things apart. And, you know, we're a target. King: But what are they picking apart? Cindy Anthony: They're picking apart the fact that we're standing behind our daughter. They're picking apart the fact that we are trying to make something out of Caylee's tragedy. King: Do you talk to Casey a lot? Cindy Anthony: I haven't spoken to Casey in person since October the 14th. We write. King: Why not? Cindy Anthony: Because every time we go to the jail to see her, it's videotaped and then it's all over \"Nancy Grace\" and, you know, the six o'clock news. King: How do you explain the body being found so close to home? Cindy Anthony: I can't explain it. I don't know if anybody can right now.  Watch how Anthonys cope with granddaughter's death, daughter's incarceration Â» . King: But you have thoughts, don't you, George? George Anthony: Well, I mean there's so many things I really would like to know, but there's a lot of things I just don't know. King: But you've got to ask. George Anthony: I wish I had an opportunity to talk to my daughter. But, again, we don't have that chance. King: But logically, if she's not involved, what could be said that could harm her? Cindy Anthony: You know, people pick everything apart. If Casey cries, she's not crying enough. If she smiles at us like she did in court the first time she saw us, then she's smiling for the wrong reasons. King: [Caylee's] body is stuffed in a laundry bag. The skull is wrapped in duct tape. Could you imagine your daughter would do that? Cindy Anthony: No. Attorney Brad Conway: The duct tape probably was not wrapped around the skull. We know that there was no flesh and no hair attached to the duct tape, yet that's what goes out in the media and that's what people assume to be true. And that's the unfair part: This young lady has not had her opportunity in court, yet people have drawn conclusions from discovery that's out there. King: Cindy, the meter reader who found the body alerted the authorities as far back as August about a suspicious bag. This tip wasn't acted on. Do you think there would be any difference if the body were found earlier? Cindy Anthony: I'm sure there would be, if she was really there back in August. I'm not convinced of that yet. King: Are you trying to find a murderer? I mean do you have a private detective? Cindy Anthony: We have a private investigator who's still investigating Caylee's disappearance. The defense has private investigators. And we're leaving them to their job. King: Brad, is this a rock and a hard place [for George and Cindy Anthony]? Conway: It is. What the Anthonys are trying to do is deal with the grief of the loss of their granddaughter while trying to help other people out. And, unfortunately, there are going to be a lot of people that go through what they go through. The only way to take a negative thing and make a positive is share their grief publicly and let people know that it's OK to do this. King: The Anthonys have written a Web exclusive [for CNN] responding to their critics. You won't see it anywhere else. See the Anthonys' blog and comments from readers . King: Did you ever try to harm yourself? Cindy Anthony: I wrote suicide notes, but I never acted on it. King: Because? Cindy Anthony: You know, when you are away from someone and something is ripped out of your life so suddenly ... Imagine a child -- not having that child around. And, weeks into it, not knowing where she was and what had happened to her was devastating. It was hard to get up in the morning and, you know, go on with your day. King: What stopped you? Cindy Anthony: My faith. You know, I knew that's not the right thing to do. King: Do you completely believe she didn't do it? Cindy Anthony: Yes, I do. King: Completely? Cindy Anthony: Yes. I see the love in Casey's eyes. Every single picture that you see of Caylee and Casey together, you can see the love in their eyes. King: Cindy, you were the first to call authorities last July to say you hadn't seen Caylee for a month and that your daughter's car smelled like it had a dead body in it. Didn't you worry that that would be kind of presumptive from the state to make a case out this? Cindy Anthony: You know, Larry, on July 15th, all I wanted was the police department out to my house out to help me look for Caylee. King: Did you smell the smell? Cindy Anthony: I smelled a smell in the car. I smelled it in my refrigerator with sour food. King: Do you have any idea why [Casey] didn't call police all the time her daughter was missing? Cindy Anthony: I can't answer that. Casey was probably grieving as best as she could. It doesn't make her guilty. King: No, but weird. Cindy Anthony: It doesn't make her guilty. Yes, but a lot of people do weird things under stress, under tragedy. So it doesn't make you guilty. King: Would you favor that whoever did this crime should face the death penalty? Cindy Anthony: You know, I'm not a fan of the death penalty for anybody. King: George? George Anthony: I'm opposed to it. King: Let's take a call. Caller: I have a question for the Anthonys. What will they do if their daughter is found guilty? Will they still support her or will they cut all ties? Cindy Anthony: I can't cut tie from my own flesh and blood, so no. King: Do you expect to testify, George? George Anthony: I'm sure we'll be in court when everything comes, probably sometime next year. King: Do you think they'll be called, Brad, both? Conway: Yes, sir, they will. Another caller: Where do you find the strength to support your daughter when everyone seems to be against her?

Diane Schuler's minivan was heading the wrong direction as the wreck happened, police said. \"I have looked at the autopsy, and the pancreas, liver and esophagus were clear,\" Tom Ruskin, lead investigator and president of CMP Protective and Investigative Group, told CNN. \"I've never seen a case like this. No one has seen this woman drunk and we have interviewed over 50 people -- relatives, friends, colleagues and former employees from her company.\" The Westchester County medical examiner's office found that Diane Schuler, 36, had a blood alcohol level of .19 percent -- more than twice the legal limit -- and had marijuana in her system when she drove a minivan the wrong way on the Taconic State Parkway and ran head-on into an SUV. Three adults in the SUV were killed in the July 26 crash, along with Schuler and four children in her minivan -- her daughter and three nieces. A fifth child, Schuler's son, survived and is in stable condition. Ruskin, a former officer in New York Police's narcotics division, said he is hesitant to fully accept the autopsy report. \"I'm not saying the autopsy is wrong or right.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Iraq is today a shattered society, shaped by two major international wars, bombings, debilitating sanctions, civil war, emigration of millions of its best-educated people, deadly insurgency and counterinsurgency and foreign occupation over 20 years. While Iraq never achieved full unity after it was cobbled together by the British in 1920 from three large and mutually alien communities -- the Sunni Muslim Kurds in the northern highlands, the Sunni Muslim Arabs in the central plains and the partly Farsi-speaking Shia Muslim Arabs in the southern lowlands -- Iraq had made great social and economic progress. By 1990, it was the most advanced of the Arab countries. Now that is all gone. Yet, even today, there is a memory of collective statehood, or Iraqiyah. Some of us who have lived among the Iraqis believe they have a chance to invigorate a new beginning of Iraqiyah but that the return to something like the state that existed before will take years. How is the American withdrawal regarded? My hunch, from having known Iraq and Iraqis of all persuasions for more than half a century, is that most will be happy to see us leave. But, at the same time, they have learned to fear one another, so their politically effective attitudes will vary from one community to the next. Insofar as there are winners from these destructive years, it is the Shiites. With our help, they emerged to control the government and such armed forces as exist. Most of their leaders have lived and studied in Iranian theological institutions, so they see Iran as a friend and patron. More recently, they have made beneficial economic and diplomatic contact with China, Russia, India and members of the European Union. Thus, while the (Shia) Iraqi government realizes that the United States (inadvertently) helped them to power, that time is past, and an anti-Iranian America could pose dangers. Better, they would conclude, that America be gone. For the Kurds, the answer is different. They have benefited from the destruction of the Sunni Arab central government to establish a vigorous mini-state under the Kurdistan Regional Government. The Shia Iraqi regime is unlikely to challenge Kurdish autonomy. And if it manages to keep the giant oil field at Kirkuk, the Kurdistan Regional Government could underwrite its autonomy economically. But, with the Americans gone, the Kurdistan Regional Government faces one danger: their people, as distinct from their state, spill over into Syria, Iran and Turkey. Revanchist movements of Kurds in those countries have brought upon the Kurdistan Regional Government attacks and may bring more severe attacks once the American hand is withdrawn. Thus, the Kurdistan Regional Government should favor at least a strong American influence in their neighborhood. The Sunni Arabs have been the big losers in this long and dreadful conflict. A whole generation of their educated elite have fled the country, tens of thousands have been killed, hundreds of thousands wounded. Most of their property has been looted, seized or burned. The dangers posed by the Shiites are still clear and present. Surely, one would think, despite the memory of the American role in these events, they would like the Americans to stay to prevent the Shiites from further action against them. No, I find that is not true. They, above all other Iraqis, were the nationalists, raised on efforts to eject the British and then to overthrow the British puppets; for them, getting rid of foreign manipulation was always the ultimate objective. So, although they might hope that America's hostility to Iran would spill over into Iraq to their advantage, they share with the Shiites and the Kurds satisfaction that the Americans are nearly gone. But are the Americans really nearly gone? Are any of the hopes or beliefs of the Iraqis likely to be fulfilled? The U.S. is reportedly doubling the size of its embassy personnel from 8,000 to 16,000, with about 200 military personnel remaining to assist them. So long as hostility to Iran remains the governing policy in the Middle East, Iraq remains pivotal. The same geostrategic appreciation, but focused on India and the Gulf oil states, governed British policy in the 1930s and 1940s. There is no sign the basic policy has changed by the move from London to Washington. While at least the more abrasive aspects of the American presence in Iraq are likely to diminish, I believe that in the eyes of all three groups of Iraqis, the withdrawal will be regarded as cosmetic rather than real. In this event, it seems likely that the current friction among at least America, the Sunni Arab rebels and the Shia government will not abate much while the Kurds will continue to cultivate their close but covert relationship with Israel. And if America's relationship with Iran worsens, the Kurds and Americans will draw closer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of William R. Polk.",

    "input": "Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Two Nigerian labor groups suspended their nationwide strike Monday over the elimination of the country's fuel subsidy and urged demonstrators to go home \"in order to save lives and in the interest of national survival. The Nigeria Labour Congress and the Trade Union Congress cited successes gained by demonstrators, including an announcement Monday by President Goodluck Jonathan slashing fuel prices, in its announcement suspending the strikes. \"In the past eight days through strikes, mass rallies, shutdown, debates and street protests, Nigerians demonstrated clearly that they cannot be taken for granted and that sovereignty belongs to them,\" NLC President Abdulwahed Omar and Peter Esele, president of the Trade Union Congress, said in the statement. But a third organization, the Joint Action Front, issued a statement deploring the suspension and urging continued strikes and protests until the government agrees to restore gas prices to what they were before the government ended the subsidy. \"Nigerians should not be discouraged by the abrupt and unwarranted suspension of strike by its Labour partner; neither should the militarization of the protest centers deter Nigerians in their resolve to rid the polity of this class of looters and profiteers that are responsible for mass poverty, unemployment, social insecurity and untold hardships of the majority of Nigerians,\" JAF Secretary Abiodun Aremu said in the statement. In an earlier statement on the group's blog, Aremu said the group and a related organization, the Labor and Civil Society Coalition, had decided Sunday that they would continue their strikes and mass protests after talks with the government failed. \"However early this morning, our joint leadership advised Nigerians to continue the strike but (said they) should stay at home in view of the resolve by the Federal Government to unleash violence on Nigerians who want to exercise their right to protest and procession,\" Aremu said in the statement. The Joint Action Front is part of the National Labour Congress and has organized many of the protests and rallies against the government's decision to end the fuel subsidy. On Monday, the government deployed troops in Lagos, and military forces set up armed checkpoints at most key bridges and along major roads. Eyewitnesses told CNN that police and the army were not allowing protesters into demonstration zones, but there were no confirmed reports of violence. Scattered demonstrations began in Nigeria after Jonathan announced on January 1 that the government would end the popular fuel subsidy, which was widely seen by citizens as one of the few perks of living in the oil-rich but largely impoverished nation of more than 160 million people. The government has said the removal of subsidies would free up billions of dollars to boost the economy and improve the country's infrastructure. The removal caused the price of fuel and other goods to spike and became a rallying point for Nigerians angry over corruption and the alleged misuse of oil revenues in a country where most citizens battle grinding poverty. Fuel that had cost about 65 nairas (40 cents) before the subsidy was lifted rose to 141 nairas (86 cents). On Monday, after more than a week of protests, Jonathan announced in a speech that the government would reduce fuel prices to 97 nairas (60 cents) per liter. He cited \"the hardships being suffered by Nigerians.\" Aremu rejected the Nigerian government's concession and said his group would only accept a return to prices before the government cut the fuel subsidy. \"The people have every right to tell the presidency and this class of looters and profiteers that Nigeria belongs to Nigerians,\" Aremu said. It was unclear Monday whether the Nigeria Labour Congress or the Trade Union Congress would accept the fuel-price cut and call for a permanent end to the strikes and protests. Last week, a major oil union, Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, had threatened to halt production in solidarity with protesters if the two sides didn't reach an agreement. A move to halt production would reverberate on the global market. Nigeria is the world's eighth-largest crude exporter. Charlie Robertson, a chief economist at the global investment firm Renaissance Capital, said earlier this month that a subsidy removal could help Nigeria in the future. \"If they're prepared to try this petroleum subsidy removal then perhaps they can push through electricity reform, too. If they do that, Nigeria's growth can be, instead of 7%-8% a year, 10% or 11%,\" Robertson said. But there is a widespread lack of trust in the government to provide the infrastructure; Nigeria is regularly ranked among the most corrupt countries in the world. Finance Minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said Nigerians should not let the past determine the future. She said the goal now is to regain the citizens' trust and move forward. \"They cannot say because of mistakes in the past the country should not move forward,\" she said. CNN's Brian Walker contributed to this report .",

    "input": "(CNN) -- In the age of digital audio, what does good old-fashioned radio still have to offer? Teca Lima, the voice of RadarCultura, consults the Web site before talking into the mic. Plenty, according to the creators of RadarCultura, a community-based Web site and a daily three-hour AM radio program broadcast from Brazil's SÃ£o Paulo. \"Radio is 'now,'\" says 22-year-old Brazilian AndrÃ© Avorio, who implemented the Web site. \"[Radio] is generally quick and live. This adds a special dynamic to the medium. Moreover, it is still one of the most popular means of mass communication in Brazil. Combining it with the power of the Internet can result in many new possibilities.\" RadarCultura is an experimental project of the Padre Anchieta Foundation to promote public participation in audio-visual programming, eventually aiming to fuse its radio, television and Web programs into a single interactive, real-time platform. Like many online music sites, RadarCultura is always looking for new music and emerging talents, but its primary focus is to preserve the memory of the Brazilian repertoire by resurfacing classic, forgotten or unknown songs. The Padre Anchieta Foundation also happens to boast the biggest archive of Brazilian music in Brazil, including more than 15,000 songs dating from the 1920's to the present. \"Making it easy to search through the vast archive of songs was an important feature since version one of the Web site,\" says Avorio. Producer Alceu Maynard observes two types of RadarCultura members: \"There are people who listen to the show because they are fans of Brazilian music. There are others who like to produce the content on our site -- they collaborate actively with suggestions, playlists and all aspects of programming.\" Meanwhile, RadarCultura team members Alceu, speaker Teca Lima and project manager Lia Rangel are busy podcasting interviews, moderating conversations, blogging, twittering and keeping the site relevant. Old media gets new blood . True to its non-visual origin, RadarCultura's Web site is strictly text-based, with icons that link to votes and streaming audio. And true to its Web-based platform, the site has adopted, and adapted, all Net-native systems for its daily operations. The site itself runs on the free Drupal content-management system, which allows content to rank and flow according to input and feedback from the site's online community. Members who wish to contribute their own audio material to RadarCultura's archive must either podcast it themselves first, or else they may upload it to the U.S.-based Archive.org to clear it of online rights. Given the quantity of music aired from the ever-expanding repertoire, copyright issues are the most common pretext to negotiation, most notably with ECAD, a privately owned civil society for the collection and distribution of copyright managed by 10 Brazilian music associations. Online, however, RadarCultura distributes the entirety of its streaming content under a Creative Commons license. The team has also been experimenting with the free CoveritLive software to enable live blogging, chatting and Twittering among audience, presenters and guests during its online coverage of radio and TV events, including the popular Roda Vivo TV show. RadarCultura's first live event coverage in February 2008 was of Campus Party Brasil, a seven-day tech-fest that saw people camping out in tents with broadband cables while sharing ideas and technological innovations. In April 2008, RadarCultura struck again with its live coverage of Virada Cultural, Brazil's largest cultural event, including art performances and exhibits in the streets of SÃ£o Paulo during 24 continuous hours, attracting some 4 million people. \"I came up with the idea of inviting the audience to report directly from the streets using their mobile phones,\" says Avorio. \"A telephone system was installed, and the calls from the participants were automatically recorded. Our non-stop production team listened to every recording as they arrived and not only immediately published them online but geo-localized them on an interactive map of SÃ£o Paulo. \"It was RadarCultura's first truly collaborative coverage, as the audience produced most of the interviews and reviews, of not only the main attractions of Virada Cultural, but also the very obscure ones that otherwise would not be covered by the mainstream media.\" Next: Music for the masses, on demand . But still much remains to be done with RadarCultura's original content -- music. \"Due to legal restrictions, it has been very difficult to exploit many of the possibilities previously imagined for the RadarCultura Web site, like listening online to playlists or to the thousands of songs in the archive,\" Avorio reflects. \"Live radio has been a great success and will remain so for a long time, but it is now clear the value of on-demand content -- whenever you want it, wherever you are, on whatever device you have handy -- from the iPod to your mobile phone.\" RadarCultura's Web site not only introduces Brazilian music and culture to the international online community, it brings its programming well beyond the limited broadcasting range of the station's native SÃ£o Paulo to the rest of Brazil. In a nation notorious for violence rooted in social inequality, the democracy of the Web -- not unlike radio -- is a welcome new medium of communication. \"Certainly SÃ£o Paulo is the most 'wired' city in the country, but the Internet and the possibilities associated with it have reached the most distant towns,\" says Avorio. \"It is amazing the value that such a technology delivers to a country in a fast development pace such as Brazil -- from education to more subtle ways of social inclusion.\" For Gioconda Bordon, Padre Anchieta Foundation's radio coordinator, RadarCultura's most memorable moment took place on December 17, 2008, when the program celebrated its first anniversary. \"We had here in our studio the great composer Tom ZÃ©, a very well-known musician, singing and talking live with a very young singer, Mallu MagalhÃ£es, a teenager, actually,\" she recalls. \"The listeners were as happy as we were and, of course, as moved as the two artists were. It was a day in our history.\"",

Some of the plaintiffs led female troops who went on missions with combat infantrymen, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which is representing the women. \"Their careers and opportunities have been limited by a policy that does not grant them the same recognition for their service as their male counterparts,\" the ACLU said. \"The combat exclusion policy also makes it harder for them to do their jobs.\" Air National Guard search-and-rescue helicopter pilot Maj. Mary Jennings Hegar flew medevac missions in Afghanistan. While she was rescuing three injured soldiers, she and her crew were shot down and forced to engaged in combat, according to the ACLU. Hegar suffered shrapnel wounds, and she was later awarded the Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor, the ACLU said. She returned to flying status within a week. Despite that, the combat exclusion policy prevents her from seeking some combat leadership positions, the ACLU said. An IED took a veteran's leg, not her fighting spirit . Hegar said serving has very little to do with gender, and that the military's policy is \"an injustice to women who have come before us and who continue to put their lives on the line for their country.\" She wanted to be an Air Force pilot since she was a kid. \"I have proven my ability every step of the way,\" Hegar said, according to a news release from the ACLU. Two of the plaintiffs led Marine Corps \"female engagement teams\" in Afghanistan, according to the ACLU. They lived with and conducted missions with combat infantrymen. Another plaintiff was sent on similar missions in the Army, accompanying combat troops in Afghanistan, the ACLU said. Those jobs were considered temporary duties outside of the servicewomen's official specialties, so their combat experience is not given official recognition, the plaintiffs contend. The Service Women's Action Network, a national female veterans group, is also part of the suit, and the plaintiffs are being further represented by the ACLU of Northern California and a California-based law firm. Women make up more than 14% of 1.4 million active military personnel, the ACLU said. The military's policy excludes women from more than 238,000 positions, according to the ACLU, arguing that that situation prevents commanders from mobilizing their troops effectively. The ACLU and others who represent the woman said the policy denies training and recognition for service, puts women at a disadvantage for promotions or moving up in rank and prevents them from competing for jobs that they've shown they're capable of. Pentagon spokesman George Little took questions about the suit Tuesday, saying that he couldn't comment about pending litigation, but he added that Defense Secretary Leon Panetta \"remains very committed\" to examining role of women in the military.",

    "input": "(Financial Times) -- When Macau unveiled record gambling revenues on Tuesday, the government was silent about the source of much of the cash fuelling the territory's boom: illegal money transfers from mainland China. From pawn shops offering money withdrawal services, to underground banks using human mules to transport cash across the border, Macau tolerates the illicit methods that mainland punters use to bring money into the former Portuguese colony, which reverted to Chinese control in 1999. Mainland tourists, who have made Macau the world's largest gambling centre, can legally bring only Rmb20,000 ($3,175) when crossing into the Chinese territory. But many gamblers bring more cash to the casino tables by using their Unionpay debit card to withdraw money -- for a fee. \"There is no risk. We pretend to sell the customer an expensive watch or a piece of jewellery, charge the amount in renminbi to the debit card, and then give him the equivalent amount in Macau patacas or Hong Kong dollars as if the customer had decided to return the object for an immediate cash refund,\" says the manager of a pawnshop up the street from the Grand Lisboa casino, Macau's oldest casino owned by Stanley Ho, the gambling tycoon. The manager says the cardholder's records will register the transaction as a purchase. Unionpay, which was formed by China's big banks, says it bans such transactions, but the company declined to comment on the fact that the practice remained widespread. The company said it no longer released data on how much cardholders spent in Macau. People familiar with the industry say the Macau government cannot afford to shut down the illegal services, which hundreds of pawn shops advertise publicly on neon signs. \"The Macau government's hands are tied,\" says one veteran Macau policeman. \"It is not going to initiate a crackdown, because over 75 per cent of its revenue comes from gaming taxes.\" About 16m mainland Chinese visited Macau in 2011, an increase of more than 20 per cent on the previous year, and 60 per cent more than the 10m who visited in 2006. Analysts estimate that up to 30 per cent of Macau's gaming revenue could be channelled through illegal channels. \"Banking restrictions make it very difficult to transfer funds to Macau legitimately, but it is easy for people to find ways [around the rules],\" says a senior Chinese bank manager who gambles in Macau. While the debit card cashback service is the most visible source of money for the less well-heeled punters, those with deeper pockets have found different ways to avoid the restrictions. VIP punters -- whom analysts estimate generate 70 per cent of Macau's gaming revenues -- gamble on credit provided by so-called junket operators who seek out wealthy mainland gamblers. The junket operators receive commissions from the casinos or get a share of the profits. They, or their agents, sometimes use underground banks to return the money they have collected as debt on the mainland to Macau. The lenders use criminal gangs from Fujian and Guangdong provinces who in turn pay human mules as little as $5 -- compared with Guangdong's average daily wage of $7 -- to smuggle cash across the border. While the underground banks are part of what is known as the shadow banking system in China, providing credit to cash-strapped companies, their Macau-related business is limited to transferring money from other sources. One former junket operator and a Hong Kong owner of a mainland factory in Guangdong province, just across the border from Macau, described how operators also use Hong Kong business people who own companies on the mainland to transfer money illegally. He said operators handed over renminbi debts collected on the mainland to the factory owner, who used the money to pay his staff wages. Then, the owner sent the equivalent in Hong Kong dollars from his Hong Kong bank account to the operator's account in Macau. Both sides profited by agreeing a mutually beneficial exchange rate. There is no public data available to indicate exactly how much of Macau's gaming revenue comes from illegal channels, and casino operators and government officials refuse to speak about the issue. Macau's Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau refused to comment. \"Neither the Macau government nor Beijing wishes to damage the Macau economy. There's good reason to keep the scale of illegal transactions a closely guarded secret so nobody needs to take action,\" says the police officer. While Beijing does not condone gambling on the mainland, it has so far not cracked down on the illegal transfers. Analysts say it is unlikely to take action as the Chinese Communist party does not want to destabilise Macau just 13 years after the city returned to Chinese rule. \"Beijing is unlikely to take measures such as tightening visa restrictions or clamping down on debit card cashback services, as long as Macau is seen as a safe and enjoyable place to visit and casino operators refrain from activities or comments that might portray the city in a bad light,\" says Grant Govertsen, the Macau-based managing partner at Union Gaming Research, a US research group.

Iniesta had only just returned to Josep Guardiola's team last week as a substitute for the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal against Arsenal, and then also came on in the 2-0 win at Real Madrid, but has suffered another injury blow in training after tearing a calf muscle. The 25-year-old Spain international could be out for up to a month, Barcelona's Web site reported on Tuesday, meaning he may not be fit to return until the club's final domestic league match against Real Valladolid on May 16. \"Andres Iniesta suffered the injury during training and doctors have diagnosed a total rupture of the right femoral biceps muscle,\" the club's Web site said. Iniesta is set to miss the Champions League semifinals against Italian champions Inter Milan on April 20 and 28, but may return for the final on May 22 in Madrid if Barca progress that far. Barcelona lead Real by three points with seven matches to play ahead of Wednesday's home clash with Deportivo La Coruna, while their title rivals travel to Almeria on Thursday. Barca will again be without injured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but the Sweden international is expected to return to training before Saturday's local derby at Espanyol, the club's Web site reported. Meanwhile, Sevilla's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League suffered another blow with a 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Valladolid on Tuesday night. Sevilla stayed in fourth place on goal difference from Mallorca, who travel to struggling Zaragoza on Wednesday. Valladolid remained second from bottom despite giving former Spain coach Javier Clemente victory in his first home match. Clemente has earned four points from two games since taking over as Diego Costa headed the opening goal four minutes before halftime and fellow striker Manucho scored the second eight minutes after the break. Juan Cala pulled one back from long range with seven minutes left, but Sevilla fell to a ninth defeat from 16 away games this season. Getafe claimed seventh place from fellow Europa League Villarreal with a 3-0 victory in Tuesday's late match. On-loan striker Miku netted twice, scoring either side of a free-kick from Mane as all three goals came in the second half. Goalkeeper Diego Lopez gifted Miku the 56th-minute opener, and he pushed Mane's 25-yard strike onto the post and slowly over the line with 18 minutes left. Tenerife stayed in the third relegation place, one point above Valladolid, despite registering a first away win this season, 2-0 at mid-table Sporting Gijon.

    "input": "(CNET) -- If you want to consider a difficult computational problem, try thinking of the algorithms required to animate more than 10,000 helium balloons, each with its own string, but each also interdependent on the rest, which are collectively hoisting aloft a small house. The production team at Pixar faced many new technological challenges on \"Up,\" its tenth feature film. That was the challenge the production team at Pixar faced when it set out to begin work on \"Up,\" its tenth feature film, five years in the works, which hits theaters on Friday. There was absolutely no way the team was going to hand-animate the balloons. Not with their numbers in five-figures, and especially not when you consider that within the cluster, every interaction between two balloons has a ripple effect: If one bumped another, the second would move, likely bumping a third, and so on. And every bit of this would need to be seen on screen. In \"Up,\" the story revolves around the main character, 78-year-old Carl Fredricksen, who, frustrated with his mundane life, ties the thousands of balloons to his house and sets off for adventures in South America. A small boy ends up marooned on board, and hilarity ensues. The cluster of balloons is so central to the film's branding--it's called \"Up,\" after all--that to promote the film, Pixar teamed up with two of the world's cluster ballooning experts for a nationwide tour involving a real-life flying armchair and dozens of huge, colorful balloons. \"You have a movie that's about a house that flies, which is a pretty far-fetched idea,\" said Steve May, the supervising technical director on \"Up.\" \"We all know, from kids' parties, how a bunch of balloons behave, so if we could animate balloons in a realistic way, the believability that the house could fly would sell.\" For May, \"Up\" producer Jonas Rivera, director Pete Docter, and the many others involved in making the film, believability was key, even within the context of a story about a flying house. And while a major part of instilling that believability must come from a well-conceived and executed story and script, the animation is no less responsible for winning over potentially skeptical audiences. Balloons, the mother of animation invention May said that the animation department at Pixar never even considered hand-animating the balloons. But even standard computer animation wouldn't be up to the task, because of the N-squared complexity involved in the thousands of interdependent balloons. Instead, the studio's computer whizzes figured out a way to turn the problem over to a programmed physical simulator, which, employing Newtonian physics, was able to address the animation problem. \"These are relatively simple physical equations, so you program them into the computer and therefore kind of let the computer animate things for you, using those physics,\" said May. \"So in every frame of the animation, (the computer can) literally compute the forces acting on those balloons, (so) that they're buoyant, that their strings are attached, that wind is blowing through them. And based on those forces, we can compute how the balloon should move.\" This process is known as procedural animation, and is described by an algorithm or set of equations, and is in stark contrast to what is known as key frame animation, in which the animators explicitly define the movement of an object or objects in every frame. Procedural animation has been around for some time, but May suggested that even the most difficult uses of it in the past don't come close to what Pixar had to achieve in \"Up.\" Pixar fans may remember the scenes in \"Cars\" of a stadium full of 300,000 car \"fans\" cheering on a high-speed race below, each of which was independently animated. That, too, was done with procedural animation, May said, since creating so many cars individually would have been a non-starter. But even that complex computation problem didn't approach the balloon cluster issue in \"Up\": the \"Cars\" scene involved no interdependent physics. Getting the simulator humming properly is no easy task, as one might imagine. May said it involves setting rules for how individual objects should behave, giving the computer these initial conditions, and then \"let it run.\" Oddly, because the simulator does indeed run with those conditions and rules and the peculiarities of physics, the animators found themselves without precise control of what would happen with the balloons--or other objects in the film animated using these techniques. \"If the (balloon cluster) is moving too slow, we increase the amount of wind, and then run the simulator again,\" May said. \"Then maybe we turn the wind down. It's a little fun science experiment where sometimes, hopefully by the end, we're getting what we want.\" Losing control of balloons Sometimes, given the vagaries of physics and chaos theory, unexpected things happen. The computer team inputs the rules and because some of the initial conditions are random, \"you get semi-random results.\" One of May's favorite examples is that early in the film, when the house first is hoisted aloft by the balloons, a small group of the balloons actually broke off of the main cluster. May said that this breakaway group of balloons is actually visible--albeit very briefly--in \"Up.\" Eagle-eyed moviegoers can see the escaped balloons in the upper right-hand side of the screen, he said. \"We didn't mean for that to happen,\" he said, \"but (we said) 'It's cool, let's keep it.'\" Even being able to make such choices wasn't possible at the beginning of the film's production, however. May said Pixar's physical simulator, an open-source program called ODE, couldn't initially handle the complexity of modeling the behavior of more than 10,000 balloons. \"We could handle about 500 (balloons), and we knew we needed tens of thousands,\" he said. \"We knew we needed to develop a new simulator software pipeline...to handle an order of magnitude more complex simulation.\" Of course, at Pixar, adjusting to evolving computer needs on the fly is nothing new. In fact, May said the studio has done so in one form or another on many of its films. For example, he said that when the studio made \"Monsters, Inc.,\" it had to figure out how to animate the movie's monsters' fur. Similarly, when Pixar made \"Finding Nemo,\" the animators had to figure out how to simulate underwater scenes. \"We had to learn about (how light refracts under water), and murk and how particulates float under water,\" May said. And in \"Up,\" too, there were additional animation challenges. Among them were figuring out how to animate and render the feathers on Kevin, a bird that is a major character in the film, and how to make the cloth on (main character) Carl's clothes seem believable. Carl's threads were \"the hardest clothing we've ever had to animate here,\" said May, \"in part because Carl's a (small) man in an oversized suit. That was another case of (using) the physical simulation, and of setting up rules for how cloth should behave. And the looser the clothing, the more it can behave badly.\" Even Carl himself presented some animation difficulties, May said, because the character's head is shaped like a cube. Like many other elements in \"Up,\" the cube-shape of Carl's face wasn't a random whim of the director. Rather, it is a story element: May explained that Carl's character is based on someone who, as a young man, was vivacious and adventurous. But as he grew older, his small house became more and more surrounded by buildings, and \"it's like his world has compressed him into a square.\" Thus, a cube-like face. But May said animating his facial expressions, which must fit into this cube shape, was complicated. Smiles, for example, had to come up and wrap around his cheek. Still, for the award-winning filmmakers at Pixar, the goal is to make even the hardest animation problems look simple on the silver screen. As producer Jonas Rivera put it, \"The audience looks at (the balloon cluster) and says, 'Oh, that's pretty.' But they have no idea how much work went into it. We worked on that for over a year. (Then) the kid takes off his hat and runs his fingers through his hair. My mother will never know that took 15 people six weeks.\" Â© 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

    "input": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- British military investigators interviewed a woman who claimed to have met a man from another planet while she was walking her dog, newly released Ministry of Defence files have revealed. The woman said she had been approached by a man with a \"Scandinavian-type accent\" dressed in a flying suit-style outfit while out walking on a sports field near Norwich, eastern England, in 1989. She claimed to have been \"completely terrified\" during the 10-minute encounter. Running home, she said she had then seen a large glowing object rising vertically from behind some nearby trees. The woman called a local military base to report the encounter the following day. A cover note on the file of the incident describes it as \"one of our more unusual UFO reports.\" The incident is just one of around 1,200 sightings recorded by investigators between 1987 and 1993, according to the files released by the National Archives on Sunday. On another occasion, military officials took the unusual step of briefing ministers about an unidentified flying object photographed in the sky over Scotland alongside an RAF fighter jet. Witnesses claimed to have seen the large diamond-shaped object hanging in the air for about 10 minutes before it ascended vertically at high speed. Fearing intense media interest, investigators also commissioned detailed drawings of the object. The files also reveal that the Ministry of Defence abandoned plans to build a computer database of sightings out of fears of a public relations disaster should details of its existence ever be revealed. \"I personally doubt that the the MoD would lose much if we filed UFO reports in 'WPD' (the waste paper basket),\" one unnamed official wrote of the project.",

A bomb Tuesday injured relatives of Mohammed Dahlan, the Palestinian Authority's national security adviser. Fatah leader Mohammed Dahlan, the uncle of the groom, did not attend the wedding, according to witnesses. The cause of the explosion, which occurred at 11:10 p.m.  in Khan Younis, was not known. Dahlan is the Palestinian Authority's national security adviser. Details of Tuesday's explosion were not immediately clear. Dahlan's associates in recent years have been targeted by Hamas as tensions between the militant group and rival Fatah -- the Palestine Liberation Organization's largest faction -- escalated. In January 2007, Hamas gunmen tried to kill Dahlan's bodyguard. Dahlan was not present at the time of the attack. In that month alone, Fatah and Hamas militants abducted more than 50 members of their rival groups -- most of them in the West Bank town of Nablus -- according to Palestinian security sources. Dahlan's nephew was kidnapped the next month amid a fragile cease-fire between supporters of Hamas and Fatah. In late December 2006, Hamas accused Dahlan of orchestrating an assassination attempt on its leader Ismail Haniya. Haniya's son was injured in the attack. Dahlan has described himself to CNN in the past as being involved in directing Fatah's military response to Hamas' military \"provocation.\" Dahlan is particularly disliked by Hamas because during his leadership of the Preventive Security Forces in the 1990s, Hamas members were apprehended and tortured. After a series of suicide bombings in Israel in 1996, Dahlan took a major part in the Palestinian Authority's effort to crack down on Hamas.

    "input": "Editor's note: Steve Perry is the founder and principal of the Capital Preparatory Magnet School in Hartford, Connecticut, and author of \"Man Up!: Nobody is Coming to Save Us,\" which offers solutions to problems in the black community. Steve Perry says a question from a parent started his journey to creating a top-performing school. HARTFORD, Connecticut (CNN) -- \"Why do only rich kids get good schools?\" I was the founder and director of a part-time out-of-school college preparatory program. The questioner was a parent; herself a victim of a dulled urban education. The statement was more of an indictment than question, and I had no answer. \"Well, why can't this program be a school,\" she offered. The program sent 100 percent of our graduates to college. We served poor students who were the first generation in their families to attend college. We provided college preparation through a six-week summer program, after-school tutoring and in-school academic advising. That single mother's question came at the end of the summer program. This was always a tough time. As the kids said goodbye to their friends and the program's high expectations, we all looked at the school year with great trepidation. We knew that the students were returning to failed schools with very low expectations -- and results to match. Like that mom, I too wondered why wealth and whiteness are too often linked to quality education. Her question connected to a discussion that I'd been having with some colleagues during the summer program. All of the teachers in that program worked in failed urban schools. Many had tried to reform traditional urban schools. They'd started formal and informal programs, identified groups of kids and connected to parents. Each had had some success with some kids, but the conditions that led to the need to do something went unchanged. The question was raised at the end of our 2002 summer program. My first instinct was to begin down the path of opening an all-male minority charter school. In Connecticut, charter schools are publicly funded and privately run, with no teachers' unions, no school board influence and no centralized curriculum. These were the pluses. There was only one minus: There was no money. The charter idea was dead as soon as it began. I assembled an all -black team. My plan was to put black educators together, and we would show 'em. Brothers and sisters were gonna open a successful charter school. Black educators serving black kids. This was my first major mistake. Talent and commitment have no color. Kids don't care what color their teachers are, and I shouldn't have either. After almost a year of stops and starts with a team that was not effectively assembled, I realized that I failed in my judgment because I did not keep my eye on the goal, which was to build a school that sent kids to college regardless of their hue or economic status. I have never made that mistake again. I doubled back and went into the schools and found the teachers who stayed the latest and arrived the earliest. I looked for the most ambitious teachers who had a reputation of being the most talented, and we started a second team. I am a social worker. I knew that I could run an organization, but wasn't sure about developing curriculum. When I created Team 2, my first pick was the best teacher I could find. Rich Beganski is the perfect complement, or opposite, of who I am. He's meticulous and lives and breathes curriculum. He is an operations genius. He was a longtime assistant coach who never wanted to be coach. I've never been an assistant and don't want to be one. Our team was composed of a white guy, a Latina, a black woman and a black man bound by a single commitment: to send kids to college. In 2003-04, Connecticut was settling a desegregation case. A component of the agreement was to open eight magnet schools in Hartford in two years. Magnet schools are publicly funded and publicly run theme-based schools, complete with unions and subordinate to the local school board. The part-time college preparatory program was hosted in a community college. The college's president was an impulsive visionary. On a Friday afternoon elevator ride from the 10th to the seventh floor, he said, \"Steve, we're gonna start a high school, you should run it.\" I told him I would and got off on the seventh floor. First thing that following Monday, I was in his office with the dead charter school application. Over the next few months, we tweaked it until it became a magnet application. With the help of some of the program's parents, we submitted it to Hartford's mayor, superintendent, and then the board. The process was anything but smooth. The district could not conceptualize what Capital Prep would become. A year-round college-preparatory uniform school for grades six to 12 was the absolute antithesis of the district's offerings. Hartford was either the worst or second-worst school system in Connecticut, with a high dropout rate and three failed traditional high schools. At first, Capital Prep was a poorly received idea. It became real, in large part, because of the state's settlement and our team's determination to answer the question. After receiving school board and state approval in December 2004, we were expected to open for August 2005. The problem was that while we had a \"team,\" Capital Prep didn't have a single employee. Since we were becoming Hartford Board of Education employees, we all had to apply for our jobs. My hire was relatively painless. Beganski, the team's operations genius, was turned away as an \"internal\" candidate. After two years of working 30 hours a week to turn an idea into a reality, he became our first central office/union casualty. I promised to resign if he wasn't hired. Finally, the district relented and gave him the job that he had designed. This was to become an ongoing theme in the school's first few years: ridiculous actions focused on maintaining the failed status quo. We worked through the summer with the rest of the team. The district stumbled and stalled until, with less than two weeks before our first day of school, Capital Prep only had two staff members: Beganski and me. We were not allowed to hire a single teacher. Even though we had had a team that had worked for years researching and designing the school for no money, we were told that none of them could be hired because union rules dictated who and when we could hire. This meant that our last employee for year one was hired 14 hours before the first day of school. In the years that have followed, the struggles with the union and central office's narrow, regressive policies have tested our commitment to answer that mother's simple question. The complexity of the answer is rooted in Capital Prep's relationship to the failed policies of the once highly centralized district and educators' union. In recent years, a new superintendent has come on board -- the third in our first three years. His approach has been absolutely aligned with what we need to exist. He leaves us alone as long as we get results. He can't shield us from the unions, but he has supported our creativity and commitment to our kids. He lets me run the school, and our teachers teach what works. That's all we've ever sought. Answering the question of \"why only the rich kids get good schools\" has set our team on an odyssey. Seven years later, we have an answer that we are proud of. Rich kids are not the only kids who have good schools, because Capital Prep's 80 percent black/Latino, 60 percent poor students attend one of America's top high schools, according to US News & World Report. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Perry.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Since Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer signed Senate Bill 1070 into law in late April, there has been a wide array of opinions about the controversial immigration law, which takes effect Thursday. Here's a look at some of those viewpoints: . Immigration reform: Start with small steps: John D. Skrentny, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at U.C. San Diego, says: \"Like the characters in 'Hot Tub Time Machine,' reformers are stuck in 1986.\"   Arizona should kill immigration bill: Every movement needs heroes. The fight against discrimination in Arizona just got nine, writes Stephen Lemons, a blogger and columnist with the Phoenix New Times. Arizona had to take charge on immigration: Republican Russ Jones is an Arizona state representative from the 24th District in Yuma, and he voted for SB 1070: \"Some people criticize this new bill, while at the same time saying that something must be done about illegal immigration. Then they will mention the ever-popular catchphrase about \"comprehensive immigration policy.\" This is fine and good, but so far no one on either the state or federal level has enacted any workable solutions to this problem. ... With a lack of progress, this state has felt compelled to move forward in crafting its own legislation to deal with problems at home.\" Undocumented workers need legal rights: Richard Trumka is president of the AFL-CIO and former president of the United Mine Workers of America.  He believes that the United States \"cannot afford to have millions of hard-working people without legal protections, shut off from economic gain. But the way we treat the immigrants among us is about more than economic strategy: It is about who we are as a nation.\" Law meant to provoke government action: Michael Hethmon is a public interest lawyer and general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, the legal affiliate of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. He helped draft SB 1070, the Support Our Law Enforcement and Safe Neighborhoods Act.  Hethmon argues that the controversial law \"was intended by its creators, myself among them, to provoke sustainable immigration reform.\" How Obama can lead on immigration: Ruben Navarrette Jr. is a nationally syndicated columnist, an NPR commentator and a regular contributor to CNN.com.  He argues that \"it doesn't make any political sense for President Obama to talk about the need to reform our immigration system.\" Did Obama break his promise to Latinos? In this piece, Navarrette says Obama stands to lose the support of Latino voters by failing to uphold his promise on comprehensive immigration reform in his first year. Can Obama close the divide on immigration? Tamar Jacoby is president of ImmigrationWorks USA, a national federation of small-business owners advocating immigration reform.  She addresses the differing opinions among Americans about immigration reform, and suggests ways Obama can address that paradox.",

Her mysterious murder in a posh Beverly Hills neighborhood not only stunned her friends, but it sent fear through the exclusive community. Chasen was master at creating Oscar buzz . Beverly Hills Police Chief David Snowden asked journalists Friday to keep \"erroneous information, theories or speculation\" out of their stories about the killing. The chief assured residents it was \"a rare, isolated incident and that the Beverly Hills community remains one of the safest in the nation.\" There is no prevailing theory on whether the attack was road rage or a planned hit, a police official said. No motive or suspects have been identified, he said.

Douglas, who suffers from throat cancer, did not speak at the funeral for his former publicist. Lili Fini Zanuck, a film producer and friend, told mourners that Chasen's death brought the Los Angeles entertainment industry to \"a standstill.\" Reporters were kept at the cemetery gate, but publicist Stephen Jaffe described the service to CNN as \"very moving\" and full of \"a whole lot of love and respect\" for Chasen.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Man-made climate change threatens to stress water resources, challenge crops and livestock, raise sea levels and adversely affect human health, according to a report released by the Obama administration on Tuesday. Farmers and workers in central California are suffering through the third year of a worsening drought. The nearly 200-page document on global climate change -- released by the White House science adviser and mandated by Congress -- does not include new research, but encompasses several recent studies on the effects of global warming over the last half century. Among the report's key findings are an \"unequivocal and primarily human-induced\" rise in the Earth's temperature of 2 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 50 years, and a projection of more rapidly changing temperatures over the next several decades. \"It's not just a problem for the future,\" said Jane Lubchenco, administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. \"We're beginning to see the impact on our daily lives.\" The continuing temperature rise is likely to spur a series of negative consequences for the Earth's energy supply, water, transportation, ecosystems and health, the study said. \"[The report] tells us why remedial action is needed sooner rather than later, as well as showing why that action must include both global emissions reductions to reduce the extent of climate change and local adaptation measures to reduce the damage from the changes that are no longer avoidable,\" said John P. Holdren, the White House science adviser. Among the study's specific predictions: Longer and more intense heat waves; increased heavy downpours likely to cause widespread complications such as flooding and waterborne diseases; reduced summer runoff, creating greater competition for water, especially in the West; rising ocean water temperatures that will threaten coral reefs; an increase in wildfires and insect infestations; and more frequent coastal flooding caused by rising seas. The report is the first in almost a decade to break down impacts of climate change on regions and economic sectors of the United States. For example, warming trends in coming decades are expected to reduce the lobster catch in the waters of the Northeast, increase the intensity of hurricanes in the Southeast and accelerate drought in the Southwest, it said. Authors of the comprehensive report said they hope it can serve as a valuable tool for policymakers and other Americans, such as farmers making crop decisions or local governments passing zoning restrictions in coastal areas. The report comes as Congress debates a White House-backed climate change bill that seeks to reduce the United State's greenhouse gas emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 through a so-called \"cap and trade\" program. The bill cleared a key House committee vote in May and could be considered by the entire chamber within the next two weeks, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said Tuesday. The bill's future remains unclear in the Senate, where leaders are holding off advancing their own version of the legislation until it clears the lower chamber.",

    "input": "LONDON, England (CNN) -- When David Whitney traveled to Pakistan to shoot his film about a man forced to flee Afghanistan after falling foul of the Taliban he didn't expect fiction to turn into reality. A still from \"Kandahar Break.\" Production of the film was halted after the crew were fired upon by suspected Taliban militia. But that's exactly what happened three weeks into shooting political thriller \"Kandahar Break\" in late 2008. Gunmen attacked the first-time director and his crew near the Afghan border. Four Pakistani crew members were shot and wounded in the incident and the entire crew was forced to flee the region. Pakistani authorities later told Whitney that the gunmen were affiliated with the Taliban and were in fact targeting the Western members of the team. \"I was very upset. It was terrifying to know that somebody was trying to attack us, trying to shoot us,\" Whitney told CNN. With the help of local security forces the team was immediately evacuated to Islamabad and put on a flight out of the country in 24 hours. Whitney had only managed to film three-quarters of the script and the film's future lay in the balance. \"When I heard that the crew members who had been shot were going to be fine I started to think like the businessman and the producer,\" says Whitney. \"I thought, 'How are we going to finish this film? We're not just going to give up.' And to a man everybody involved agreed to finish it.\" After six months spent organizing financial backing, the original cast and crew flew to Tunisia to complete the movie and has been attracting interest from distributors. Despite the danger caused by shooting so close to the actual conflict zone, Whitney says he would shoot in the region again if he had the chance. \"Every place you point a camera there's a great shot. You don't have to go very far to find fantastic authentic Afghan architecture and beautiful landscapes. \"All the people are in the same sort of authentic costumes, so you don't have the problem of trying to find authenticity -- it's all around you.\" Whitney hopes the authenticity will help \"Kandahar Break\" enjoy the same level of success as Kathryn Bigelow's \"The Hurt Locker\" -- the first film about the Iraq war to make a profit at the U.S. box office. Bigelow's thriller tells the story of an elite army EOD bomb squad who battle insurgents and each other, as they disarm a innumerable roadside bombs on the streets of Baghdad. Bigelow shot \"The Hurt Locker\"  in Jordan, as close as she could get to the actual conflict zone. She also made use of  local actors. The film is based on screenwriter Mark Boal's first-hand experiences gathered whilst embedded with a bomb unit in Iraq. \"Because it was based on real life, we wanted to keep it as realistic as possible and keep it accurate,\" Bigelow told CNN. \"I mean this is a conflict that's still on-going so we felt responsible to the troops still there and the situation on the ground.\" The cast faced grueling shooting conditions: Temperatures ranged between 115 and 120 degrees Fahrenheit (46 and 49 degrees Celsius). It was even hotter in the authentic bomb suit worn by Jeremy Brenner, who plays Staff Sergeant James. The suit weighed 60 pounds. \"You really can't explain the heat and the weight of the suit,\" Brenner told CNN. \"That certainly helped the realism of it all. There were a few moments I felt like ... I've been as close as I could've come to war without actually being in the military. \"The heat was real, the dust was real, the costumes and everything was so real that the tension [was already there],\" Anthony Mackie who plays Sergeant JT Sanborn told CNN. \"Kathryn would come to us before every scene and say, 'Remember at any moment you can die.' And we kept that in mind throughout all the scenes.\" While \"The Hurt Locker,\" has made over $11 million in the U.S., previous movies dealing with conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have struggled to make money. Observers have attributed this to \"war fatigue\" suffered by audiences due to an abundance of war-stories in the media. Bigelow and Whitney are confident that cinema audiences have a thirst for knowledge about volatile regions like Iraq and Afghanistan that goes beyond what is reported on the news. \"I think the conflict [in Iraq] has been somewhat abstract for the general public, certainly speaking for myself,\" Bigelow told CNN. \"The film provides kind of a window, a lens onto what this particular conflict might be like, and gives it some specificity.\" David Whitney hopes \"Kandahar Break\" can have a similar effect. \"Afghanistan is at the moment quite central to global security. I think it's good that people are looking at Afghanistan, questioning it, asking all sorts of questions. If my film can play any part in that, any small part, then I'm pleased.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The new president of Egypt, Mohamed Morsy, is a 9-11 truther who doubts that America is telling the whole story about the collapse of the World Trade Center. He believes that a Christian or a woman should not be Egypt's leader. The ascent of his Muslim Brotherhood has been widely compared to Ayatollah Khomeini's rise to power in Iran, including most recently by Republican nominees Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. Egyptians recently breached the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, immediately calling to mind the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. Watching Morsy take to the podium at the U.N. General Assembly Wednesday for his first major address on the world stage, Americans could be forgiven for worrying that another anti-Western firebrand had just assumed power in Egypt, the Arab world's most populous country and its political bellwether. With his scruffy beard and his frequent references to Islamic values, Morsy bore a superficial resemblance to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who had just wrapped up one of his tirades minutes earlier. But Morsy is no Ahmadinejad, as their two very different speeches made clear. Since Morsy took office in late June, he has emerged as a strong, politically savvy leader who has put the country's powerful military and security services in their place. Opinion: Politics by mob in China and Mideast . In his address Wednesday, Morsy vowed to work for a Palestinian state and defend Islam against \"obscenities\" such as the film \"Innocence of Muslims,\" the YouTube clip that kicked off the recent riots across the Muslim world. But he also affirmed that Egypt would abide by its international obligations, including the peace agreement with Israel, and urged an end to the slaughter in Syria. Hardly the stuff of a wide-eyed radical. Morsy might yet prove to be the anti-American Islamist ideologue that some of his rhetoric suggests, but one all-important factor suggests that he will have to rein in his worst impulses. Egypt's economy is heavily dependent on tourism and foreign investment, and Morsy knows that he will be judged primarily on how he delivers for a population still reeling from the economic fallout of the revolution. At Tuesday's appearance at the Clinton Global Initiative, Morsy didn't blather on about evil Zionists and banning bikinis. Instead, he asked for money. \"We need assistance -- investment, technology, international cooperation,\" Morsy told his host, former President Bill Clinton. That's not the kind of thing you say if you're looking to shut out the world, Iran-style. In his interview with The New York Times -- his first with any paper since becoming president -- Morsy signaled that relations with the new Egypt would be more complicated than the days when American leaders could simply call up Mubarak and make demands. Egypt is a budding democracy, and the United States will have to take its people's views into account. Morsy's argument -- that \"successive American administrations essentially purchased, with American taxpayer money, the dislike, if not the hatred, of the peoples of the region\" by supporting dictators and Israel -- was merely a statement of fact backed up by poll after poll, not an anti-Western bromide. Many chuckled at his reference to the \"naked restaurants\" he disliked during his time as a Ph.D. student in California. But most Egyptians share his views about establishments such as Hooters, and plenty of Americans do, too. Some analysts worry that the Muslim Brotherhood will seek to impose Islamic law on Egypt in yet another comparison to Iran. But the country's constitution has long included a mild provision requiring that laws conform in spirit to sharia, and in a follow-up question-and-answer session, the Times' interviewers noted that Morsy had been quick to clarify that he did not support giving clerics a veto over the law. Morsy even ably handled questions about President Barack Obama's well-publicized remark that Egypt is not an \"ally,\" responding to CBS' Charlie Rose: \"This is dependent on the definition of an 'ally.' The understanding of an ally as a part of a military alliance, this is not existing right now, but if you mean by 'ally' a partnership and special diplomatic relationship and cooperation, we are that ally.\" That sounds like a pretty clear-eyed description of reality to me. News: What to call Egypt's relationship with the U.S. Finally, the Egyptian military hasn't gone away, and it still gets the bulk of U.S. aid money -- more than $1 billion each year. Hundreds, if not thousands, of members of Egypt's officer corps have fond memories of their training in the United States. When I was briefly detained during last year's uprising, a young military police captain who had visited the Washington area waxed rhapsodic about the Tyson's Corner shopping mall and an all-you-can-eat crab feast he enjoyed at the Radisson. The ties between the two militaries have certainly been strained by the events of the past 18 months, but not altogether broken. Should Morsy begin to run roughshod over the constitution or take actions abroad that hurt U.S. interests, such as cozying up to Iran or aiding anti-Israeli groups such as Hamas, he will get pushback not only from his country's generals and the United States but also Egypt's allies in the Arab Gulf states, such as Saudi Arabia. Morsy knows well that if he crosses a red line with any of those partners, the economic growth he needs will be in jeopardy. What happens, though, if Morsy can't deliver improvement in Egyptians' daily lives? That's when we might see him turn to anti-American populism and religious rhetoric to mask his failures and to cover his right flank.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Sepp Blatter has told CNN that his main aim in his fourth and final term as FIFA president is to restore the battered credibility of world football's governing body. The 75-year-old was re-elected unopposed as head of the organization on June 1 after the only other candidate, Asian Federation chief Mohamed Bin Hammam, pulled out of the race before being provisionally suspended by FIFA over bribery allegations. The vote drew widespread criticism as Blatter received 186 votes from football's 208 member associations, with critics saying it should not have gone ahead until the investigation into Hammam and FIFA vice-president Jack Warner -- who was also subject to suspension -- had been completed. \"I have said 'zero tolerance' is one thing, but I have also said the social and cultural implementation of football is important -- but now it's to rebuild the image of FIFA, that's number one, and I have already started,\" Blatter told CNN in his first sit-down interview since the election. Never mind Saint Sepp, the system is to blame . \"We are now somewhere where football needs a little bit more credibility because we came building up football, bringing so much money in to this game. \"Automatically a lot of devils came in to the game and now we are in a situation where we have to go forward and we have to cut all these allegations, criticism, whatever. We can't do it in one day, but we will do it.\" Blatter -- who described his election win as \"the title without glory\" and called the ruling body \"my FIFA\" -- ruled out blanket life bans for any FIFA member found guilty of corruption. \"It's not a killing instinct that we have to kill people! Zero tolerance means that if you commit something outside the play of field, you will have a punishment,\" the Swiss administrator said. \"But it can be a yellow card, it can be a red card, it can be a suspension for two games, three games ... lifetime.\" Maradona attacks 'corrupt' FIFA chiefs . Despite recent turmoil and opposition to Blatter in the race for the presidency, the Swiss insisted that both Hammam and Warner were longtime friends who remain on good terms. \"We are friends, but friends going together when it is in the interest of some of the people. For me, going together with people it's only for the interest of FIFA because I have represented FIFA for 36 years -- it's my FIFA,\" Blatter said. Warner has since backed down, for legal reasons, on threats to release \"a football tsunami\" by making public his email correspondence with Blatter. \"This is a question of character. If you have a problem inside your family you are not going to disclose if there is anything to be disclosed to the public,\" Blatter said. \"But I don't know what he means by the tsunami! It's easy to say, it's like allegations made by (England's former 2018 bid leader) Lord Triesman -- these are allegations and there is no evidence, so if somebody says it's a tsunami, you know there are also very little tsunamis.\" Blatter commits to 'change' after winning FIFA's presidential vote . Blatter said he would not open an investigation into the awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar -- Hammam's native country, which has been accused of bribing delegates ahead of last December's controversial vote -- unless his proposed new \"solutions committee\" or FIFA's existing ethics panel recommended such a probe. FIFA's own secretary general Jerome Valcke wrote an email suggesting that Qatar's financial clout had been behind its success. \"Let me work now on this new approach of the ethics committee, let me work with this committee of solutions. And if this committee of solutions or the ethics committee have the impression that they should do something then let them take the decisions,\" Blatter said. Blatter has vowed to bring in a panel of experts to form the solutions committee and help address FIFA's problems, including 88-year-old former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Dutch football legend Johan Cruyff, 64, and 70-year-old opera great Placido Domingo. \"These gentlemen are more or less advisers. They are not the experts but advisers, and what they should be also is the kind of council of wisdom -- which my Executive Committee would not like because they think they are the council of wisdom,\" Blatter said. \"Placido Domingo will be part -- he is happy, he is proud that he is part -- as Kissinger also! People say he (Kissinger) is an old man, but he is a wise man.\" The solutions committee will be chaired by a FIFA official, with Blatter dismissing suggestions that it should be an entirely independent body. \"The football family has asked me to solve the solution inside FIFA and not outside FIFA,\" he said. \"And if we have to go and open our borders and say everyone can come in ... we are a very organized institution with 208 associations, six continents. I've put already zero tolerance in the agenda!\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Nigeria has until Monday to overturn the decision to ban the national soccer team from all competitions for two years, the sport's governing body FIFA said on Friday. Failure to do so will result in the Nigerian Football Federation being suspended from all FIFA-related actitives, FIFA's communications director Nicolas Maingot told a news conference. \"FIFA will today send a letter to the Nigerian football federation indicating that the government of Nigeria has until Monday 6 p.m. (1600 GMT) to cancel its decision to withdraw Nigeria's participation in all FIFA and CAF organized football competitions,\" Maingot told a news briefing on Friday. Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan suspended the \"Super Eagles\" from international competition on Wednesday after their first round exit at the World Cup in South Africa. The team finished bottom of Group B after failing to win a single game. Jonathan's government also announced the expulsion of the Nigerian Football Federation, with an interim board put in place. Nigeria's Sports Minister Ibrahim Isa Bio confirmed Jonathan's decision in an interview with CNN. \"The government has taken a decision we believe is in the interests of Nigeria that we should for now, withdraw from international competition because our football since 1996 seems not to be growing,\" he said. \"The president Goodluck Jonathan has endorsed this decision and the Nigerian people are excited about it.\" However, FIFA rules prevent governments from interfering in the running of national football federations. Should Nigeria fail to resolve the situation, the country will be banned from competitive games including African competitions, and will also lose vital financial help from FIFA. \"A suspension goes beyond the suspension of the national team, it also involves the freezing of the financial help and no referees can participate in international competition,\" said Maingot. FIFA President Sepp Blatter had earlier warned France that they would face a possible suspension following a similar issue involving an investigation by French President Nicolas Sarkozy into the national team's infamous World Cup exit. Jerome Valcke, FIFA's general secretary, said Jonathan's decision puts soccer's world governing body into jeopardy. \"You can't allow a government to say all national teams can't play anymore in any international tournaments,\" Valcke told South African radio station 702. \"Why should we be so strong on France when they did what they did and we say nothing about Nigeria. \"We have 208 members ... if you have one country going against our statute, going against the football system, the pyramid of football ... all is destroyed.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- The European Union is dialing up the pressure on Iran, saying Monday it will cut off oil imports and freeze assets in an effort to starve the country's nuclear program of funding. \"Today's action demonstrates the EU's growing concern about Iran's nuclear programme, and our determination to increase peaceful, legitimate pressure on Iran to return to negotiations,\" British Foreign Secretary William Hague said in a statement from Brussels, Belgium. The sanctions freeze the assets of Iran's central bank in European Union nations and ban the importation of Iranian oil to those countries. The measures also block European Union countries from exporting petrochemical equipment and technology to Iran, or trading diamonds and precious metals with the Middle Eastern state. The sanctions are necessary because Iran continues to defy United Nations resolutions regarding its nuclear program, Hague said. \"Iran has it in its power to end sanctions by changing course and addressing the concerns of the international community,\" he said. Saudi prince: Why Iran won't close Strait of Hormuz . U.S. officials welcomed the sanctions, with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton saying in a joint statement Monday that the new measures will \"sharpen the choice for Iran's leaders.\" But Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Aragchi, said the measures will only harm the fragile economies of the European Union, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency. \"Sanctions have proved ineffective in the past and will prove futile in the future, too,\" IRNA quoted Aragchi as saying. The U.S. government took its own punitive action regarding Iran on Monday, with the Treasury Department targeting the nation's third-largest bank, the state-owned Bank Tejarat, for allegedly working with other Iranian banks and firms subject to sanctions tied to Iran's nuclear program. Read a summary of sanctions against Iran . This step means \"all of Iran's largest state-owned banks have been sanctioned by the U.S. based on their involvement in Iran's illicit activities,\" according to a statement from the U.S. government department. David S. Cohen, the U.S. Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, called Bank Tejarat -- which has nearly 2,000 branches in Iran, plus branches in France and Takijistan -- \"one of Iran's few remaining access points to the international financial system. \"Today's sanction against Bank Tejarat will deepen Iran's financial isolation, make its access to hard currency even more tenuous, and further impair Iran's ability to finance its illicit nuclear program,\" said Cohen. The International Atomic Energy Agency said shortly after the fresh oil sanctions were announced that officials from the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency will visit Iran January 29 to 31 \"to resolve all outstanding substantive issues.\" How sanctions hit ordinary Iranians . Inspectors are in and out of the country regularly, an agency spokeswoman said Monday, but a high-level visit of the kind taking place at the end of the month is more unusual. Top officials in Israel, which fears it would be a target of an Iranian nuclear weapon, welcomed the sanctions. \"This is a step in the right direction. ... Heavy and swift pressure on Iran is needed,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, even as he warned that it is impossible to know what would come of the measures. \"For now, Iran continues to produce nuclear weapons without disturbance,\" he said. Defense Minister Ehud Barak called the EU move \"highly important,\" saying it set \"a new standard for the sanctions like never before.\" Iran exports 2.2. million barrels of oil a day, with about 18% bound for European markets, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The world consumes about 89 million barrels of oil per day. The European Union will allow contracts that are already in place to be fulfilled until July 1, it said. Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told CNN last week that his country could make up the difference if Iran was banned from exporting oil. Al-Naimi said the country has a spare capacity \"to respond to emergencies worldwide, to respond to our customer demand, and that is really the focus. Our focus is not on who drops out from production, but who wants more.\" Tehran has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz, the only outlet to and from the Persian Gulf, as it faces possible sanctions. The United States has made clear it will not let that happen. Iran: Stuck between U.S. and a hard place . Seventeen million barrels of oil per day passed through the critical shipping lane in 2011, according to the Energy Information Administration. The Iranian government gets about half its revenue from oil exports, according to the agency. Analysts have said that while the new sanctions are the toughest ever imposed, they still contain many loopholes. Iran is expected to still be able to sell its oil to places like China, India or other Asian countries, but perhaps at a discount of 10% to 15%. About 35% of Iran's oil exports currently go to China and India. Western leaders have been walking a fine line with Iran, working to come up with a plan that squeezes the country's finances yet doesn't result in a loss of Iranian oil exports, which could send crude and gasoline prices skyrocketing. The United States and United Kingdom have already put new measures in place against Iran, and Washington has been pressing allies, including Japan and South Korea, to stop buying Iranian oil. U.S. carrier defies Hormuz threat . On Friday, EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton challenged Iran to respond to an offer she made in a letter last October. Ashton wrote that world powers are open to negotiations if Iran is serious about addressing its nuclear program without preconditions. Her office released the letter on Friday. Ashton's spokesperson pointedly noted, \"We are waiting for the Iranian reaction.\" Ashton wrote that the West wants to \"engage in a confidence-building exercise\" that would lead to a \"constructive dialogue\" and a \"step by step approach\" in which Iran would assure the international community that its nuclear program is peaceful. Clinton told reporters in Washington that \"we stand by that letter.\" \"They have to give up their nuclear weapons program ... and they have to be willing to come to the table with a plan to do that,\" she said. Clinton made the comments Friday after a meeting at the State Department with German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle. The German minister was blunt in his assessment of Iran's actions: \"Tehran keeps violating its international obligations on the transparency of its nuclear program. We have no choice but to pass tough new sanctions that address the financial sources of the nuclear program.\" Iran says its nuclear program is not military, but the United States and many of its allies suspect Iran intends to produce a bomb. The International Atomic Energy Agency has expressed similar concerns. \"One thing is clear,\" Westerwelle added. \"The door for serious dialogue remains open, but the option of nuclear weapons in Iran is not acceptable to both of us.\" CNN international affairs correspondent Jill Dougherty, CNNMoney's Steve Hargreaves, and CNN's Claudia Rebaza, David Wilkinson and Guy Azriel contributed to this report.",

    "input": "Delaram, Afghanistan (CNN) -- U.S. Marines stand under the blazing sun at Camp Bastion airfield waiting for their ride to take them far beyond the perimeter fence. Wearing body armor and weapons, they dump their helmets and bags in the dirt and look out onto one of Afghanistan's busiest runways. A $25 million Harrier jet flies past, leaving the roar of its engine in its wake, while a C-130 Hercules touches down to pick up troops and cargo. An Osprey aircraft -- half helicopter, half plane -- hovers in the distance before landing to join the dozen other Ospreys sitting on the tarmac. Read more: U.S. surge over as last of extra troops exit . A Sikorsky then comes into view. The helicopter invented by a Russian-American is older than the other military hardware on the runway but it's reliable and gets the job done. As it approaches the apron of the runway, the draft blows the dirt straight into the faces of the Marines. They don't turn their backs to the assault of sand, dirt and gravel but hold their ground and stare right into it -- a display of Marine toughness that could come in handy in the mission ahead. They're headed to Nimroz province, where the insurgency is growing stronger by the day. Opinion: Green-on-blue attacks show there's no easy way out . As I stand there wondering if all these Marines will return from their tour in the badlands of southwest Afghanistan, a lanky 19-year-old soldier with a buzz cut strolls by and strikes up a conversation. He tells me he was in the third grade in Minnesota when the September 11 attacks occurred. \"I grew up watching the war in Afghanistan on CNN, and I knew I wanted to come here and fight for my country,\" he says. We've come to the front line of this war to see the transfer of power that is under way between U.S. and Afghan forces. But a spate of so-called \"green on blue\" attacks -- Afghan soldiers or police attacking U.S. and other international forces -- has caused serious alarm for U.S. and ISAF troops, and the transition process has been fast tracked. Read more: U.S. restricts Afghan ops after 'green-on-blue' killings . The Marines have sent us to Delaram, at the crossroads of Helmand, Nirmroz and Farah provinces, to show how joint patrols are still happening, despite NATO's orders to suspend many of the operations. As we touch down in this dusty, desolate landscape, it quickly becomes apparent the Marines are no longer training the Afghans. They've handed over the reins of this outpost to the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the 28 Marines who remain here are working in an \"advisory\" role, marking off the days on the calendar until they are scheduled to go home for Christmas. While everyone lives inside the massive compound, the two camps are divided by high barbed-wire fences, with several hundred meters of land between them. The Marines and Afghans live, eat and sleep separately. They only come together and mix on common ground where the central command headquarters is located. A Marine introduces me to the man in charge -- Gen. Abdul Wasea Milad from the ANA. The former Mujahadeen fighter is leading 5,000 Afghan soldiers from the Iranian border east to Kajaki -- some of the most dangerous territory in the country. He's just returned from a 10-day trip visiting many of his outposts, driving hundreds of kilometers along Highway One. It's a journey the Americans wouldn't even consider doing by road because of all the improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, planted daily by insurgents. When I ask the general about the dangers he faces, he just laughs and tells me: \"This is Afghanistan. My men sweep the roads for landmines every morning, so they're fine to travel on during the day. It's when we sleep that the Taliban puts them out again.\" While standing in Wasea's office, a soldier informs him of a report of a suspected IED outside the local police headquarters. He takes us in his Humvee to the site about three kilometers (two miles) beyond the wire from Camp Delaram. The Americans are not accompanying us. They have no desire to leave the fortified compound, as they explain this is now an Afghan operation. Lt. Jan Mohammad, who has been with the ANA for the past two years, is leading the mission. He and another solider are carrying a metal detector, a block of C4 explosive, detonators and a drag rope. The site is off the main highway on a dirt road leading to a village. We walk in single file, aware of every single step, in case there are other mines that have been laid under the surface. The soldier sweeping the road suddenly stops when his equipment starts beeping -- a sign it's picked up something possibly very dangerous. We all crouch down and he gently picks at the earth. After a painstaking search he declares there's nothing there and we move on. Soldiers armed with M4 machine guns stand above us on the dusty hill watching in case there's an ambush. A local villager on a motorcycle attempts to drive in our direction. The soldiers point their weapons and yell out a warning, telling the driver to head off in another direction. Suicide bombings are also a common tactic for the Taliban, and these soldiers are only too aware of the dangers that now face them. We reach the site and Lt. Mohammad takes over. The 30-year-old officer earns less than $300 a month, risking his life every day to disable these deadly devices. I ask how much experience he has, and he tells me: \"It's not my first time. I have defused 70 IEDs in Kajaki in seven days when I was there with the Marines.\" When I ask him why he does this dangerous line of work he replies: \"If I lose my life it wouldn't be a problem. But if others die while I am doing this then I would feel bad because I don't want others to die. This is my job -- to save my people from the risk of these IEDs.\" As he lies on his stomach assessing the area, he digs with his hands to remove the earth. He slowly stands up and sweeps the metal detector over and over again, making sure he identifies the exact spot before lying back in the dirt to continue digging. After 20 minutes, he stands up and declares the site is clear explaining the Taliban must have removed the IED after it had been reported to the police, or a local came and took it to claim the $100 reward. As we walk back to the Humvee I ask Lt. Mohammad how he feels about the U.S.-led coalition pulling out of Afghanistan by 2014. He says: \"It wouldn't make a difference to me if they leave because it is my country and I will keep doing my job.\"",

    "input": "(CNN) -- Former top Pakistani military officers Sunday called for Pakistan's former strongman to be allowed back without facing arrest and condemned what they called the \"bashing\" of the country's armed forces. More than 100 former officers, most of them generals and admirals, signed their names to a letter calling for Pervez Musharraf to be allowed to return to Pakistan \"and contest elections according to democratic norms.\" The retired brass included the retired Gen. Muhammad Aziz Khan, once the head of Pakistan's joint chiefs of staff during part of Musharraf's rule, and Adm. Shahid Karimullah, who served as head of the navy under Musharraf. \"We feel that Gen. (R) Pervez Musharraf should be provided with a level playing field in the political arena and also provided protocol and security as befits any ex-president of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan,\" wrote the officers, who have formed a group they called \"Pakistan First.\" Musharraf, who seized power in a 1999 coup, has been living in London and Dubai since resigning in 2008. He had announced plans to return from exile in late January and run in upcoming elections -- but his party said he was reassessing those plans when Pakistan's elected government warned that if he returned, he faced arrest in connection with the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. A U.N. report in 2010 accused Musharraf's government of failing to protect Bhutto, who had returned to Pakistan from her own exile to run for office. Musharraf has denied the allegations, arguing that Bhutto had police protection and took unnecessary risks, but a Pakistani court issued a warrant for his arrest. Bhutto's widower, Asif Ali Zardari, is now Pakistan's president. If Musharraf were to return, he would be walking into the middle of a public squabble between Pakistan's civilian and uniformed leadership that was sparked by a memo that allegedly asked for U.S. help to rein in the military. In Sunday's letter, the ex-generals said they opposed the \"bashing\" of Pakistan's army and its powerful Inter-Services Intelligence agency. \"We feel that erosion of these institutions can only lead to weakening of Pakistan's position as a sovereign and proud nation,\" they wrote. \"This forum feels that while all state institutions must be allowed to function within the purview of their respective roles, the demands of national dignity and state security dictate that all organs of the state as well as the media persistently raise and maintain the prestige and morale of the nation and its armed forces, both at home and abroad.\" Zardari faces his own legal problems. His prime minister, Yousuf Raza Gilani, appeared before Pakistan's supreme court Thursday in a battle over corruption cases facing the president and other officials, telling reporters the president has \"full immunity\" from prosecution under an amnesty granted by Musharraf before Zardari and Bhutto returned in 2007. In 2009, the justices ruled that amnesty was unconstitutional and called on the government to reopen the cases. The government has not done so, and the court has cited Gilani for contempt.",

    "input": "(CNN) -- When our helicopter flew into Port-au-Prince, it almost felt like we were on some silent glide. The sharp sound of the rotor blades faded into background noise. Sound did not rise from the ground. There was not enough traffic or people or life to raise a ruckus. There were no fires burning or that dark energy that rises up from the ground when there is danger in the air. There was silence, people huddling in tents alongside flattened buildings, people sifting slowly through the rubble of their lives, people adrift. We entered Haiti like a lot of the folks entering Haiti, down right nervous. Haiti has a history of horrible acts of violence against its own people and visitors. Journalists have died in Haiti. There are many guns and many vendettas. It's not just that there is an earthquake whose aftershocks could rattle away at what remains. There is an expectation of danger, a question in the air. Will these desperate, disheartened, wounded people rise to violence and theft in the wake of this latest, largest disaster? We landed without incident in the yard of the Dominican Embassy with precious supplies brought in by relief organizations. A CNN convoy laden with water and money and fuel followed us in by land without a hitch. And in the days that followed, we did not see a population breaking into buildings or fighting over scant resources. The Haiti we saw is not a land of fires and violence and looting. This is a land where desperation has been supplanted by despair. Each day, we left our workspace with security people, drivers, big guys that were supposed to help us navigate presumed dangers. They mostly hung out and chatted with kids playing around our cars. They walked us into a huge plaza where a massive tent city had formed. It was so quiet. People just sitting there, holding their children beneath sheets so they aren't burned in the sun. Some mothers are bathing their kids in murky water. There is one remedial medical station beneath a tent. Three medical volunteers with meager supplies tend to the wounds of dozens. Anguished mothers wait patiently with children wounded and wailing. No one complains. No one pushes. One afternoon we happened upon Capital Bank, a building that also housed a Western Union and some local money order services. A flotilla of United Nations folks from Ghana and France and Canada descended with major artillery. A tank, a string of armored cars and high-ranking officials with bright stripes decorating their uniforms rushed around on high alert. They shut down the street as they entered the building and brought out sacks that seemed to be filled with money. Full coverage . When we went to take a picture, they became very agitated. Some of them yelled that we had no business here and pushed us back into the road where the oncoming cars fortunately stopped in time. They were so overwhelming that a female official from Ghana began to laugh at her colleagues. \"Let them take the photo,\" she told a muscular Canadian officer. \"Here,\" he said handing her his walkie talkie. \"You be in charge of this mission.\" But the \"mission\" was barely picture worthy. The Haitians ambled by, as the apparent sacks of money were removed for safe keeping. The scene was the same at the building where taxes are collected. A great crane lifted rubble while a crowd watched peacefully. No one seemed to be trying to get into the flattened presidential palace nearby even though there was not much visible security. We also passed gas lines. Gas is the key to so many things right now, powering the car that can get you out of this disaster, running the generator that can turn on your lights or make it possible to call for help on a cell phone. The cars sit quietly, drivers holding their places without a quarrel. We drove around day after day and saw nothing but sad people sweeping their streets of rubble and bodies and wreckage. We drove out to Leogan, the epicenter of the quake, and people calmly moved bananas, sugar cane and water from the fields into tent cities erected in open space. Haiti's missing, found . We saw an organized crowd being handed water bottles from soldiers who flew in from Camp Lejeune. We did not see one gun, except the ones carried by security guards, police officers and soldiers. In Jacmel, two hours south, a group of young Haitians ran around with expensive video cameras documenting the destruction of their hometown, Haiti's cultural capital. They had water flown in by their sponsors as well as food and generators, but no one tried to steal them. The hotels that survived were unguarded but not a soul ventured in to take the furniture or bedding that might have made life in the tent cities more bearable. Haitian doctors staffed the \"hospital,\" a patch of grass outside the real hospital that fell down. Cuban doctors helped them with their work, rationing antibiotics and painkillers. People were in great pain, but no one screamed for help or painkillers. They seemed to think that they were getting whatever was available. The Canadians posted guards at one gate to keep folks from getting to the piers where they brought in supplies, but no one was trying to get in anywhere around this huge dock. They stood in line at distribution centers, grabbed a broom or shovel to help the soldiers clear streets. When the French erected a mobile medical unit, the people formed a peaceful line and repeatedly expressed their gratitude. These are people with injuries that make you gasp. Many amputations have been done by amateurs in bad circumstances. It's hot. No one said a word. We followed the directors of an orphanage as they traveled through some of Port-au-Prince's poorest neighborhoods. They didn't have many supplies, but they wanted to share. No one tried to rob us. A woman broke down in tears begging us to help us find her son. She ignored our bottles of water and food. She just wanted her son. Impact Your World . A few nights later, her orphanage was hit by bandits who didn't take anything, but scared the kids. At another orphanage we visited, bandits struck twice but left both times with nothing. The orphanage director said they left it because they didn't want to steal supplies from children. My colleagues saw a few folks break into places and even captured a few scuffles on tape. But those who have spent a lot of time in Haiti was certain there was no more crime, possibly even less crime, than would visit this city of millions on a regular day. The story of Haiti, at this time, is not one of unending violence, looting and a population angry enough to fight over scant resources. But the people we met were wounded and weary and afraid to go back inside. The earth could shake at any moment and death could visit once again.",

After making landfall on Baja California, Hurricane Jimena started weakening Wednesday night. The storm made landfall Wednesday afternoon between Puerto San Andresito and San Juanico, Mexico, the National Hurricane Center said. As of 8 p.m. ET, the center of Jimena was located near San Buenaventura, Mexico, and about 40 miles (64 kilometers) south of Santa Rosalia, Mexico. It was moving north at near 12 mph (19 kph), and was expected to turn northwest and slow Wednesday night before turning west on Thursday. \"On the forecast track, the center of Jimena will move over the central Baja California peninsula tonight and Thursday, then move into the Pacific west of Baja California late Thursday or Thursday night,\" the Hurricane Center said.  See the storm's projected path Â» . The storm's maximum sustained winds had decreased slightly, to 80 mph (129 kph) with higher gusts, the hurricane center said. Jimena is expected to weaken into a tropical storm Wednesday night, forecasters said. At its peak Tuesday, Jimena was a Category 4 storm, with winds of 145 mph (233 kph). A hurricane warning remained in effect for parts of the Baja peninsula, from Bahia Magdalena north to Punta Abreojos on the west coast, and from San Evaristo north to Mulege on the east coast, the Hurricane Center said. A hurricane warning means hurricane conditions, including winds of at least 74 mph (119 kph), are expected within 24 hours. A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were in effect for the Baja California peninsula north of Punta Abreojos to Punta Eugenia on the west coast, and north of Mulege to Bahia San Juan Bautista on the east coast. A tropical storm warning was in effect for the peninsula north of Punta Eugenia to San Jose de las Palomas on the west coast, and north of Bahia San Juan Bautista to Bahia de los Angeles on the east coast. A tropical storm warning also was issued for northwestern mainland Mexico, from Huatabampito to Bahia Kino, the Hurricane Center said.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Marcel Siem held his nerve amid a late charge from Francesco Molinari to take the Open de France -- his first European Tour title for eight years. The German finished on eight-under-par, one shot better than Molinari who recorded a final-round 64 on Sunday, the lowest score of the week at Le Golf National in Paris. The Italian was six shots off the pace prior to Sunday's finale and double bogeyed the first hole but went on to make nine birdies. But Siem held held firm, despite a dropped shot on the 18th, to take his second title on the European Tour, and his first since the 2004 Dunhill Championship. \"I'm so happy. This means a lot to me,\" Siem told the European Tour's official website after picking up a check for $640,000. \"First, after eight years it doesn't matter what kind of tournament you won; it's huge, because you've got the confidence again. \"Every time I've played consistent golf this year, and there were so many times up there, I couldn't make it. Stupid things happened the whole time. \"It means so much to me to win after that long stretch. It's all about winning in the end and it puts so much pressure every time you don't win and people start talking, you will never win again and stuff like that, so it's very important for me. \"I love this golf course. I always loved it and I love it even more or even better now. I'm super happy.\" Molinari hit just 29 shots on his closing nine holes and despite missing out on the title, he was delighted with his form. \"It's been just an unbelievable day really,\" he said. \"I had a really bad start, but two years ago when I finished second here, I doubled the first on the last day. \"From then on, it was just great golf. I had a couple of good breaks and finally a lot of putts going in the hole. \"I was in the moment, in the zone and I wasn't really counting the birdies. The game has been feeling well all week and everything was coming out perfect.\" World No. 3 Lee Westwood shot a closing round of 70 to finish 40th a day after an injury scare nearly forced him out of the tournament. \"The leg is fine - it wasn't a problem today,\" he said, after fears he may have to miss the year's third major, the British Open at Royal Lytham and St. Annes starting on Thursday week. Meanwhile, the U.S. PGA Tour saw a sixth first-time winner this season when rookie Ted Potter Jr. claimed the Greenbrier Classic title after a playoff on Sunday. The 28-year-old beat fellow American Troy Kelly with a four-foot birdie putt at the third extra hole to earn a place at the British Open, the FedEx Cup playoffs and next year's Masters. He also earned a two-year tour exemption plus the financial security of a $1,098,000 windfall as first prize, having shot a second successive six-under 64 to join Kelly on -16 at the end of 72 holes. \"It was just a big relief,\" said the left-hander, who had missed five successive haflway cuts before the West Virginia tournament. \"All the struggles the last few weeks, knowing that now I've got a couple years to try to improve on my game and win some more tournaments.\" U.S. Open champion Webb Simpson had led after three rounds, and held a one-shot advantage going into the final nine holes as he did at the Old White TPC course last year, but he faded to a tie for seventh on -11 after three successive bogeys derailed his challenge.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- The Obama administration is proposing rules to govern the sale and transfer of ammonium nitrate, a potentially explosive substance that was used in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and reportedly was a component in the July bomb attack on a government building in Oslo, Norway. The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday announced proposed rules for an Ammonium Nitrate Security Program that would affect anyone who buys at least 25 pounds of the material. Those who want to buy or sell ammonium nitrate would be required to register with the federal government and their names would be run against the FBI's Terrorist Screening Database of known or suspected terrorists. \"In today's ever-evolving threat environment, we must continually reinforce the security of substances, such as ammonium nitrate, which can be used for legitimate purposes or exploited by terrorists,\" Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in a statement on the proposal. Napolitano said the government wants to secure potentially dangerous amounts of the chemical while not hampering legitimate use. Ammonium nitrate is commonly used in farm and landscaping fertilizers as well as in already-regulated commercial explosives for construction and mining. Under the new program, those who sell the chemical would be required to keep their records and report any instances of theft or loss within 24 hours of discovery. The 200-page proposal for the Ammonium Nitrate Security Program has been posted on the Federal Register and the public now has 120 days to comment. The Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program already regulates facilities that possess more than 2,000 pounds of fertilizer-grade ammonium nitrate or 400 pounds of the explosives grade of the material, according a Department of Homeland Security official. In addition, in recent years, sellers and the government have participated in voluntary programs to protect ammonium nitrate. In 1995, Timothy McVeigh rented a Ryder truck and filled it with ammonium nitrate and fuel oil to construct a vehicle bomb he then used to blow up the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building in Oklahoma City. The blast killed 168 people.",

    "input": "Paris (CNN) -- A French cyclist taking part in the prestigious Tour de France race has been arrested, a national police official said Tuesday, leading his team to suspend him while claims of doping are investigated. Cofidis, a professional cycling team, said its cyclist Remy di Gregorio \"had allegedly attempted to resort to the use of doping substances to improve his performance\" and therefore it was suspending him as a precaution. Di Gregorio, 26, is being questioned in police custody but has not been charged, according to the national police official who has been briefed in detail on the matter. Police raided the hotel where some members of the Cofidis team were staying in Bourg-en-Bresse, in eastern France, Tuesday morning, he said. Two other people were detained in Di Gregorio's hometown of Marseille in connection with the ongoing investigation, the police official said. Judge tosses out Armstrong suit against anti-doping agency . The office of the Marseille prosecutor, Jacques Dallest, said in a statement that an investigation into the use of illegal substances had been opened against \"a professional cyclist\" as well as person \"practicing naturopathy.\" One of the people involved was carrying, in a vehicle, products of which the exact nature is still being determined, the statement said. If proven, the crime carries a maximum penalty of seven years of imprisonment and a fine of Ã¢âÂ¬150,000 ($184,000). Cofidis manager Yvon Sanquer told CNN: \"In France, there is the presumption of innocence, so until proven guilty, we cannot say he (Di Gregorio) is guilty.\" Cofidis said in a written statement that it had \"very little information\" at present, but that the suspicions weighing against Di Gregorio \"lead us to apply the current sanctions in a strict and immediate manner in our team, concerning the violation of ethical rules.\" \"Remy di Gregorio is therefore suspended, from now, as a precaution, as we wait for more ample information concerning the reality of the crimes of which he is accused. If these crimes are established, he will be dismissed immediately as per the terms of his contract and the ethical policy of the team.\" Cofidis said what it called an \"isolated case\" should not affect the rest of the team and that its other riders would be ready to start the next stage Wednesday as planned. The team has had a long-standing commitment to fighting doping and will be reinforcing its prevention efforts, the statement said. \"Those who cheat do not have a place at Cofidis,\" it added. The investigating judge in the case is Annaick Le Goff, who is a judge for the health division, the national police official said. Tuesday's arrest was made in a joint operation with the division of public health of the Marseille Gendarmerie, he added. Di Gregorio is currently ranked 35 out of 178 competitors, according to the Tour de France website, trailing British cyclist Bradley Wiggins, who holds the lead by just over 18 minutes ahead of Wednesday's resumption of the competition. Tuesday was the first rest day for the riders taking part in the world's best-known cycling race, which began June 30. In the course of the race, which consists of a short time trial prologue followed by 20 longer stages, the cyclists will cover 3,497 kilometers (2,173 miles), including grueling mountain climbs, before they cross the finish line in Paris on July 22. Di Gregorio joined the Cofidis team this year, having previously competed with the Astana professional cycling team, which is backed by Kazakhstan. He came in 78th in the Tour de France in 2010 and 59th in 2008, and has won three stages in the eight years he's been competing in the race. Spanish cyclist Alberto Contador was part of the Astana team when he won the Tour de France in 2010. Later, after he failed a drug test, he was stripped of the title and banned from competing for two years by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The issue of alleged doping in professional cycling was thrust into the spotlight last month, when the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency accused U.S. cyclist Lance Armstrong of using performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong, who denies the allegations, faces a lifetime ban and could be stripped of his seven Tour de France victories if found guilty by the USADA. He won the Tour each year from 1999 to 2005. A lawsuit filed by Armstrong which sought to halt the USADA's legal case against him was thrown out by a federal judge Monday. CNN's Dheepthi Namasivayam reported from Paris and Laura Smith-Spark from London.",

    "input": "Washington (CNN) -- Bush administration lawyers who wrote \"torture\" memos have been cleared of allegations of professional misconduct after a Justice Department internal investigation, which recommends no legal consequences for their actions. The report by the Justice Department concludes the high-ranking lawyers who developed controversial legal guidance on waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques may have exercised poor judgment, but not professional misconduct. The conclusion resulted from a decision by top career Justice Department executive David Margolis to reverse a recommendation of investigators that found the two lawyers' legal memos did constitute professional misconduct. That tentative conclusion, which was overruled by Margolis, said the lawyers should be referred to their state bar associations for potential disbarment. But in the final report, the examination of the legal guidance written by Justice Department lawyers John Yoo and Jay Bybee found they did not constitute a professional breach that could have led to state disbarment. The report by the Justice Department ethics office, called the Office of Professional Responsibility, also examined and cleared attorney Steven Bradbury. He headed the Office of Legal Counsel, which provided legal guidance to the executive branch during President George W. Bush's second term. The often-delayed release of the report came late Friday after it was sent to lawmakers on the House and Senate Judiciary committees, who made the findings public. In addition to the content itself, the constantly delayed release of the politically sensitive report had become an issue. Issuance of the report was repeatedly postponed for more than a year, prompting lawmakers and civil liberties groups to press for publication of the investigation's findings. In November, Holder told Congress the report would be made public \"by the end of the month.\" Reaction to the Justice Department investigation largely fell along party lines, with liberal Democrats unhappy with the conclusions, and highlighting criticism of the Bush Administration lawyers. \"While the report concludes the lawyers did not breach their minimal professional obligations, I certainly hold top lawyers at the Justice Department] to a higher standard than that, as all Americans should,\" said Rep. John Conyers, D-Michigan. Conyers, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee focused on the lawyers' \"poor judgments,\" and said, \"Today's report makes plain that those memos were legally flawed and fundamentally unsound.\" Meanwhile, conservative lawmakers applauded the decision not to recommend action against the Bush administration officials who proposed enhanced interrogation techniques. \"It is important that future government lawyers know that their efforts to protect Americans will not be criminalized by future administrations,\" said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee. \"We know that the decision of these attorneys to approve enhanced interrogation tactics in the wake of 9/11 saved lives,\" he declared.",

    "input": "(Mashable) -- Sometimes you just want to read. Digital's best answer for that simple urge is the now venerable E Ink e-reader. These monochromatic devices are not only holding on in the face of stiff LCD-based tablet competition, they're innovating. The latest update comes from Barnes & Noble, which added an LED-based \"GlowLight\" to its Nook Simple Touch e-reader. The 6.5 x 5-inch device is not remarkably different from the e-reader Barnes & Noble introduced last year. Its dimensions are, in fact, virtually unchanged. But despite the new lighting tech, this reader is actually 5% lighter than the previous model. It's also somewhat lighter than Amazon's Kindle Touch (6.975 ounces versus 7.5 ounces). Both Wi-Fi-only readers cost $139. You can get the Amazon Kindle Touch for $99, but then you have to accept special offers (essentially ads) in place of the screen savers. More importantly, the Simple Touch price includes the power adapter, while Kindle sells it separately for approximately $15. Still, what truly sets the latest Nook Simple Touch apart from all other E Ink-based e-readers is the patent-pending GlowLight. It makes the lightweight reader ready for night reading without the need for an overhead, clip-on or external light. By contrast, Amazon sells a cover with a built-in LED light for the Kindle Keyboard 3G. Barnes & Noble is not the first to offer an E Ink reader with built-in LED lighting. Sony did it first a few years ago, but eventually discontinued the larger and more expensive e-reader. The Simple Touch uses a single array of LED's nestled along the top edge of the device (above the screen, but below the touch-sensitive, anti-glare layer). They light the entire display. I put the ereader to the ultimate test: bedtime reading. My wife, who was beside me, read by the super-bright light of her Apple iPad 2. I held the much smaller ereader in my hand, and pressed the physical Nook \"n\" button for two seconds to enable the light . Nook Simple Touch's GlowLight is adjustable, via a touch-screen menu selection. So I cranked it all the way up (the default, which was set to about 1/3 power, was not bright enough for me). The light across the screen isn't perfectly uniform, but it is highly readable and very comfortable on the eyes. Even after my wife powered down and went to sleep, she didn't complain about my GlowLight. I also found the touchscreen, which works either with a tap or a sweep of the finger (forward to turn the page and back to turn back the page), worked perfectly and made me wish my Kindle 2 was also a touch-screen device. Barnes & Noble promises that the Nook Simple Touch's battery life will last for 30 days with an hour of GlowLight-enabled reading a night. I've had the ereader a few days and charged it once. My original plan was to leave the GlowLight running and test if it could run, as Barnes & Noble told me, for 60 continuous hours. The device's own auto-sleep settings scuttled that plan by putting the Simple Touch to sleep after five minutes of inactivity. Overall, Barnes & Noble Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight is a winner. It's easy to setup (entering a Wi-Fi password is easy thanks to the touch screen), feels great in the hand, slips into my back pocket and holds thousands of books. The interface is smartly designed. I like the store design and how easy it is to buy things (pretty much a match for the Kindle store) and found the E Ink screen crisp and responsive. My only tiny criticism is the power button on the back. You use it to fully turn off the device (and turn it on) and it wiggles a bit too much for my taste. The good news is that, considering the battery life, it's unlikely you'll use it very often. If I were buying a new E Ink reader right now, I'd go for the Barnes & Noble Simple Touch with GlowLight. It's slightly more affordable than the Kindle Touch (when you include the charger), feature-sensible and now has the killer enhancement: a built-in light. Those who pre-ordered the e-reader could receive it as early as this week. Barnes & Noble reps tell us that limited quantities of the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight will be available in stores next month. What do you think? Would you buy this E Ink e-reader or have you permanently moved on to tablets? Share your thoughts in the comments. See the original article on Mashable.com . Â© 2011 MASHABLE.com.

    "input": "(CNN) -- Before Saturday, a Florida teenager who sent or received nude photos or video could have been charged with a felony and forced to register as a sex offender. But a new law, recognizing the proliferation of cell phones and computers, eases the penalties for \"sexting\" infractions. A first offense is punishable by eight hours of community service or a $60 fine; the second is a misdemeanor and the third is a felony. State Rep. Joseph Abruzzo, D-Wellington, sponsored the legislation, which was approved in June. \"When our child pornography laws were written, they failed to take into account advances in technology, such as cell phones,\" Abruzzo said in a statement published on the website of CNN affiliate WPBF in West Palm Beach. \"(This bill) modernizes these laws to ensure that children's lives are not ruined due to youthful indiscretion. This reform will let our youth know that such behavior is wrong without labeling them sex offenders for the rest of their lives.\" CNN could not immediately reach Abruzzo for comment Saturday. Under House Bill 75, teens who receive explicit images won't be charged if they took reasonable steps to report it, did not solicit the image and did not send it to someone. A recent Associated Press/MTV poll of Internet behavior found one of three teen and young adult respondents said they've taken part in \"sexting,\" which includes sending sexually charged texts. The survey is part of MTV's \"A Thin Line\" campaign, a multi-year effort to stamp out digital abuse. Seventy-one percent of the survey's respondents said that \"sexting\" is a problem for Web users their age. Ten percent of respondents who said they'd exchanged sexual messages said they'd done so with people they know only online -- a steep drop from the 29 percent who said they'd done so in 2009. \"There's probably a lot of kids who don't realize how this (sexting) could impact their life,\" Karl Bergstrom of Fort Myers told CNN affiliate WINK.",

PlayStation Home, which can be downloaded free of charge, will allow PS3 gamers to interact, communicate and share gaming experiences through their own personal \"avatars,\" or three-dimensional virtual representations of themselves. Users will be able to chat to each other in Home Square -- a kind of PlayStation clubhouse -- before heading over to the bowling alley to bowl, play pool or use the gaming arcade. They will also be able to access music and video. Users will eventually be able to customize their avatars and virtual apartments with the latest virtual clothing from designers such as Diesel and furniture maker Ligne Roset. Sony also plans to introduce Red Bull Island, where users can jump into the cockpit of a Red Bull Air Race plane and compete against other Home users. \"The idea behind Home is to create a virtual space for PS3 owners to meet up, talk and play games - the easiest way to think of it is as a hybrid of Facebook, Second Life and the prettiest game lobby ever,\" Tim Clark, editor in chief at Official PlayStation Magazine UK, told the BBC. All you need to download Home is a PlayStation Network account and access to PlayStation Store. Providing you have the latest system software update installed, the Home icon will appear under PlayStation Network on the PS3 Home Menu (XMB). \"PlayStation Home is truly a promising network community service on the PlayStation platform, made possible with a combination of the power of PS3 and the PlayStation Network that covers many countries around the globe,\" said Kazuo Hirai, President and Group CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment on the company's Web site.",
