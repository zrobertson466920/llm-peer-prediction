    "objective  individuals with type 1 diabetes have decreased bone mineral density ( bmd ) , yet the natural history and pathogenesis of osteopenia are unclear . \n we have previously shown that women with type 1 diabetes ( aged 1335 years ) have lower bmd than community age - matched nondiabetic control subjects . \n we here report 2-year follow - up bmd data in this cohort to determine the natural history of bmd in young women with and without diabetes.research design and methods  bmd was measured by dual - energy x - ray absorptiometry at baseline and 2 years later in 63 women with type 1 diabetes and in 85 age - matched community control subjects . \n a1c , igf-1 , igf binding protein-3 , serum osteocalcin , and urine n - teleopeptide were measured at follow-up.resultsafter adjusting for age , bmi , and oral contraceptive use , bmd at year 2 continued to be lower in women 20 years of age with type 1 diabetes compared with control subjects at the total hip , femoral neck , and whole body . \n lower bmd values were observed in cases < 20 years of age compared with control subjects ; however , the differences were not statistically significant . \n lower bmd did not correlate with diabetes control , growth factors , or metabolic bone markers.conclusionsthis study confirms our previous findings that young women with type 1 diabetes have lower bmd than control subjects and that these differences persist over time , particularly in women 20 years of age . \n persistence of low bmd as well as failure to accrue bone density after age 20 years may contribute to the increased incidence of osteoporotic hip fractures seen in postmenopausal women with type 1 diabetes .",
    "- The study recruited female participants from a cross-sectional analysis of bone mineral density (BMD) in young women with type 1 diabetes and age-matched controls, involving 138 baseline participants aged 13-21 and later follow-up assessments two years later.\n- Participants completed questionnaires regarding health, lifestyle, and diabetes management, and BMD was measured using DEXA scans at multiple sites with consistent technician performance throughout the study.\n- At follow-up, while younger participants (<20 years) showed no significant difference in BMD changes between diabetic and control groups, older women with diabetes exhibited significantly lower BMD at the total hip and femoral neck compared to controls.\n- The study maintained a high retention rate for participants, with 87.5% of diabetic subjects and 93.4% of controls participating in both baseline and follow-up assessments, and results were adjusted for variables such as age, BMI, and oral contraceptive use.",

    "- The study involved recruiting female participants aged 13-39 from a pediatric diabetes center and endocrinology practices in Western New York to assess bone mineral density (BMD) in young women with type 1 diabetes compared to age-matched controls. Initial recruitment included 138 young female patients, followed by a follow-up study two years later where 63 diabetic and 85 non-diabetic participants completed assessments.\n\n- Participants completed extensive questionnaires on health, lifestyle, dietary habits, and fracture history, and BMD was measured using DEXA scans at multiple anatomical sites. Rigorous quality control was maintained for the scans, and biomarkers such as serum osteocalcin and IGF-1 were analyzed.\n\n- At follow-up, results indicated that while younger participants (<20 years) in both groups showed increases in BMD, older diabetic women (â‰¥20 years) exhibited significantly lower BMD at the total hip and femoral neck compared to controls. Adjusted analyses confirmed these differences remained significant even after accounting for potential confounders like age, BMI, and oral contraceptive use.\n\n- The demographic profile of participants was predominantly non-Hispanic Caucasian, with notable differences in BMI and insulin therapy between diabetic and control subjects, alongside a higher prevalence of diabetes-related complications in the older cohort. The study highlighted the need for continued monitoring of BMD in women with type 1 diabetes, particularly as they age.",
