  "reference": "cancer places a huge burden on society and has been identified as the leading cause of death in both more and less economically developed countries . \n projections based on the globocan 2012 estimates predict a substantive increase to 19.3 million new cancer cases per year by 2025 , due to growth and ageing of the global population . \n south africa , like other developing countries , is also experiencing an increase in the overall burden of disease attributable to cancer , with the number of new cancer cases predicted to increase by 46% by 2030 . \n this is likely to result in an increase in the use of cancer chemotherapy agents , which assist in preventing the proliferation , invasion , and metastases of the cancer cells . \n the basis for chemotherapy is anticancer drugs containing platinum , that is , cisplatin ( cis - diamminedichloroplatinum ii ) and carboplatin ( cis - diammine 1,1-cyclobutane dicarboxylatoplatinum ii ) . \n other chemotherapy drugs include nitrogen mustard , amino - nicotinamide , dichloromethotrexate , bleomycin , and 5-fluorouracil [ 5 , 6 ] . \n the first of these drugs , that is , cisplatin , consists of a divalent pt ( ii ) central atom and four ligands of cis - positioned pairs of chlorine atoms or amine groups . \n since its discovery in the 1970s , cisplatin continues to be hailed as one of the most potent cancer chemotherapeutics in children and adults , as it is unique and unmatched in its effectiveness against many cancers , namely , osteogenic sarcoma , medulloblastoma , testicular , cervical , and ovarian cancers . \n similarly , its toxicity profile is expansive , involving the gastrointestinal , hematologic , renal , and auditory systems . \n while the use of saline hydration and mannitol diuresis may prevent nephrotoxicity , neurotoxicity is still not curable or preventable . \n ototoxicity refers to the hearing disorder that results from the temporary or permanent inner ear dysfunction after treatment with an ototoxic drug . \n other drug classes known to have ototoxic properties include aminoglycosides , loop diuretics , quinine , nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs , and antiretroviral therapy ( art ) . \n this is of concern in south africa , as it is estimated that 12.2% of the population ( 6.4 million persons ) were hiv positive in 2012 , which is 1.2 million more people living with hiv than in 2008 ( 10.6% , or 5.2 million ) . \n resultantly , art exposure had almost doubled from 16.6% in 2008 to 31.2% in 2012 . \n not only will many infected people be at risk for ototoxicity due to arts , but a large number will also be susceptible to hiv - related cancers , such as kaposi 's sarcoma , non - hodgkin 's lymphoma , and cervical cancer , as well as infectious diseases such as tuberculosis , conditions that often require pharmacological therapy with the adverse side effect of ototoxicity . \n it is possible that their treatments could consist of simultaneous use of more than one ototoxic drug , increasing the likelihood of ototoxicity . \n all health care professionals managing patients with cancer should therefore be knowledgeable about the ototoxic properties of cisplatin . \n however , malhotra   indicated that most oncologists in india do not make referrals for audiological evaluations of patients receiving cisplatin , while a study in south africa revealed that the effects of ototoxicity , the role of audiologists , and need for their expertise were not fully realized by the oncologists sampled . \n this is further supported by evidence from the south african study of khoza - shangase and jina   which indicated that most general practitioners sampled also do not appear to carry out ototoxicity monitoring strategies , despite being aware of their own role within an ototoxicity monitoring programme . \n this review therefore aims to serve as resource for health professionals to enhance their understanding of ototoxicity as well as their roles within an ototoxicity monitoring programme by providing an overview and description of this condition in patients diagnosed with cancer and receiving cisplatin chemotherapy . \n the review identified peer - reviewed articles available from january 1975 to july 2015 on the topic of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity and ototoxicity monitoring and included english articles only . \n the same researcher conducted the literature search and reviewed the abstracts and articles for inclusion in the study . \n studies were identified using keyword and mesh term searches of electronic databases depicted in table 1 . a manual search of relevant authors and journals \n the references cited by each publication , review , or book chapter were reviewed in order to locate additional potential publications . in order to be selected , the article had to present data on either cisplatin ototoxicity and/or ototoxicity monitoring in human participants , and no research designs were excluded . running these searches yielded a total of 2106 records , of which 1581 were excluded based on the title and/or abstract as well as duplication . \n eighty - five relevant articles , comprising six national and 79 international articles , were selected . \n a perusal of narrative reviews of other auditory pathologies was conducted in an attempt to determine areas of significance for an overview of cisplatin ototoxicity . \n this resulted in the following eight areas being included : the mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity , clinical presentation , risk factors , incidence rates in adults and children , the effect on quality of life , ototoxicity monitoring , otoprotective strategies , and management of an ototoxic hearing loss . \n one such mechanism , the antioxidant model , involves the formation of reactive oxygen species ( ros ) within the cochlea and consequent reduction in antioxidant enzymes following exposure to cisplatin chemotherapy [ 1620 ] . \n another mechanism of cisplatin ototoxicity involves the significant contribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 3 isoform ( nox3 ) to the generation of reactive oxygen species within the cochlea , when activated by cisplatin [ 17 , 21 ] , while a third mechanism relates to the activation of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 channel ( trpv1 ) [ 2224 ] . \n the molecular mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity therefore include the following:creation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation ands - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  .with the cellular mechanisms of cisplatin - associated ototoxicity including damage to the outer hair cells , supporting cells , marginal cells of the stria vascularis , spiral ligament , and the spiral ganglion cells , it is evident that the structures of the inner ear are most susceptible to damage by cisplatin chemotherapy , with apoptotic degeneration of the hair cell in the organ of corti being most prominent . \n the outer hair cells in the basal turn of the cochlea are most affected [ 27 , 28 ] . \n this leads to an initial elevation of high frequency audiometric thresholds , followed by a progressive loss into the lower frequencies with continued therapy [ 27 , 28 ] . \n knowledge of the different mechanisms of cisplatin ototoxicity is important for health care professionals as it will create an awareness of its complexity and the resulting clinical presentation . \n creation of reactive oxygen species , depletion of antioxidant glutathione and its regenerating enzymes , increased rate of lipid peroxidation , oxidative modifications of proteins , nucleic acids damage by caspase system activation and s - nitrosylation of cochlear proteins  . \n cisplatin - associated ototoxicity usually manifests as irreversible , progressive , bilateral , high frequency sensorineural hearing loss   with tinnitus . \n the latter may occur with or without a hearing loss   and may be permanent or transient , sometimes disappearing a few hours after treatment   or alternatively persisting a week after treatment . while most of the hearing loss is permanent , there is sometimes sporadic and partial recovery . in addition , \n rare cases of unilateral hearing loss have been reported , which are usually explained by tumour location and surgical or therapeutic intervention on the affected side . moreover \n , the hearing loss is not always symmetrical [ 33 , 34 ] , with jenkins et al .   finding that 75% of women on cisplatin chemotherapy displayed an asymmetry of hearing thresholds of at least 10  db between ears posttreatment . \n schmidt et al . , in their investigation of 55 children on cisplatin chemotherapy , found that the high frequency hearing thresholds were slightly elevated in the left ear and that males had a greater degree of hearing loss than the females . \n the degree of hearing loss is often variable and is related to the do...",
