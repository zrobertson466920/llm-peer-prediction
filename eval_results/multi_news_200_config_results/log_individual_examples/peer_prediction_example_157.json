    "– Not again: Another American has been accused of illegally hunting wildlife in Zimbabwe. Officials there say in a press release that Jan Casmir Sieski of Murrysville, Pa., joined a hunt in April near Hwange National Park, where an American dentist recently coaxed out and killed a famous lion. The New York Times finds no Jan Casmir Sieski on record, but spotted a Jan Casimir Seski running a gynecological oncologist practice in Pittsburgh. The AP knocked on his door in a wooded area near Pittsburgh, and called his practice, but hasn't heard back. Meanwhile, pictures on social media (now removed) show the 68-year-old posing with wildlife he apparently killed in Africa, including antelope and elephants. The AP says he's specifically accused of illegal lion-hunting. Seski's neighbors describe him as mostly a loner. One says he's \"quirky\" and carries a low-slung handgun \"like a gunslinger,\" but adds that \"I've never seen him done anything illegal or unsportsmanlike at all.\" Turns out Seski pleaded guilty to allowing $973,795 in unapproved, foreign oncology drugs into the US between 2008 and 2011, the Daily News reports. According to an official document, he was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine. He's also seen as a trailblazer in bloodless surgery. Now Zimbabwe officials have arrested the farm owner who allegedly conducted the April hunt, and stopped all hunting of elephants, leopards, and lions outside Hwange National Park.",
