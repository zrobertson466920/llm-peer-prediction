  "reference": "rising levels of obesity are becoming a worldwide phenomenon and are increasingly identified as a health problem across the globe [ 14 ] . \n higher weight has been associated with adverse health indicators and outcomes , including cardiovascular disease [ 512 ] , stroke [ 5 , 13 ] , cognitive and functional decline [ 1418 ] , metabolic syndrome [ 19 , 20 ] , inflammation [ 21 , 22 ] , and mortality [ 20 , 2325 ] . \n obesity among aging populations is relatively recent and aging among people who have been obese for much of their lives is also a new phenomenon . from 1980 to 2004 , the prevalence of obesity in the us has continued to rise from about 17% to 25% for men aged 5059 . while obesity in england has also increased during this period , from approximately 9% in 1980 to 15% in 2004 for men aged 5564 , the level of obesity remains much lower in england . \n additionally , the difference in obesity between the us and england is more pronounced for women . \n the level of obesity in us women was about 24% in 1980 and rose to 37% in 2004 ( age 5059 ) ; in england , levels for women were 9% in 1980 and 14% in 2004 ( age 5564 ) . \n the aim of this paper is to investigate differences in how obesity relates to indicators of physiological dysregulation in men and women of diverse populations . \n this comparison will lead to an improved understanding of how obesity might be differentially related to health and mortality across cultures and lifestyles . \n obesity was relatively rare in most populations until the second part of the last century , but it has now become common in many countries \n . the us population is recognized as among the most obese in the world , although many other countries are now approaching the us level and most countries are experiencing increasing obesity . \n this worldwide obesity epidemic began with the epidemiological revolution and the virtual elimination of infectious disease ; the decline in manual labor needed to provide sustenance with the industrial revolution ; and the increasing availability and decreasing cost of food [ 2729 ] . \n obesity reflects some combination of calorie intake , diet content , and amount of physical activity . in some cultures , \n lack of physical activity can be a more important determinant of obesity ; in other cultures , overeating or food composition may be the more important determinant of obesity . \n it is also true that within countries , individuals could differ in the causes of obesity . \n for instance , changes in activity might be more characteristic of women or men resulting in different reasons for obesity by gender . \n these differences may affect how obesity is related to other risk factors for poor health , and it may determine the overall health risk associated with obesity . if physical activity is maintained , the overall effect of obesity may be less than if the activity is not . \n one indication of the cause of obesity may be the relationship between waist size and weight [ 30 , 31 ] . in societies where obese people are more physically active , waist size of the obese \n waist circumference has also been linked to late life mortality , where high waist circumference has been associated with increased mortality among men and women in the netherlands , while high bmi was not associated with mortality . \n this paper builds upon current obesity research by using both bmi and waist circumference to quantify obesity in order to determine how a combined indicator of weight and adiposity is related to physiological dysregulation in populations with different cultures , diets , behaviors , and epidemiological histories . \n obesity has been related to many indicators of physiological dysregulation including cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension   and metabolic dysregulation in lipid levels or insulin resistance . \n most studies that investigate the differences in biological risk associated with excess weight have examined western populations [ 33 , 36 ] . \n comparative studies on the health risks associated with obesity that examined the us and england reported that obese americans had an increased risk of diabetes and a higher waist circumference [ 37 , 38 ] . \n these studies suggested that differences in physical activity , diet , and social environments may explain these national differences . \n while these differences have been observed between the us and england , these two western countries have roughly similar life expectancy , levels of living , history , and culture even while the us has poorer health by a number of indicators of disease prevalence and biological risk [ 36 , 39 ] . \n comparative studies of the links between obesity and health outcomes and risk factors for obesity comparing western and non - western countries indicate important differences in the causes and consequences of obesity . \n a comparison of the association of disease with overweight and obesity in japan and the us indicated that the associations were stronger in the us than in japanese women and that there was no association in japanese men . \n links between social , demographic , and behavioral risk factors for obesity also differ markedly in japan , korea , and the us . \n the availability of biomarker data from taiwan  a middle - income country undergoing rapid economic growth , increasing obesity , and with life expectancy recently increasing to levels similar to that of the us and england  allows for investigation of the biological risk associated with obesity in a population characterized by very different cultural , behavioral , socioeconomic , and dietary parameters . \n we examine how elevated weight and obesity ( using an indicator that considers both bmi and waist circumference ) relate to having levels defined as clinical risk for cardiovascular , metabolic , and inflammatory markers in three aging societies that are now relatively similar in life expectancy but that differ in the timing of the epidemiological transition and obesity epidemic , history of economic development , socioeconomic levels , general lifestyle habits , health behaviors , and health care systems : the us , england , and taiwan . \n finding differences in the relationship between obesity and indicators of physiological dysregulation in these three aging societies will clarify whether increases in weight gain are equally problematic across all countries . \n we use data from three nationally representative samples : the us national health and nutrition examination survey ( nhanes , 20032006 ; n = 3855 ) , the english longitudinal study of ageing ( elsa , 2004 - 2005 ; n = 9139 ) , and the social environment and biomarkers of aging study ( sebas ) in taiwan ( 2000 ; n = 1023 ) . \n these surveys collect information on demographics , as well as anthropometric , physical , and biological measures . \n every year , approximately 5,000 individuals undergo detailed interviews and medical examinations , which include collection of several physiological measures . \n nhanes utilizes a complex sampling design , and when weights are applied , the sample is representative of the noninstitutionalized american population . \n we use the 20032006 data since nhanes data is released in two - year intervals , and this sample is centered on 2004 - 2005 , which matches the period in which elsa was collected . \n for nhanes , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 1,513 fasting individuals aged 54 and older . \n elsa includes participants drawn from households responding to the health survey for england ( hse ) in 1998 , 1999 , and 2001   and is representative of the english population aged 50 and older . \n the core elsa sample ( wave 1 : 2002 - 2003 ) includes people living in an hse responding household who were born prior to march 1 , 1952 , and their partners who could be under age 50 . wave 4 of elsa ( 2008 - 2009 ) , which includes a nurse visit , includes wave 1 core members , if they are still alive and do not refuse further contact after the first interview at wave 1 . \n it also includes a refresher sample to maintain the age structure of the sample ( in waves 3 and 4 ) , and their partners . for elsa , we use individual - level data based on a sample of 7,384 individuals aged 54 and older . \n sebas is drawn from a follow - up survey of the survey of health and living status of the near elderly and elderly in taiwan ( also known as the taiwan longitudinal study of aging ( tlsa ) ) , a nationally representative survey of taiwanese adults ( including institutionalized individuals ) collected in 1989 , 1993 , 1996 , 1999 , and 2000 . in 2000 , a subsample of individuals was randomly selected for inclusion in sebas . \n sebas consists of adults aged 54 and older in 2000 , with in - home interviews and medical exams taken in a hospital . for sebas , \n the sample averages 66.8 years of age in england , and the us and taiwan mean age is about the same ( table 1 ) . \n there are more men in taiwan ( 56% ) an...",
