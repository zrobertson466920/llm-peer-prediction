    "– Authorities believe a teen couple murdered last month in Pakistan was killed by electrocution—an extremely rare method of death in so-called honor killings, the BBC reports. The bodies of a 15-year-old girl and 17-year-old boy were exhumed from a grave site in Karachi, and a postmortem examination was conducted Wednesday, according to Dawn. Authorities say marks on the victims' arms, chests, and legs indicate they were killed by electrocution. Four people—the fathers and uncles of the victims—have been arrested in connection with the murders. Authorities say the four have confessed to killing the teens and claim they were pressured by tribal elders to do so in order to protect the honor of the tribe. Authorities say the couple, who sought to marry, ran away from home Aug. 14 but were informed on by a relative. The News reports the two families tried to settle the matter themselves, with the girl's family agreeing to an offer of two girls for marriage and a cow from the boy's family in exchange for the victims' marriage. But one tribal elder reportedly quashed the deal, telling the families they must kill their children to prevent such behavior in the future. Police are currently looking for the tribal elder. Authorities say the girl was electrocuted Aug. 15 and the boy Aug. 16. The bodies were buried in the middle of the night. The family members were arrested Aug. 21. Advocacy groups say honor killings are increasing in Pakistan with women being the most frequent victims. (Five teens in Pakistan were allegedly killed for the crime of clapping and dancing.)",
