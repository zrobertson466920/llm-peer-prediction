    "– The Manhattan hotel maid accusing IMF boss Dominique Strauss-Kahn of sexual assault picked him out of a police lineup yesterday, reports the New York Times. Strauss-Kahn was taken to the Manhattan Special Victims Unit in East Harlem where DNA evidence was collected from his skin and beneath his fingernails, authorities said. Strauss-Kahn is due to be arraigned later today, where he is expected to be allowed to post bail. Due to worries that he may attempt to flee the country, however, bail is expected to be in the millions of dollars. Strauss-Kahn had been widely considered the leading candidate in this year's French presidential race, reports AP. Supporters wear T-shirts that read \"Yes we Kahn,\" a play on Barack Obama's famous \"Yes we can\" slogan of 2008. Strauss-Kahn has been dubbed \"the great seducer\" for his love life by the French media, but reports of his affairs had not hurt his presidential bid. But now, his stunned Socialist party has been thrown into chaos. \"It's totally hallucinating,\" said one of Strauss-Kahn's rivals. \"If true, this would be a historic moment in the negative sense for French political life.\" For more on the crime, check here.",
