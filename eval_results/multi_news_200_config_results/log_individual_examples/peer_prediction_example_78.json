    "– St. Louis County police haven't released audio regarding the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown, but the hacker collective Anonymous took care of that today, reports Mashable. The lengthy file released on YouTube shows the progression of events after an officer shot the unarmed teen in the suburb of Ferguson. As Mother Jones notes, the first hint of trouble comes more than nine minutes into the recording, with the dispatcher making a request for crowd control. But the circumstances were still unclear as to why at that point. Some excerpts, with the bold referring to the time of the audio recording: 9:35: \"Ferguson is asking for assistance with crowd control ...\" 10:58: \"Now they have a large group gathering there, she doesn't know any further ...\" 11:20: \"We just got another call stating it was an officer-involved shooting. ... Be advised, this information came from the news ,,, 21:55: \"They are requesting more cars. Do you want me to send more of your cars?\" 43:55: \"Attention all cars, be advised that in reference to the call 2947 Canfield Drive, we are switching over to the riot channel at this time ...\" Police say they are aware of the audio and are investigating how it became public. Anonymous is also trying to identify the officer involved, reports the New York Daily News. Ferguson's police chief has balked at doing that so far because the six-year veteran has gotten death threats. (The FBI has launched an investigation into the shooting.)",
