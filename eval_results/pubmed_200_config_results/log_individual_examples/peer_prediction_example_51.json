  "reference": "older people have particular spiritual needs that are distinct from those of others , particularly in times of ill health and death and dying . \n it has been reported that spirituality has a positive effect on health outcomes and welfare of the elderly . \n nowadays , aging phenomenon and relevant problems with its complexities are important issues that have attracted the attention of social and medical scientists to investigate the spiritual needs of the elderly . \n spiritual health is a dimension of health that is portrayed as the validation of life in relation to god , fellow human beings , and the environment . \n spirituality is the representative of the basic values that guide a person in searching to find answers to the crucial questions of life , such as the purpose and meaning of life , reality , love , good and bad , disease , and death .   over the past three decades , spirituality , religion , and prayer \n have turned into a subject of large interest for researchers in medicine , nursing , gerontology , physical health and mental health disciplines , often in conjunction with complementary and alternative medicine . \n this tendency has been stimulated by research demonstrating physical and psychological benefits of spiritual and religious involvements . \n in fact , approximately 96% of adults in the united states expressed their belief in god , and 72% of identified religion and spirituality as having the most important influence in their lives . saying prayers is a regular daily task for muslims which begins at the age of puberty and continues throughout the life . \n it is a time getting rid of the material world and approaching the world beyond , as well as , to the inner self . in iran , elderly people are more religious than younger ones , and this is a norm of this culture . \n a recent national survey of the iranians values and attitudes found that over 80% of the iranians practice prayer regularly as a part of their religion . \n one might argue that this is a true reflection of individual culture where prayer and religious beliefs are a part of people 's everyday life . \n however , prayer can go beyond just performing a religious duty , and based on one 's wishes , take different forms of formal and informal practices . \n it has been shown that disease prevalence , incidence and mortality rates differ from one population to another . \n this is partly ascribed to their disparities in lifestyle , dietary habits and other characteristics that are somehow affected by culture , especially religious traditions and experiences .   during the past two decades \n some studies have been carried out and the associations between religious beliefs or experiences and various types of physical illnesses , mental health , and mortality have been examined . \n spirituality is viewed as personally important matter to the older people and it has been proved that it is highly related to older people 's health outcomes . \n however , there has not been adequate experiential research on the relationship between religious or spiritual factors and healthy lifestyle behaviors , and their impact on the adult 's well - being . \n scientists believe that probing the effects of religious and spiritual factors as well as healthy lifestyle behaviors may be decisive . \n additionally , social science and medical research have concurrently reported that older adults are more inclined to take spiritual chase than younger people are . \n kotrotsiou - barboutal et al.(2006 ) indicated that older adults are remaining members of religious associations without necessarily participating regularly in services , as there are numerous issues that can diminish the active participation in religious events , such as transportation intricacies , bad sound , or the illegibility of small font text in books of prayers available at mosques or religious centers . in spite of those complexities , \n many elderly manage to find out a way to come up to god through prayer . \n it is stated that prayer increases the feelings of personal value of an elderly by reducing the feelings of loneliness and desertation , while television and radio provide support for spiritual life .   in this regard , researchers have shown that some groups of elderly people with inadequate and difficult livelihood situations communicate their problems by putting their trust in god . moreover , more than half of the elder patients practiced spiritual needs throughout their hospitalization period , with the most prominent need of being in the search of the meaning of life . \n extensive epidemiological studies have shown that higher levels of religiousness are related to lower mortality rates . \n studies identified the multidimensional nature of religiousness and spirituality and investigated various religious dimensions , for instance private religious behaviors , devotion , spiritual transcendence , and religious adaptation . \n for example , it was indicated that some aspects of religiousness predicted lower rates of disability and illness , alcoholism , cardiovascular disease , hypertension , and myocardial infarction . \n furthermore , clinical research has suggested that spirituality can play a vital role in the recovery of patients suffering from physical and psychological diseases . \n it seems that religious obligation has a crucial role in averting physical and mental diseases , recovery promotion , and disease adaptation . \n numerous studies have revealed the positive involvement of spirituality and religious indexes on different aspects of health such as cardiac surgery , mortality , immunity system function and self esteem . \n above all , religious involvement can be useful for psychological well - being and physical health . \n additionally , supporting the effect of spirituality may become more and more prominent in later life as a result of declining health , social and financial sources . \n researchers have proposed numerous psychological , social , and physiological interveners that may explain the spirituality - health association . \n quantitative measurements and the evaluation of spiritual beliefs are difficult because quantitative studies neither reveal the content , components of the beliefs , and its factors , nor the contexts that might be included . therefore , implementing qualitative research that explores the personal and experiential aspects of beliefs seems crucial , and may shed light on a range of important issues which can be investigated in detail on larger samples by further quantitative studies in future . \n spiritual or religious beliefs may affect the decisions of individuals that make about their health and illness . \n thus , recognizing and understanding the spiritual and religious behaviors within the context of cultural influence by a qualitative research is critical for nurse and other health - care providers . \n the main strengths of the present study are that it focuses on the spiritual life of healthy elderly people . \n therefore , the present study aimed to explore the concept of spirituality from the perspectives of iranian healthy elderly people . the central question of the paper was  what characterizes the spirituality in the iranian healthy older people ? \n in this research , a qualitative approach was adopted using conventional content analysis of unstructured interviews carried out with 17 healthy elderly people in tehran in 2010 - 2011 . \n it is worth noting that spirituality is underpinned by personal and cultural context in any community ; therefore , qualitative research is the best method to study cultural context - bound subjects . \n initially purposeful sampling was used and continued with purposeful sampling according to the codes and categories emerged from data . \n the study consisted of 17 healthy elders within the age range of 65 - 86 . \n criteria for selection were having age above 65 , living with family , not having any cognitive problems , not having any physical limitation in adl , and willingness to participate in the study . \n all participants were shia muslims . in order to achieve the wide range of experiences and perceptions of elderly participants , some field notes writing and 21 interviews were conducted according to emerged codes and categories from data . the first researcher communicated with each of the participants to describe the purpose of research and research questions . \n based on the participants preference , the interviews were performed in a private room at the house of elderly , park , worksite , or mosque , using an individual semi - structured interview format and this was primarily the main method for data collection . \n interview query consisted of open - ended questions to allow respondents thoroughly to describe their opinions , perceptions , and experiences . \n the participants were asked to describe one day of their life and then to explain their own experiences and perceptions about  spirituality in elderl...",
