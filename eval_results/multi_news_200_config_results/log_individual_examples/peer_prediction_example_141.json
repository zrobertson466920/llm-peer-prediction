    "– Three teenage suspects are dead and their alleged getaway driver is in custody after what police in Broken Arrow, Okla., are calling an apparent home invasion. Police say that after the three suspects broke in through a glass door at the back of the home Monday afternoon, there was a \"short exchange of words\" with the homeowner's 23-year-old son before he opened fire with an AR-15 assault rifle, KTUL reports. Two suspects died in the home's kitchen. A third fled before collapsing and dying in the home's driveway. Police say that hours after the shooting, Elizabeth Marie Rodriguez, 21, turned herself in. She was arrested and is expected to face three charges of first-degree murder and three charges of burglary. (In Oklahoma, those suspected in a felony that results in a death can face charges of murder.) Wagoner County Deputy Nick Mahoney says the three teenagers were wearing black clothing, masks, and gloves when they broke into the home, the AP reports. Two of the suspects were 17 years old and the third was 18, reports FOX23. One suspect had brass knuckles and another had a knife, according to police, who say the homeowners called authorities and voluntarily provided statements. Police say there's no indication that the suspects knew the homeowner or his son. They say that, for now, the shooting is being treated as self-defense. \"This may be a case of 'stand-your-ground'; however, it's still too early to say for sure, and we're still looking into all aspects of this,\" Mahoney says, per the Tulsa World.",
