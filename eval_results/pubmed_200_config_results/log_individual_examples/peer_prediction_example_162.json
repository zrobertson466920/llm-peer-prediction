    "introduction : trichotillomania ( ttm ) is characterized by patchy alopecia of hair bearing areas . this is because of compulsive urge to pull the hair . \n scalp is the most common site for pulling hair . \n usually , patients may have only small areas of baldness , in severe forms , tonsure pattern of baldness is observed . \n diagnosis is by history and clinical examination . \n however , it is difficult to differentiate from other causes of noncicatricial alopecia . here , authors observed trichoscopic patterns and evaluated their importance in the diagnosis of ttm.materials and methods : this study was conducted in s. nijalingappa medical college , bagalkot , from january 2014 to july 2014 . \n ten patients with clinically suspected ttm were included in the study . \n informed consent was taken and ethical clearance was obtained . \n dermlite3 dermoscope was used with sony camera attachment to save the images . \n histopathological examination was conducted in all the patients to confirm the diagnosis.results:ten patients were included in the study . \n mean age of the patients was 34 years . \n most common symptom was patchy loss of hair in the frontal area ( 100% ) . \n common trichoscopic feature was decreased hair density and broken hairs . \n trichoptilosis ( split ends ) and irregular coiled hairs were seen in 80% patients . \n novel diagnostic signs like black dots , flame hair , v - sign , follicular hemorrhages , were seen in 30% each . \n tulip hair and hair powder were observed in 10% of patients . \n all patients had the noninflammatory alopecia with distorted and collapsed inner root sheath in histopathology.conclusion:trichotillomania is often chronic and difficult to treat . hence \n , early diagnosis and treatment is necessary . \n authors believe that the trichoscopy plays a vital role in the diagnosis of this condition by demonstrating specific trichoscopic patterns .",
    "- Trichotillomania (TTM) is a chronic impulse control disorder characterized by repetitive hair pulling, often resulting in patchy alopecia, primarily observed in adolescents and adults, especially females.  \n- The study evaluated trichoscopic patterns in 10 patients diagnosed with TTM, identifying specific patterns such as decreased hair density and broken hairs, which aid in early diagnosis.  \n- Key findings included novel diagnostic signs like black dots, flame hairs, and the \"V-sign,\" observed in varying frequencies among patients, highlighting the importance of trichoscopy in differentiating TTM from other hair loss conditions.  \n- Histopathological examination confirmed non-inflammatory alopecia with distorted follicular anatomy, supporting the diagnosis of TTM, especially when clinical manifestations overlapped with conditions like alopecia areata.

    "- The study focused on trichotillomania (TTM), a chronic impulse control disorder characterized by repetitive hair pulling, and utilized trichoscopy as a diagnostic tool to identify specific patterns associated with TTM in 10 patients at a tertiary hospital in Bagalkot, South India, between January and July 2014.\n- The mean age of participants was 34 years, with a range from 13 to 55 years, and the mean duration of the disorder was 19 months (ranging from 2 to 36 months). All patients exhibited patchy hair loss on the scalp, particularly in the frontal area.\n- Trichoscopic examination revealed common findings such as decreased hair density and hairs broken at varying lengths in all patients, with additional patterns like coiled hairs, upright re-growing hairs, and novel diagnostic signs such as black dots and flame hairs observed in a subset of patients.\n- Histopathological analysis confirmed noninflammatory alopecia, with findings including distorted and collapsed inner root sheaths, and the absence of significant inflammation, which aids in differentiating TTM from other hair loss conditions like alopecia areata.",
    "- The study investigates trichotillomania (TTM), a chronic impulse control disorder characterized by repetitive hair pulling, primarily affecting the scalp, with specific emphasis on identifying trichoscopic patterns unique to TTM that can aid in early diagnosis. The research was conducted on 10 patients at a tertiary dermatology department in South India, documenting demographic and clinical data, including age, gender, site of lesions, and disease duration.\n\n- Utilizing a DermLite 3 dermoscope, the researchers observed various trichoscopic features, such as decreased hair density, broken hairs of varying lengths, coiled hairs, and other novel patterns like \"black dots,\" \"flame hairs,\" and the \"V-sign.\" These features were identified in all patients and are considered specific to TTM, contrasting with other forms of alopecia like alopecia areata.\n\n- The mean age of patients was 34 years, with a mean disease duration of 19 months. All patients exhibited patchy hair loss predominantly in the frontal scalp area, and some reported pulling or eating their hair, with one patient displaying signs of trichophagia. Histopathological examination confirmed noninflammatory alopecia with distorted hair follicles.\n\n- The study highlights the diagnostic challenges posed by TTM due to overlapping clinical features with other hair loss conditions, particularly alopecia areata. It underscores the importance of trichoscopy as a noninvasive tool for differentiating TTM from other alopecias, supported by histopathological findings that reveal characteristic changes in hair follicles resulting from compulsive hair pulling.",
