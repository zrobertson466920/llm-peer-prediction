    "– A historic victory for the separatist Parti Quebecois was marred by an attack on a victory rally for premier-elect Pauline Marois. A man opened fire during her victory speech, killing one person and critically wounding another, reports CTV. The suspect, a man in his 50s, then started a fire and ran away. He was pursued by firefighters and held until police arrived. Witnesses reported hearing the man say—in French—\"That's enough\" and \"The Anglos are waking up,\" the Globe and Mail reports. After nine years in opposition, the Parti Quebecois won a minority mandate in the Canadian province's election. Leaders have promised to confront the federal government and win more powers for the province. Another pro-independence referendum is a possibility, although polls show support for independence is much lower than in 1995, when the pro-independence side lost a referendum by a margin of just 1%. \"I have convictions and I am going to defend them,\" Marois said during her victory speech. \"There will be a referendum when the Quebec population wants a referendum.\"",
