  "reference": "according to the u.s . national institutes of health , up to 80% of human bacterial infections involve biofilm - associated microorganisms 1 . among these , implant - related infections \n do still have a tremendous impact in orthopaedics and trauma 2 , with high social and economic costs 3 , 4 , posing challenging diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas 5 . \n in fact , peri - prosthetic joint infection ( pji ) remains one of the most feared complications in orthopaedic surgery and among the first reasons for implant failure 6 . \n moreover , given the increasing number of hip and knee arthroplasties performed , the prevalence of this complication is rising , with increasing costs for national health systems and increasing biological costs for the patients , such as loss or reduced joint function and deterioration in their physical and psychological health 7 . according to the widely accepted model of the ' race for the surface ' for pji development , \n host and bacterial cells compete for surface colonization , with a low probability of bacterial attachment if host cells adhere to implant first , and vice versa . in the event of bacterial adhesion to an implant , \n in addition , the matrix protects the biofilm cells from various microbicidal agents and stresses , including dehydration , toxins , ultraviolet light , chemical disinfectants , temperature and osmotic shock , and lead them to increased resistance against antimicrobials 9 , 10 . to address the limited efficacy of existing antibiotics in the treatment of established bacterial biofilms , novel approaches are required to prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation 11 . \n adhesion is a necessary first step in microbial colonization and pathogenesis and provides a good theoretical target for new preventive and treatment strategies 12 . \n bacterial adhesion to surfaces can be divided into a first , reversible phase and a second , irreversible phase . \n once an implant is inserted into the body , it is covered by a conditional protein layer composed of host proteins , such as albumin and complement , that act as a reservoir of several receptors for bacterial adhesive ligands , mediating adhesion of free - floating bacteria to the surface of the biomaterials 14 , 15 ; these first adhesions are , however mechanically and biologically unstable . \n few minutes after this first , reversible phase , bacterial clusters attached to the surface starts to express biofilm related genes , produce glycocalyx and form mature biofilm , thus transforming the adhesion from reversible to irreversible 16 . \n full - formed biofilm can be found few hours after the first bacterial adhesion 17 . \n antimicrobial surface coatings can be based on an anti - adhesive principle that prevents bacteria to adhere and form biofilms 18 . \n in fact , some polymer coatings , like the hydrophilic polymethacrylic acid , polyethylene oxide or protein - resistant polyethylene glycol can be applied to the surface of titanium implants and result in significant inhibition of bacterial adhesion 19 - 22 . \n hydrophobic and superhydrophobic surface treatment technologies have also shown a great repellent antibacterial effect in preclinical studies 23 - 25 . \n however , clinical application of completely novel coating technologies and compounds , not otherwise previously tested in humans , appears particularly challenging 26 . \n bacterial colonization can also be blocked by an inhibitor interfering with ligand - receptor interaction for bacterial attachment . \n one of these inhibitors could be hyaluronic acid ( ha ) , a glycosaminoglycan made up of glucuronic acid and n - acetylglucosamine disaccharide units . \n it is a uniform , linear and unbranched molecule , with highly variable length and molecular weight ( up to 106 da ) . \n it is abundant in skin ( up to 56% ) and in connective tissues , with a turnover ranging from several hours to a few days depending on tissues . \n hyaluronic acid constitutes one of the main components of extracellular matrices . because of its biological properties , ha has several clinical applications ( aesthetic surgery , dermatology , dentistry , orthopedics and opthalmology ) 27 . \n extensive studies on the chemical and physicochemical properties of ha and its physiological role in humans , together with its versatile properties , such as its biocompatibility , non - immunogenicity , biodegradability , and viscoelasticity , have proved that it is an ideal biomaterial for medical and pharmaceutical applications 28 , 29 . among its various properties , \n several studies have recently shown the ability of ha to protect against various infectious agents 30 , depending on ha concentration and molecular weight 31 , 32 , while more recently ha interference on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation has been extensively investigated 33 . \n given its high biocompatibility and well known safety profile and the anti - adhesive capabilities , ha and its composites represent an attractive , non - antibiotic , option to mitigate the impact of biofilm - related infections in various clinical settings including implant - related infections . aim of this review is to provide an update of the current evidence concerning ha ability to reduce / prevent bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation . \n nearly two decades ago , pavesio et al . 34 were probably the first to describe the ability of ha to resist bacterial adhesion , with particular reference to staphylococcus epidermidis , and its non - fouling properties 35 , proposing coated polymeric medical devices ( e.g. , intraocular lenses , stents and catheters ) to reduce implant - related infections . \n in particular , a hydrophilic ha overlayer , linked to the surface of polymethylmethacrylate intraocular lenses ( iols ) , was shown to be able to prevent fibroblasts adhesion and to greatly reduce staphyloccous epidermidis adhesion to the implant surface 36 . \n the impact of slime dispersants and anti - adhesives on in vitro biofilm formation on iols was further investigated by kadry and co - workers 37 , using a staphyloccous epidermidis wild strain , isolated from a patient with endophtalmitis ; the authors reported the ability of hyaluronan to reduce bacterial adhesion to iols to 30% , compared with untreated control cells . \n the authors suggested the use of adjuvant therapy such as dispersants or anti - adhesives , in addition to the antibiotics in irrigating solutions for bacterial ocular infections . \n more recently , the in vitro antiadhesive and antibiofilm activity of hyaluronic acid towards bacterial species commonly isolated from respiratory infections was investigated by drago et al . \n 33 . in this study , the interference exerted on bacterial adhesion was evaluated by using hep-2 cells , while the antibiofilm activity was assessed by means of spectrophotometry after incubation of biofilm with hyaluronic acid and staining with crystal violet . \n the experimental findings clearly demonstrated how hyaluronic acid is able to interfere with bacterial adhesion to a cellular substrate in a concentration - dependent manner . \n moreover , staphylococcus aureus biofilm was found to be more sensitive to the action of ha , compared to that produced by haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis . concerning more specifically the antimicrobial activity , ha \n has also been shown to exert varied bacteriostatic , but not bactericidal , dose - dependent effects on different microorganisms in the planktonic phase 31 , 38 . in this \n regard , radaeva et al . reported the inhibiting activity of ha with respect to some pseudomonas species 39 , while ardizzoni and co - workers 30 investigated the effects of ha on 15 atcc bacterial strains , representative of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal species . \n their results showed that different microbial species and , sometimes , different strains belonging to the same species , are differently affected by ha . in particular , staphylococci , enterococci , streptococcus mutans , two escherichia coli strains , pseudomonas aeruginosa , candida glabrata and c. parapsilosis displayed a ha dose - dependent growth inhibition , while no ha effects were detected in e. coli atcc 13768 and c. albicans and s. sanguinis was favoured by the highest ha dose . comparing the potential bacteriostatic effect of some of the most commonly used biomatrix materials ( collagen type i , hyaluronic acid , hydroxyapatite , polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid ) on the growth over the first 12h of exposure of some of the most common orthopaedic bacterial pathogens ( staphylococcus aureus , staphylococcus epidermidis , -hemolytic streptococcus , pseudomonas aeruginosa ) , carlson and co - workers 38 found that ha had the most significant bacteriostatic properties on the studied organisms . \n 31 investigated the potential bacteriostatic effect of hyaluronic acid in different concentrations and molecular weight on oral and non - oral m...",
