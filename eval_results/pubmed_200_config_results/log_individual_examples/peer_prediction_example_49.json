49% of patients with polycythemia vera experience thrombosis and 20 - 40% will die as a result2 ) . \n thromboembolism is one of the major complications of hip surgery and contributes to its poor prognosis . \n warwick et al.3 ) reported that the incidence rate for a deep vein thrombosis was about 1.89% if proper medication was not provided after total hip arthroplasty . \n therefore , in the case of the patient described in the current case report , it was reasonable to expect that she would be susceptible to the high incidence rate of thrombosis as she underwent the hip surgery based on her history of polycythemia vera . for prophylactic purposes , \n aspirin was administrated ( 100 mg daily ) and early exercise and active movements were recommended for the patient in order to lower the risk of venous thromboembolism . in the current case report , a patient with polycythemia vera exhibited clinical symptoms and signs of a postoperative infection following bipolar hemiarthroplasty due to femoral neck fractures . \n there was , however , a deep vein thrombosis which rendered the intravenous administration of antibiotics ineffective in the alleviation of symptoms . \n early symptoms of a deep vein thrombosis , including swelling , pain , oppressive pain , and a warm sensation , can mimic those of a postoperative infection . \n furthermore , features of systematic inflammatory responses such as increased levels of interleukin-6 , interleukin-8 , and crp may be observed in patients with a deep vein thrombosis . \n collectively , these findings suggest that appropriate clinical examinations are warranted at an early stage in order to avoid making an inaccurate diagnosis4,5 ) . on the first visit after the operation , \n the patient was suspected to have had a postoperative infection due to the simultaneous increase in esr and crp levels \n . however , the specificity of esr and cpr levels pertaining to the diagnosis of infections is questionable , as most patients display elevated levels of esr and crp following a hip surgery6 ) . \n these inflammatory responses stimulate the production of cytokines due to the fractures and operation per se , thus biochemical parameters for inflammation are known to be elevated in a non - specific manner . in cases without postoperative infections , elevated crp levels recover to the normal range within 3 weeks of the operation6,7 ) . in the current case report , the elevated crp level that was maintained for up to 24 days after the operation led us to suspect a postoperative infection . \n however , the abnormally increased level of acute phase reactants ( e.g. , crp ) may be observed in patients with chronic myeloproliferative diseases ( e.g. , polycythemia vera ) and therefore further specific clinical examinations are required for an infectious diagnosis8 ) . regarding the diagnosis of a postoperative infection , \n elevated level of serum procalcitonin may be more valuable than wbcs and crp levels7 ) . \n regrettably , the level of serum procalcitonin was not measured in the current case but could have been informative in distinguishing between postoperative infection and a deep vein thrombosis . despite the presentation of similar clinical symptoms between a postoperative infection and a deep vein thrombosis , their etiological mechanisms are completely distinct . therefore , \n different treatments are warranted , as patients receiving inappropriate medical treatments may experience exacerbated symptoms and conditions . \n the potential for a deep vein thrombosis requires continuous thought and attention regarding relevant examinations for patients at high risk for thrombosis as well as for embolism ( e.g. , polycythemia vera ) .",

    "- So, there’s this 68-year-old lady who had hip surgery recently and started feeling pain and swelling in her thigh, which got her worried. She thought it might be an infection since it felt warm, but her temp was normal. \n\n- Turns out, she had a history of a blood condition called polycythemia vera, which makes her blood thicker and puts her at risk for blood clots. After some tests, they found out she had a deep vein thrombosis (fancy term for a blood clot) in her leg, not an infection like they first thought.\n\n- They tried antibiotics, but they didn’t help because it was the clot causing her symptoms, not an infection. Once they switched gears and gave her some blood thinners, she started feeling better.\n\n- The whole situation highlights how tricky it can be to tell the difference between a post-surgery infection and a blood clot, especially for patients like her.
