    "– Mel Gibson seemed to be begging for it, and now it's come: his Beaver fallout begins. The actor's bid to resurrect his career playing a depressed dad who cures himself by talking to his beaver hand puppet has taken a hilarious turn on YouTube. Altered trailers for Gibson's new film no longer feature a kindly beaver puppet who expresses concern in a British accent. Now the animal screams at Mel's character in Gibson's own deranged voice spliced in from angry phone calls to ex-lover Oksana Grigorieva. \"You should just smile and blow me,\" and \"You look like a b**** in heat!\" the puppet shouts obscenely as Gibson looks baleful in his actorly best. Different videos are choosing different quotes to stuff in the beaver's mouth. The stunt was picked up by Jimmy Kimmel on Jimmy Kimmel Live this week. There's been no word so far from Mel or his pal and co-star, film producer/director Jodie Foster.",
