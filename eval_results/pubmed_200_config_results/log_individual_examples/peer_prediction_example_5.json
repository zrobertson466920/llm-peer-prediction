although there was no significant difference between those with severe asthma and those with non - severe asthma in terms of the prevalence of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies ( 81.4% vs. 69.2% ) , mean levels were higher in the former than in the latter ( 1.65  3.25 ku / l vs. 0.54  0.72 ku / l ) . \n  in another study ( n = 210 ) , the same authors obtained similar results , the prevalence of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies being 76.1% in patients with severe asthma and 71.1% in those with non - severe asthma , mean levels being three times higher in the former than in the latter . \n bachert et al . found a significant increase in staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with severe asthma when compared with those with mild asthma and controls ( n = 70 ) . \n  in a more recent study ( n = 387 ) , the same group of authors found a significant increase in staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies in patients with severe uncontrolled asthma ( 59.6% ) when compared with those with controlled asthma ( 40.8% ) and controls ( 13.0% ) . \n high levels of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies have been found to be a risk factor for asthma ( or = 7.6 ) and severe asthma ( or = 11.09 ) . \n\n  in latin \n america , there have been no studies correlating staphylococcal superantigens with the severity of asthma . \n therefore , we investigated a population of asthma patients treated at a university hospital in the city of rio de janeiro , brazil , and having no risk factors for increased staphylococcal colonization or infection in order to correlate the clinical severity of asthma with the presence of staphylococcal toxin - specific ige antibodies and degree of ige - mediated sensitization . \n this was a cross - sectional study including adult patients clinically and functionally diagnosed with asthma and receiving outpatient treatment at the clementino fraga filho university hospital , located in the city of rio de janeiro , brazil . between 2009 and 2013 , \n consecutive patients were divided into two groups according to the clinical severity of asthma based on the global initiative for asthma criteria \n\n\n : the mild asthma ( ma ) group , comprising patients with mild intermittent or persistent asthma ; and the moderate or severe asthma ( msa ) group .   according to the global initiative for asthma \n , \n\n\n  asthma severity can be evaluated on the basis of the treatment required in order to control the disease . \n patients with mild asthma are defined as those requiring only rescue medication , low - dose inhaled corticosteroids / leukotriene receptor antagonists , or a combination of the two . \n patients with moderate asthma are defined as those using long - acting 2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids at low or moderate doses . \n patients with severe asthma are defined as those using long - acting 2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids at high doses or other bronchodilators and anti - inflammatory drugs for asthma control . \n the criteria for inclusion in the present study were as follows : being an adult patient clinically and functionally diagnosed with asthma , \n\n\n  regardless of the presence of rhinitis and positive skin test results to aeroallergens . \n the exclusion criteria were as follows : presence of copd , atopic dermatitis , or both ;
