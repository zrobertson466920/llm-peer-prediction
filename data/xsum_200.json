Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\n\"You're put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it's difficult, it's difficult to get away from it. It's like every man for himself, there's nothing.\"\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you've got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues.

I don't delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can't.\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.",

The latest findings help to explain why.\nHowever, Dr Longo said people should not rush off and crash diet.\nHe told the BBC: \"It boils down to do not try this at home, this is so much more sophisticated than people realise.\"\nHe said people could \"get into trouble\" with their health if it was done without medical guidance.\nDr Emily Burns, research communications manager at Diabetes UK, said: \"This is potentially very exciting news, but we need to see if the results hold true in humans before we'll know more about what it means for people with diabetes.\n\"People with type-1 and type-2 diabetes would benefit immensely from treatments that can repair or regenerate insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.\"\nFollow James on Twitter.",

France's Essilor is the world's number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy's Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\n\"The parties' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician's shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\nBut if you have been inside an optician's shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people's noses.\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (\u00c2\u00a312.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\nThese are:\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.\nWill customers benefit as well?",

I don't think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.\n\"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.\n\"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.\n\"Medals at any cost, that's how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\"\nHouvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.\n\"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn't seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.\n\"They didn't care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.\n\"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don't feel was right.\"\nFourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.\nAsked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It's a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.\n\"It's not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.\n\"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they'll be dealt with.\"",

But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (\u00c2\u00a313,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn't making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\nMr Badr says it's still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\n\"That's basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\n\"It's not just entertaining them, it's also informing them,\" he says. \"There's a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that's on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\nBut clubs don't only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night's takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\n\"It's an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there's the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you're contracted at.\n\"If it's somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who's had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\n\"And if you're just a knock out comic, then you're coming in and getting a door deal. You're taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\n\"It's become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they'll book him almost sight unseen. That's it.\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\nHe says: \"We all thought 'who's going to come to a comedy club? The dream's over, I've got to get a real job now'.\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"",

BT's retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about \u00c2\u00a340bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about \u00c2\u00a310bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.\nSenior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT's rivals would like to see spun off.\nSeparating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\nCreating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\nBT's share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company's owners.\nThis holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.\nIt also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.\nBT's chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.\nIf they prove too much at odds with BT's own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.",

Prof Robert Paterson, from the University of Texas, Austin, says that he learned this the hard way under the administration of George W Bush, another president cool on climate.\n\"Within a month of coming into office the EPA website went down for three weeks and when it went back up stuff wasn't available anymore,\" Prof Paterson told BBC News.\n\"If history repeats itself with another administration that is basically a naysayer to climate change science, I would say it would be prudent for folks to do what they can to keep as much as they can on mirror sites.\"\nOther scientists are concerned about nominations to key government areas such as former Texas governor Rick Perry at Department of Energy (DoE) and Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt at the EPA. Both have heavily criticised the agencies they now lead.\nAttempts by the Trump transition team at the DoE to obtain a list of all those employees who had worked on climate change have provoked anger as well as fear.\n\"I was horrified by the report with regard to Department of Energy scientists being named.  We must stand up to that and I have said so. We are all DoE scientists in that regard,\" said Dr Kevin Trenberth who has been a lead author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is a senior scientist at the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).\n\"That is a pretty chilling action by an incoming administration - the rhetoric suggests that revenge is a valid response to people who disagree with you,\" said Prof Robert Paterson,\nThe Energy department has refused to comply with the request and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was \"not authorised\".\nMany researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations.\n\"Flooding is a fact of life in Texas and the frequency with which we're seeing it is noticeably increasing,\" said Dr Shannon Van Zandt, at Texas A&M University.\n\"A lot of the tools that have been developed by Federal agencies have been designed to help communities predict the changes that they're going to see and if that is restricted we would lose the ability to help people understand and incorporate it into the decisions that they're making both at the local level and at the state policy level.\"\nBut some in this field believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking.\nMarcel Crok is a Dutch science writer who doesn't support the scientific consensus on climate change. He says that much of the research in the field takes place in an echo chamber and he welcomes the fact that the Trump administration will challenge this.\nMr Crok accepts that human emissions of carbon dioxide are warming the planet, but he questions the accepted view on how far and how rapidly temperatures will rise. Mainstream scientists, he says, rely on models that are over sensitive to carbon. He expects this to change under Trump.\nHe said: \"What the field is trying to do is prove that the observational estimates are wrong and that the models are still right, and in my opinion this is exactly the problem. They should be more open minded, they should be open to the idea that the models are wrong!\"\n\"I hope that under a Trump regime at least there would be more funding, because if the funding agencies ask these kind of questions they can stimulate research in other directions than proving that the models are right all the time.\"\nThe idea that aspects of climate research, supported by a minority, should now gain funding at the expense of the majority view, is dismissed by those in the field.\n\"It is not all spun, it is not all one side or the other,\" said Prof James White from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado.\n\"This is good unbiased information, it would be a real shame if that data is turned off.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook",

    "input": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nOf his first 30 matches in 2017, the world number one has won 21 and lost nine.\nWinning his last five tournaments of 2016 to pip Novak Djokovic to the year-end number one position in the final match of the season at London's O2 Arena was astonishing, dramatic and unforgettable.\nAnd yet it appears that relentless run of success, and the 87 matches he played over a season, has come at a price.\nMurray's straight-set defeat by world number 90 Jordan Thompson in the first round at Queen's Club was the sixth time he has lost to a player outside the top 20 this year. He has had shingles and an elbow problem, and now his left hip is proving cause for concern.\nOpting out of two scheduled exhibition matches at the Hurlingham Club in London may not be too much of a blow, as Murray's aptitude for grass is likely to allow him some margin for error during the opening week at Wimbledon. But will he be in pain, and will his movement suffer?\nAlthough it was reassuring to see him return to the practice courts on Friday, Murray was walking with a limp and neither moving, nor hitting his backhand, anywhere near as well as he will need to. Only time will tell.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nMurray has looked especially vulnerable this season over three sets.\nAs well as the defeat by Thompson at Queen's, he has also lost in straight sets to Fabio Fognini in Rome (no disgrace), to Borna Coric in Madrid, and to world number 129 Vasek Pospisil at Indian Wells.\nThough he was bamboozled by Mischa Zverev in the fourth round of the Australian Open, his Grand Slam record remains formidable. He is aiming this fortnight for a 10th consecutive Wimbledon quarter-final, and the last time he failed to reach the second week of a Slam was when he fell to Stan Wawrinka in the third round of the 2010 US Open.\nSo, assuming Murray's hip does not leave him underpowered, the French Open provides the best indication as to how he might fare at Wimbledon.\nMurray often started slowly in matches at Roland Garros, but put in a dominant third-round performance against Juan Martin del Potro as he won in straight sets. He never looked a realistic champion, but ultimately was just a tie-break away from a second consecutive final. He then ran out of steam, a legacy of insufficient matches, in a Stan Wawrinka-dominated final set of their semi-final.\nIt would be foolish to try to come to a firm conclusion about Murray's chances at the All England Club this year. Twice a champion, and a gold-medal winner on Centre Court at the 2012 Olympics, not even Novak Djokovic has outperformed him at Wimbledon over the past five years.\nYet on 2017 results alone, Murray is only the seventh best player in the field.\nHe has too frequently struggled to impose himself on his opponent, and hindered at times by injury, has not been able to trust his serve in the same way.\nThis year he has won 72% of points on first serve, down from 76% last year; and while last year he saved 66% of the break points he faced, that number has fallen this year to 54%.\nHe claims his indifferent form is nothing to do with the pressure associated with his status as world number one, and he does not cut the figure of a man weighed down by an unwelcome burden.\nBut perhaps Murray has lost his cause: he is now the hunted, rather than the hunter.\nThat may not be a concern much longer.\nMurray is virtually 5,000 points behind Rafael Nadal in the season-long race and is therefore very likely to be replaced at the top of the rankings by the autumn at the latest.\nIn fact, he could be overtaken after Wimbledon by Wawrinka or Djokovic if they win the title, but more probably by Nadal, who assuming both reach the second week would only have to go one round further.\nNadal's knees, Djokovic's blues and Wawrinka's unexceptional Wimbledon record muddy the waters still further.\nAnd then there's Roger Federer: the seven-time champion, who is free of injuries, and last Sunday in Halle won his fourth title of the year having skipped the clay-court season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device",

    "input": "But the latest Cinderella is bucking the trend - and seemingly appealing to audiences as a result.\nDirected by Sir Kenneth Branagh, Cinderella is a live-action version of Disney's classic 1950 animation that has taken $70m (\u00c2\u00a343.1m) on its opening weekend in the United States.\nYet this adaptation is completely faithful to the traditional story - including wicked stepmother, fairy godmother, glass slipper, handsome prince and happy ending.\nBritish actress Lily James, best known as Lady Rose from ITV's Downton Abbey, stars as Cinderella. Cate Blanchett plays the stepmother and Helena Bonham Carter is the fairy godmother.\n\"Keeping it classic is the twist,\" says Branagh, who started his directing career in 1989 with his adaptation of Shakespeare's Henry V.\n\"I always felt that it's better to do a modern version of a story using the historical perspective, than say, make a story of Cinderella in Brooklyn in 2015.\n\"I find that when you try and update Shakespeare to a contemporary setting too, you always pay a price.\n\"In this case, the original material of Cinderella is far richer than my ideas, so it seems to me that it's my job to make it simple. Just let the fairytale speak, because it affects us in a more complicated way than we think.\n\"Audiences have already come up to me saying the film is about patchwork families, about child bereavement, about the politics between women these days. Fairytales are a psychological brain-worm that need to be left alone to do their work.\"\nHelena Bonham Carter says that at first she was dubious \"as to whether a straight version would work\".\n\"I think it's a really good film, but it could so easily have been bad. I was saying: 'So you're really going to do a completely straight version of Cinderella? No gimmicks, no extra frills, no 3D?'\n\"It's very classic, but they know me, and they allowed me not to be that straight in my own role.\"\nJust as audiences seem to have taken to the film, critics such as the Guardian's Guy Lodge comment that \"while it might have been nice to see the new-model Cinderella follow Frozen's progressive, quasi-feminist lead, the film's naff, preserved-in-amber romanticism is its very charm\".\nBut James disagrees that this Cinderella is an old-fashioned heroine, pointing out that at the start of Disney's 1950 classic, Cinderella \"is staring out of the window dreaming of the prince and waiting for him to rescue her\".\n\"This Cinderella doesn't do that at all. I think we make it very clear that everything she does is her choice - even deciding to stay on at her parents' house with such wicked treatment from her stepmother.\n\"She is told by her dying mother to 'have courage and be kind' and this is the film's, and Cinderella's, backbone.\"\nThis is the first major leading role for Surrey-born James. \"Not even a big TV series like Downton could prepare me for this fuss,\" she says.\n\"I am getting slightly carried away. I keep seeing giant posters of me all over the place in a big blue dress and people shouting my name.\n\"I'm trying to enjoy the magic actually - this is the fairytale aspect of it for me, personally. It's quite something that so many little girls are going to think I'm Cinderella.\"\nJames has dismissed speculation that her waist had been digitally altered to make it smaller as \"irrelevant\", claiming that fans were interested in Cinderella because of her \"morals\".\nCate Blanchett agrees that the core of the film is \"kindness\", adding that it is \"an unusual quality these days. There's not a cynical bone in this film's body and that's its strength.\n\"There is cruelty and jealousy in the movie too, but too often we don't value kindness. In today's world you think someone who is kind is a doormat, and the fact this triumphs is really heart-warming.\"\nBranagh, who previously directed Marvel's Thor, describes kindness \"as its own super-power. It is a dark world and children do need to understand they need courage and resilience to get through it.\n\"People often compare the story of Shakespeare's King Lear in relation to Cinderella. There is a resemblance there - a father making a tragic error and three daughters; great cruelty and great kindness.\n\"This film is all about the difficult but simple choice to be good and kind. Whether you're dealing with Shakespeare or the great fairy stories, they are all great big metaphors for human nature.\n\"And regardless of what happens to this film version, I believe this is why the tale of Cinderella will keep enduring.\"\nCinderella is out in the UK on 27 March.",

Of course. Did Russia know that Julia Samoilova would fall foul of this law? Of course. In other words, entering her in the contest was a conscious provocation to create a huge political scandal.\"\nThe ban created a huge headache for Eurovision organisers, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).\nEurovision's Executive Supervisor Jon Ola Sand said in March that Ukraine's decision went \"against both the spirit of the contest and the notion of inclusivity that lies at the heart of its values\".\nIn an unprecedented move, the EBU offered Russia the chance to take part by satellite from Moscow.\nRussia declined: after the dramas of last year's Eurovision, Moscow was in no mood to compromise.\nUkraine's 2016 winning entry, 1944, sung by Jamala, was about Joseph Stalin's deportation of Crimea's Tatar population.\nRussia had argued that Jamala's song broke contest rules for being of a political nature.

Now Russia seems determined to make not only Ukraine look bad, but the entire Eurovision Song Contest.\nWhen strangers are coming, they come to your house, they kill you and say 'we're not guilty'\nRecently, two Russian pranksters - posing as Ukraine's prime minister and his assistant - released online a telephone conversation they had recorded with a woman they claimed was EBU Director General Ingrid Deltenre.\nIf this is the voice of the EBU's top official, it is hugely embarrassing for the EBU, because the woman on the recording makes an astonishing admission about Ukraine's winning song: \"I was just too late made aware of the song.\n\"If I would have been earlier, and I think it was on purpose, I would have not allowed the song to participate, to be very transparent.\"\nIn a statement, the EBU said it would \"not comment on prank calls\".\nBut these are high-profile Russian pranksters, who once fooled Elton John into thinking he was talking to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\"Now our people don't trust Eurovision any more,\" one of the pranksters, Alexei, told me. \"People understand that any country can use their political goals to win, so it's not a fair contest anymore.\"\nPerhaps this is not just about a song contest? Or Russia's relations with Ukraine?\nEquating Eurovision with Sodom and Gomorrah and embarrassing the EBU appear part of a wider pattern of Russia trying to undermine Western institutions and Western liberal ideas.\n\"Russia now defines itself in its social and societal model against the West,\" believes Jan Techau of the Richard Holbrooke Forum at the American Academy in Berlin. \"The Kremlin explicitly portrays Russian society as a counter model to the corrupted West. They seem now to buy completely into the idea that whatever harms the West is good for Russia: a classic zero-sum game.\"\nIn the run-up to this year's contest, singer Jamala warned that \"we should expect more provocations [from Russia] because our victory hurt them a lot.\"\nSecurity in Kiev is tight ahead of the first semi-final.\nAs for Julia Samoilova, instead of singing at Eurovision this week, she will be performing - once again - in Crimea. Another political message from Moscow, to Kiev and to Europe.",

The public went down one flight of stone stairs and then there were three long arches.\n\"At the end of one of the long arches was a little tiny stage. That's where the Beatles performed 292 times.\n\"I remember it being very highly charged with excitement. The music sounded even more exciting [than the previous gigs] because The Cavern was this little squashed space so the music sounded a bit louder, a bit more exciting and a bit more vital. About 20 to 30 people were there.\n\"The Beatles were the complete package - they didn't just have a great singer, they had two great singers. They always did harmonies right from the very first time I saw them.\n\"They could probably only afford two microphones, and so when one was doing the lead singing the other two were facing each other on the mic, and it was quite charismatic, it was nice to look at. They had a camaraderie about them.\n\"I never heard them singing one of their own songs because they were just a straight covers band at that time, as was everybody else in Liverpool.\n\"The standard songs that they sang - them and the other bands in Liverpool - were [by] Chuck Berry, Little Richard, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly. The sound that I very clearly remember the Beatles playing in the Cavern was a Chuck Berry riff.\n\"As well as doing the stock standards, the Beatles were a bit different because they were better at playing complicated chords. The Beatles were a bit more adventurous.\n\"It wasn't just the music and the singing, it was their lack of respect for the audience. At the Cavern for those first few gigs, they were quite irreverent to the audience and other people. They were sort of the first punk band. The Beatles were a law unto themselves on the stage.\n\"They were still doing that when they went to America - if someone asked them a question they didn't give a serious answer, and that's how they behaved on stage in the Cavern, and that's why I think they liked it in the Cavern.\n\"They were the epitome of rebellion in Liverpool because they weren't trying to imitate Cliff Richard and the Shadows doing little in time steps. They would dance out of step on purpose.\n\"That was their purpose in life - to upset the apple cart. They were so cheeky and so entertaining all around. They were a little bit of a voice for us against authority. I think they were rebels. We were mini rebels supporting them.\n\"Of course when I went back to work I used to stand gazing out of the window thinking about the Beatles and the girls at the Cavern. I couldn't really concentrate on doing any work.\n\"Just in a few weeks they'd gained a bigger following. When word went around, the crowd grew and people kept coming back. Once you'd seen them, not many people didn't go to see them again.\n\"They had big long queues, right down the length of the street and even round the corner at the bottom. But at that stage I'd dumped them.\n\"They started talking about going to London and making records and things like that. Betrayal.\n\"I wasn't the only one. I think the ones who thought that they'd discovered them were a little clique and really did give up on them when the masses found them. It was only when I heard Love Me Do on the radio that I started getting interested in them again. My wife subsequently bought all the LPs but that first era of The Beatles was over for me.\"\nAlex McKechnie was speaking to BBC News entertainment reporter Ian Youngs.\nThe Cavern is celebrating the anniversary with a series of tribute events on Wednesday. A documentary about the first gig will be broadcast on ITV1 at 2240 GMT on Wednesday.",

    "input": "Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region.\nFor many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration.\nMr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame.\nA mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught.\nTo use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over.\nBut he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore.\nThe diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma.\nSince 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism.\nDomestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime.\nHe was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship.\nHis message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised \"lowlanders\" in Oromia and Ogadenia.\nHis concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order.\nMeasured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring.\nThe much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele.\nBut it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty.\nThe democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed \"work in progress\", has long stalled.\nSince the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents.\nWhy West will miss Meles\nObituary: Meles Zenawi\nLife in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi\nA plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time.\nFeeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival.\nHe orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents.\nHis death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising.\nThat said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus.\nThe opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up.\nMr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically.\nHe is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums.\nHe did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable.\nNot in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse.\nFrom the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought.\nMany embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called \"new breed\" of African leaders.\nThe Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests.\nHe swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to \"tame\" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991.\nThe two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea.\nHostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border.\nIt is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension.\nThat would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond.\nIn Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia.\nThe death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia.\nThere are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview.\nSuch fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility.\nHowever, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.",

There are no fees for Scottish students in Scotland and the Institute for Fiscal Studies says scrapping the lower fees charged in Northern Ireland and Wales would cost a further \u00a3500m per year.\nThis would be covered by the \u00a348.6bn that Labour's manifesto says will be raised by tax changes - along with the party's other spending commitments.\nBut there are lower estimates.\nLabour's figure is based on replacing the fees currently paid by students.\nBut the IFS and London Economics say the cost to the Treasury could be lower, when written off loans are taken into account, with forecasts around \u00a37.5bn to \u00a38bn.\nLabour's big move on fees represents a complete of direction. Previously in government, Labour raised fees and in opposition proposed a modest reduction.\nBut they are now proposing to bulldoze the apparatus of fees, loans and repayments.\nThe most recent figures show \u00a376bn is owed in student loans in England - with this level of student debt having almost doubled in four years.\nFrom this autumn, fees will begin increasing every year with inflation and will soon glide past the \u00a310,000 mark, with interest charges also rising to 6.1%.\nAnd the Conservative government, before the election, had announced plans to sell off student debt to private investors.\nUnder Labour's plans, this whole push towards marketisation would be ditched - and universities would return to being directly funded by government.\nBut is there any evidence that getting rid of fees would help more young people into university, including the disadvantaged?\nUniversities are worried that such a switch to direct funding, dependent on government finances, would put a limit on places and a brake on expansion.\nOne of the quiet revolutions of recent years has been the complete removal of limits on student numbers - with universities able to recruit as many students as they can accommodate - and opening the door to rising numbers of graduates.\nThe argument for fees has always been that they provide the funding to allow more young people to go to university - and that a much smaller proportion went to university when there were no fees.\nThis year has seen a fall of 5% in university applications from UK students - and it follows a pattern of dips when fees are increased.\nBut the long-term trend has been relentlessly upwards, with a huge growth in demand for university places. It remains a powerful symbol of family aspiration.\nAlthough wealthy families remain much more likely to send their children to university - entry rates have risen across all social classes, including the poorest.\nDo students get value for money from tuition fees? Is this an investment that is repaid in better job prospects?\nDepartment for Education figures published last month showed that graduates remained more likely to be in a job than non-graduates and on average earned \u00a310,000 per year more.\nAmong younger people, this graduate advantage is less, at \u00a36,000 per year.\nBut the figures also showed that, despite rises in fees, graduate salaries have stagnated over the past decade.\nLabour's plan sends a strong political signal to young voters.\nA survey from the Higher Education Policy Institute, taken before the manifesto publication, suggested that Labour is now more popular among students than it was in any of the three previous general elections.\nThe survey found Labour significantly ahead in the student vote.\nThe Liberal Democrats, once the most popular party for students, are trailing in third behind the Conservatives.\nIs this still the cloud of tuition fees hanging over the Lib Dems from their U-turn during the coalition government?\nCould they really entirely scrap fees?\nThere will be plenty of scrutiny over funding Labour's plans. But there is nothing unprecedented or outlandish about getting rid of fees.\nGermany has phased out tuition fees - and universities in the Netherlands and Scandinavia try to recruit students from England with the offer of low or no fees.\nFrench undergraduates can study for low fees.\nIn the United States, New York state is introducing free fees for students from families earning up to about \u00a3100,000 per year, offering a handout to the squeezed middle classes.\nThere are now leading universities in the US which have lower tuition fees than in England. The University of Washington charges less than the University of Wolverhampton.\nAnd the most immediate example of getting rid of fees has been in Scotland.\nFor England's voters, Labour's undiluted policy on tuition fees - proposing their complete abolition - offers the sharpest divide in the road for decades.",

Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation, it seems, has the spooks spooked.\nThat may come as a relief to a White House that has been buffeted by a seemingly never-ending stream of controversial revelations, from allegations that the president attempted to influence the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn to reports of internal divisions within the administration.\nThe president and his aides shouldn't breath easy, however. Although today's testimony was largely a dud, Mr Comey - no longer a government employee, thanks to Mr Trump - will have more leeway to discuss his interactions with the president if he so chooses.\nHis former colleagues my have seen discretion as the better part of valour, but the former director isn't known for backing down from a fight.\nMr Coats testimony comes a day after the Washington Post reported that he told associates Mr Trump had tried to persuade the FBI to back off their investigation into his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and his ties to the Kremlin.\nUS intelligence agencies believe Russia interfered in the US election and they are investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Moscow.\nBut there is no known evidence of collusion and President Donald Trump has dismissed the story as \"fake news\".\nThe two intelligence chiefs joined acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to testify before the panel on Wednesday.\nThe lack of answers appeared to frustrate both Democratic and Republican senators, who repeatedly pressed the intelligence officials on the Russia inquiry.\nRepublican Senator Richard Burr, who chairs the committee, ended the hearing by appearing to rebuke the intelligence officials for their testimony.\n\"At no time should you be in a position where you come to Congress without an answer,\" he said.\nThe following day will see the much-anticipated testimony of Mr Comey, who was leading one of the Russia investigations before Mr Trump fired him.\nHe will be quizzed on his interactions with the president before he was sacked.\nMr Comey reportedly told Attorney General Jeff Sessions that he did not want to be left alone with the president.\nThe conversation occurred the day after the president asked Mr Comey to end the investigation into Mr Flynn during a private dinner, according to the New York Times.\nMr Comey believed the attorney general should protect the FBI from White House influence, officials told the paper.",

    "input": "As part of our fight against this, we have a very much underutilised tool - food.\nIn BBC One's Doctor in the House, I try to help 34-year-old Emma Gleeson, who has been experiencing anxiety, depression and panic attacks for many years.\nShe was 19 when she really began struggling with mental health.\nFollowing a severe episode of pneumonia, she ended up in intensive care in a coma.\nWhen she woke up she was petrified. She developed an extreme fear of death, and this can precipitate her panic attacks.\nDuring an attack, Emma feels terrified, and can often scream out loud.\nIt is extremely worrying for her family and can be scary to onlookers.\nEmma has tried various medications and counselling therapies but was still struggling and getting three to four panic attacks per day.\nOne of the ways in which I helped her was by changing her food choices.\nDespite being sceptical at first, I was able to show Emma the hidden power of food in helping her mental state.\n\"I had been living on a diet of takeaways, fizzy drinks and general processed and convenience foods for as long as I can remember, and didn't for one moment think that what I ate was contributing in any way to the anxiety and panic attacks I'd been experiencing for years,\" she said.\n\"Since meeting and spending time with Dr Rangan, he has changed my entire outlook on food, and why certain foods were potentially having a negative impact on my mental health.\n\"I now only buy and cook with fresh food, I make my own stocks, I eat plenty of fish and I try to reduce the amount of sugar I consume.\n\"I feel so much better and intend to keep this up.\"\nThe evidence of food's link to mental states has been growing.\nA landmark 2015 article in the prestigious Lancet journal stated that nutrition may be as important to mental health as it is to cardiology, endocrinology and gastroenterology.\nPlus, a small but important interventional Australian study from earlier this year showed that a modified Mediterranean diet significantly helped many patients with severe depression within 12 weeks.\nUnfortunately, this has not translated into routine patient care and most doctors still do not discuss food with their mental health patients.\nThis has to change.\nMany of us do not think about how food can impact the way we feel, but we all know the feeling of using food as a quick pick-me-up.\nWhen we are feeling a little tired, a little stressed or a little low, we often reach for a sugary snack to help us feel good in the short term.\nBut, this can actually make things worse in the long term.\nThe food you are eating is literally \"shocking\" your body.\nBy changing her diet, as well as reducing her alcohol intake, Emma experienced a reduction in anxiety, an improvement in mood and fewer panic attacks.\nShe also described feeling mentally stronger, having a clearer head, more energy and a greater ability to cope with stress.\nIt has also encouraged her to be more active and do more things at weekends, which also helps her mental health.\nOf course, there can be many other factors to consider with mental health problems and it is always worth getting advice from a qualified healthcare professional.\nThere can be many other important factors to consider with mental health problems, such as emotional trauma and stress, but we should not underestimate the power of changing our food to improve our mood.\nAs a doctor, I like to empower my patients. Here are four of the tips that helped Emma, that can also help you:\n1. Reduce sugar and processed foods\nSugar, food that contains sugar, or even food that is converted quickly into sugar, such as many breakfast cereals, cause your blood sugar to rapidly rise.\nWithin two to three hours your sugar levels then start to fall.\nAt this point, you may not only feel hungry, you can feel \"h-angry\" as well - hungry and angry.\nLow and falling blood sugar levels can cause a rise in your body's stress hormones, cortisol and adrenaline.\nThis can have a negative impact on your mood.\n2. Increase your intake of Omega-3 fats\nThis is an essential nutrient for brain function and may protect against anxiety and other psychiatric disorders.\nFoods high in Omega-3 fats include fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, anchovies), grass-fed meat, seeds and leafy vegetables.\n3. Eat more tryptophan-containing foods like pork, chicken, seeds and walnuts\nTryptophan is an amino acid the body converts into serotonin, your feel-good neurotransmitter.\nEat them with a healthy carbohydrate source such as sweet potatoes, which helps to transport more tryptophan into your blood.\n4. Feed your gut bugs\nSome scientists refer to the trillions of gut bugs that live inside us, the gut microbiota, as the brain's peacekeepers.\nIt is thought that having a healthy population of gut bugs can have a significant influence on your mood via the gut-brain axis.\nThe prebiotic fibre contained in vegetables help your gut bugs to proliferate, so the best way to maintain a healthy population is to increase your intake of vegetables, as well as fermented foods such as sauerkraut.\nBest options are leeks, onions, garlic, artichokes and cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower.\nYou have the ability to improve the way you feel by controlling what you put on your plate.\nSee how food can impact mental health on Doctor in the House, Monday, 21:00 BST on BBC One.",

Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day.\n\"I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,\" she admits.\n\"I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up.\n\"Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.\"\nWe arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive.\nLaura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's \"glad you only find out on the day\".\n\"I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers.\n\"I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.\"\nBackstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn.\n\"There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,\" says Laura.\n\"With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress.\n\"My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.\"\nStill in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal.

I mean what the hell is that about?\" she laughs.\n\"Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.\"\nTime for some nourishment. The team (\"there's like millions of them... making it work\") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in.\n\"I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.\"\n\"[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,\" says Laura. \"He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight.\n\"I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'.\n\"It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.\"\nMinutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands.\nShe's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved.\nWith the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman.\n\"If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound.

I use his camera to push myself back up and\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 BLAM!

Even if they were fined for over-running by 40 seconds.\nColdplay were the headline act at last year's Super Bowl in Santa Clara - but someone forgot to tell Beyonce.\nShe only performed one song, Formation, underscoring its message of black pride and power with back-up dancers dressed in leather body suits and black berets reminiscent of the Black Panthers movement.\nSome of her dancers were even pictured holding up a sign declaring \"Justice 4 Mario Woods\" - a 26-year-old black man who was shot dead by armed police in San Francisco two months earlier.\nThe performance heralded the arrival of her unapologetically political album, Lemonade, later in the year.\nYou can't out-diva Diana, something she was determined to prove when she strode onto the pitch in Tempe, Arizona, for Super Bowl XXX.\nShe raced through 10 songs and four costume changes in 12 minutes, then jumped into a helicopter and fled the stadium. Which is one way to beat the post-game traffic.\nFor the first few decades, the Super Bowl half-time performance featured marching bands, drill teams and Disney's mouseketeers.\n1987's show was altogether more bizarre.\nA magician named \"Elvis Presto\" burst out of a jukebox, before performing a series of conjuring tricks, aided by 2,000 part-time dancers, 102 custom Harley Davidson motorcycles and some of rock's biggest classics.\nAt the culmination of the show, the \"Prince of Prestidigitation\" performed an interactive magic trick (\"pick a card, concentrate real hard\") while viewers at home watched through 3D glasses.\nIt was cheesier than a wheel of brie - and prompted the NFL to adopt a more modern approach.\nShe arrived on a mechanical tiger, and departed on a shooting star - but Katy Perry couldn't compete with the infamous \"left shark\".\nHe was one of two foam-suited dancers flanking Katy while she performed Teenage Dream. While the one on the right was forgettable, the left shark flailed around in a desperate attempt to remember his dance moves.\nIt quickly became a viral sensation, spawning a whole range of merchandise from the ever-savvy pop star.\nAnd when the half-time show was nominated for an Emmy, Katy made sure to thank her faithful friend.\nPoor old Janet Jackson. She was at the end of a triumphant, hit-laden medley when Justin Timberlake ripped the front off her bodice, revealing a heavily-bejewelled superboob.\nFew ever believed that the \"wardrobe malfunction\" was indeed a malfunction - but if you look at the photographs taken immediately after the event, Jackson appears mortified (notably, these were not the pictures printed by the press).\nNonetheless, America went apoplectic. The Federal Complaints Commission reportedly got more than 200,000 complaints, while Janet was blacklisted by MTV and radio. Her career never fully recovered.\nBut there is a bright side to this story. A PayPal employee called Jawed Karim missed the half-time show and grew frustrated that he couldn't watch the incident online.\nIn response, he and his friends Steve Chen and Chad Hurley began coding a website where people could upload their own content.

    "input": "A Leave vote was always seen as more likely to generate significant disturbances in the financial world.\nFor that reason it is also the result which was thought more likely to pose a headache for the world's central banks.\nThere have already been statements from some that they are prepared to act to maintain financial stability.\nThere are two potential issues they might want to respond to in the short term: the stability of the (commercial) banks and swings in exchange rates.\nWith the banks there is a possibility of a general rise in risk aversion, and some might have difficulty borrowing in the inter-bank market. The ultimate danger from that is that they might be unable to make debt payments as they come due.\nCentral banks can address that by lending them extra money (liquidity). In the UK the Bank of England has already been doing this ahead of the referendum, hoping to ensure that there is sufficient liquidity already in place. The Bank has said it \"will continue to monitor market conditions carefully and keep its operations under review\".\nOther central banks will be ready to take similar action if they think it's needed.\nWhat if the strains show up in terms of foreign currency liquidity - say an Italian bank needing quick access to Swiss francs?\nThere are arrangements known as swap lines put in place during the international financial crisis that can be used if necessary. The Italian bank could then get Swiss francs from the European Central Bank (ECB), (and the Swiss National Bank would be able to offer euros to Swiss banks if needed). The Bank of England is involved in these arrangements so it can get foreign currency if British banks were to need it urgently.\nWith sharp moves in exchange rates, there are several options. They could just live with it. But if they felt the swings were too sharp and destabilising they could intervene using their foreign currency reserves.\nIn the case of the UK, the decision to conduct such intervention is for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, with the Bank of England carrying it out in the markets.\nSo if there were too precipitous a fall in the value of one currency (sterling would be the obvious candidate in the event of a leave vote) the Bank of England could buy sterling with dollars or yen from its reserves, hoping the additional demand for the pound would support its value.\nConversely the Swiss National Bank has been worried about too rapid a rise in the Swiss franc and has already been into the markets to buy other currencies such as the euro with its own national currency.\nFurther action on these lines is a possibility. Currencies seen as havens are susceptible to unwanted sharp rises in times of financial stress and the Swiss franc is a prime example of that.\nCurrency market intervention is often not announced. Some observers say there is evidence suggesting that the Swiss central bank might have intervened over the past week.  The intervention after the vote by the SNB was announced however.\nInterest rates can also be used to curb currency moves - a cut to stop a currency rising; a rate rise to prevent a fall.\nBoth options, interest rate moves and intervention, can be co-ordinated by central banks.\nFurther quantitative easing (QE) is also a possible response to a rising currency. It tends to drive down market interest rates and there has been some speculation that it might be on the agenda very soon,  perhaps from the Bank of Japan (which does not want to see the yen gaining value).\nInterest rate moves and QE can also be used to address longer term fallout - to tackle any impact on inflation or growth. The Bank of England has scope to cut rates further and it could undertake further QE. A fall in sterling would be inflationary, though up to a point that could be welcome as inflation is currently (at 0.3%) far below the Bank's target (2%).\nAnother risk is that in a general flight from riskier assets the government debt problem in the eurozone could return, pushing up borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy that were in the firing line a few years ago.\nThose earlier eurozone storms abated after the ECB announced that it was prepared in some circumstances to buy the bonds, the debts, of governments severely affected. In the event it never used this new weapon. The mere threat of doing so was enough to settle the eurozone bond market.\nSome observers, such as the London consultancy Capital Economics, think it could finally use this programme, if the aftermath of a leave vote were sufficiently disruptive.\nThe likely timescale for these options varies.  In principle many could be done very quickly. The most urgent, if needed, would probably be bank liquidity. Interest rates and QE could be announced early, but could also be used as a response to economic fallout that might emerge over a longer period.\nThe ECB's option of riding to the rescue of the likes of Spain or Italy would take some time. They would need to have an economic policy programme agreed with the rest of the eurozone. And Spain in particular, with an election this weekend, is itself in a period of political uncertainty that could make it difficult to conduct international negotiations.",

After winning possession, Naismith ran into the area to receive a Baines pass before stabbing a shot at goal. Rodriguez tried to clear, but the ball cannoned off goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, and hit the Wolfsburg full-back again before ending up in his own net.\nThat was Everton's first goal in Europe at Goodison Park since beating Sporting Lisbon 2-1 in February 2010, and it had the buoyant home crowd hungry for more.\nEverton duly attempted to deliver, with full-backs Baines and Coleman becoming more adventurous as Wolfsburg offered little going forward, and their attacking instincts resulted in the home side's second goal on the stroke of half-time.\nMirallas's drive was weakly pushed into the path of Baines, who had followed the shot into the area, and he knocked the ball across goal for Coleman to nod in.\nWolfsburg boss Dieter Hecking introduced Germany midfielder Aaron Hunt for the start of the second half, but within seconds of the restart Everton went further ahead. This time, Robin Knoche's foul on McGeady was deemed to have occurred inside the area, and Baines confidently despatched the resulting penalty.\nThe goal effectively ended Wolfsburg's hopes of returning to Germany with anything to show but, with nothing to lose, they embarked on a spell of dominance.\nFor a good 30 minutes they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and attempts on goal, as Tim Howard produced saves from Luiz Gustavo's opportunistic shot and Rodriguez's well-struck free-kick.\nFormer Arsenal striker Nicklas Bendtner was introduced after the hour, with Wolfsburg boss Hecking sensing a possible goal, but instead it was Everton who grabbed a fourth. Mirallas peeled away from defenders to run on to substitute Samuel Eto'o's through ball and he coolly slotted in at Benaglio's near post.\nThere was still time for Wolfsburg to get the consolation their 27 shots on goal deserved, Rodriguez making some amends for his early own goal with a curling free-kick.\nEverton boss Roberto Martinez: \"The atmosphere was perfect for us to start a very good performance.\n\"I thought there were two very good sides.

    "input": "According to Cancer Research UK some 41, 000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year, but 10,700 will die of the disease, making it the fourth most common cause of cancer death - and second only to lung cancer in men.\nGiven such a dire prognosis, and let's face it, given the financial profile of its victims, you might be forgiven for assuming that prostate cancer would be one of the most highly prioritised and well researched areas of oncology. Not a bit of it. Perhaps it's because men are squeamish, or don't like to talk about their health or visit the doctor, but prostate cancer has long been dubbed \"the Cinderella cancer\".\n\"We just don't make enough of it\" according to consultant oncologist Professor Neil Burnet. \"On the whole men are less vocal about their health, and older men tend to be even more stoical, preferring to grin and bear it. But it means men are poor advocates, and as a result prostate cancer has been overlooked\".\nBased at Addenbrooke's Hospital on the outskirts of Cambridge, Prof Burnet is trying to improve the targeting and efficiency of radiotherapy treatments, and to reduce toxicity in the healthy tissue surrounding the prostate. The technique, called Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment uses imaging provided by a CT scan to target the tumour before a powerful but precisely shaped radiation dose is administered.\n\"What limits what we can do with radiotherapy are the side effects of the treatment, the toxicity.  And, since the prostate can move by up to a couple of centimetres from one day to the next, targeting the treatment is really important. The second half of this technology is in delivering intensity modulated radiotherapy, which allows us to match a higher dose of radiation to the shape of the tumour.\"\nBut if Image Guided IMRT offers the prospect of better outcomes for men with advanced or aggressive prostate cancer, how much better might it be to get in at an earlier stage?\nThat - at least in part - was the motivation behind the Collaborative Oncological Gene/Environment Study, or COGES, which has announced the discovery of 80 new genetic markers for breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. In one of the largest research projects of its kind scientists from Cambridge University and the Institute of Cancer Research in London looked at samples from more than 200,000 people - half with, and half without, cancer.\nThe results include 23 new gene variants associated with prostate cancer and 16 with aggressive forms of the disease. Initially at least that should help with the development of a viable screening test for the disease. In the longer term it may present new targets for drug treatment and better diagnosis, and a greater understanding of the mechanisms and basic biology of prostate cancer.\n\"It's shocking, but we still don't have an adequate screening test for prostate cancer,\" says Ros Eeles, Professor of Oncogenetics at the Institute of Cancer Research and COGES study leader on prostate cancer. \"That's because the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA test, just isn't accurate enough and you'd have to treat between 12 and 48 men unnecessarily to save a single life. With this new information we could have a viable test in five to eight years\".\nIf that still seems a long way off, surgical techniques have advanced dramatically when it comes to prostate cancer. These days consultant urologist Professor David Neal uses the DaVinci surgical robot to perform prostate surgery.\nSitting at a computer console that looks like it would be more at home in an amusement arcade than an operating theatre, Prof Neal can perform a prostatectomy without ever touching his patient. And because the robotic arms of the device (which looks a little like a crab hovering over the operating table) are much thinner than the surgeon's, and the grappling and cutting tools at the sharp end are much smaller, what was once a major operation is now less invasive.\nAs with Image Guided Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue is kept to a minimum.\n\"The DaVinci robot has made a huge difference to prostate surgery\" says Prof Neal. \"It's still a major operation, but we can be very precise about what we remove and the function we're able to save. That's got to be good news for the patient\".",

Taxiways and aprons - where aircraft park - have also been sabotaged.\nAbout 50,000 Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition airstrikes, are currently involved in a military offensive to reclaim Mosul from IS militants.\nGovernment forces have already retaken dozens of villages and towns surrounding the city and are currently consolidating gains made in Mosul's eastern outskirts.\nThe damage to the runways has rendered the airport worthless as an asset for attacking forces, says Stratfor. Airports or runways are typically a primary objective for assaults on cities, since control over them can deny or enable logistical capabilities, having a considerable impact on the outcome of battles.\nHowever, IS militants have ensured there is little left for approaching forces to gain by taking the site, Stratfor says.\nIS employed a similar tactic at Qayyarah air base, 70km (43 miles) south of Mosul. However, the trenches dug there only partially covered the main runway, Stratfor says, and it was restored to service within months of the Iraqi forces recapturing the base in July.\nBy comparison, Mosul airport's destruction could be much more difficult to repair.\nMirroring the demolition at Qayyarah, IS fighters have also levelled almost every structure at Mosul airport.\nStratfor says that as well as preventing Iraqi forces and their allies from using the facilities, the tactic also serves to clear the line of sight for IS defensive positions on the northern edge of the airport.\nAlong with restoring the runways, Iraqi forces would need to rebuild hangars, warehouses and other infrastructure in order to use it as a logistical base.\nIn contrast to the widespread destruction elsewhere in the area, the images show how the city's sugar factory remains relatively intact - testimony to its utility to IS.\nAfter the jihadists captured Mosul in June 2014, they continued to operate the factory, says Stratfor, and more than a year later, executed the plant's manager when she refused to run it for them.\nHowever, the images also show how coalition airstrikes, aimed at destroying key IS positions and assets, have caused some damage to the buildings.\nSatellite imagery released last week, showed how IS had constructed multiple barricades across key routes into the northern Iraqi city.",

When asked if it is \"tens of millions\" of dollars, he replies, \"I would not like to be too specific, but I wouldn't contradict what you just said.\"\nTrained as a neuroscientist, Mr Kuhn became an investment banker and then in the early 1990s sold his mergers and acquisitions firm \"at the right time\".\nHe says he worked hard, \"but if I don't acknowledge there was a lot of luck involved I would be fooling myself\".\nHe wants to encourage more and more people to become wealthy, but also to place limits on the amount of wealth that can be passed on to the next generation.\n\"That gives each generation a chance to have higher social mobility.\"\nBut given that the gap between rich and poor has reached its widest level for 30 years in most developed countries, according to says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) group of developed nations - that social mobility is getting harder for many.\nIn the 1980s, the richest 10% had incomes seven times greater than the poorest 10% in the average industrialised country.\nNow, in those same countries, the richest have incomes nine-and-a half times greater than the poorest, on average. The actual figures vary widely across the 34 OECD's member states.\nIn Denmark the top 10% earn about five times more than the bottom 10% - in Mexico they earn 30 times as much.\nHow much more do the top 10% earn than the bottom 10%?\nSource: OECD (2011)\nOther organisations, too, are highlighting this discrepancy between rich and poor. A report this month from the charity Oxfam says the world's wealthiest 1% will own more than 50% of the world's wealth by 2016.\n\"This is something that we should be very worried about,\" says Mark Pearson, the OECD's deputy director of employment, labour and social affairs.\nIf countries want to boost their economic growth, then they need to take steps to narrow this wealth gap, says the OECD.\nThis goes against the longstanding free market argument that rising wealth at the top will trickle down to everybody else.\nBut, the OECD research suggest that the reverse is true. \"Our finding is that by reducing income inequality, you can boost economic growth,\" Mr Pearson told BBC World Service's Business Daily programme.\nAn increasing wealth gap hinders economic growth because it limits investment in a country's labour force, argues the OECD.\nPoorer people cannot afford to spend as much as the rich can on their children's education.\nAnd that lack of investment in education means a less educated and less flexible workforce in the long run, says the group in its research.\nIt is not just the super-rich that are doing well - those whose business is dealing with super-rich customers are profiting too.\nAlex Cheatle is chief executive of Ten Group, a lifestyle concierge service that can helps its clients get that exclusive restaurant table, sell-out theatre ticket - or finds that vintage sports car in a particular colour.\nTen will even do your window-shopping for you, if you are too rich or famous to be able to do it yourself.\n\"Very often they will want us to take a picture of the window and get it to them, so they do their window shopping as and when they want to,\" says Mr Cheatle.\n\"There hasn't really been a crisis for many of our members. Business is booming for us, we've grown every year since 2008 - growing at an average rate of 25-30% a year.\"\nWhen you consider how much the super-rich spend, that growth is perhaps not surprising.\nOver the course of a year, it's reckoned the world's top 1% spend a staggering $45bn (\u00a330bn) on travel and hospitality, $40bn (\u00a326bn) on cars, and $25bn (\u00a316bn) each on art, jewellery and watches.\nOr course, the ultimate statement of wealth is to have your own super-yacht - complete with helicopter pad, speedboat tenders and even a submarine or two.\nThe world's biggest such boat is currently the Azzam, 180m (590ft) long, launched in 2013 at a reported cost of up to $600m (\u00a3400m) - and the sector has certainly weathered the global slowdown better than many others.\nSource: Boat International\nSo with the wealth gap rising should the rich pay more tax, and if so would that help?\nRobert Kuhn - now business and financial commentator - argues that countries that decide to increase taxes on the rich may not see any benefit.\nHe believes increasing income taxes to too high a level would \"inhibit the creation of new wealth which is detrimental to society\".\n\"I'm just worried about the behaviour and implications if you put too high a tax rate, what that will do to current generations in their energy and focus to create new wealth,\" says Mr Kuhn.\nAt Scipio Partnership, Catherine Tillotson says that focussing on tax misses out the contributions made by many rich patrons to philanthropic and charitable causes.\n\"The tax question is hugely complicated,\" she says.\n\"Most families that I've met will say that it is absolutely critical to them that they pay the right amount of tax according to the rules.\"\nHowever, \"in many ways those dollars spent on philanthropic passions may be doing more good than they would have done in the tax system\", she says.\nYet ever since the financial crisis of 2008, and subsequent global economic slowdown, politicians have come under increasing pressure to increase tax contributions from the richest in their societies.\nProtest movements such as Occupy Wall Street, which started in 2011 and has since spread to many other countries, have highlighted concern over social and economic inequality worldwide.\nFor his part, Robert Kuhn is not convinced that a widening wealth gap matters in economic terms, but \"it matters in social stability for sure\", he agrees.\n\"It matters in terms of social mobility of subsequent generations.\"\n\"To me that's the biggest problem, for any country,\" he says. \"And many countries are facing that.\"\nClick here for more from BBC's A Richer World, a season exploring the world's wealth, poverty and inequality",

    "input": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nSince dethroning Wladimir Klitschko in Dusseldorf last November, the Briton has resembled a runaway lorry - smashing through road blocks and red lights, skittling well-meaning people frantically waving warning flags, and only slowing down to shout obscenities and honk his horn, the louder the better.\nBut that can happen when your mind is scrambled and you don't know what's what: you might be in the driver's seat but your hands aren't on the wheel, your feet are up on the dashboard and there's a brick on the accelerator pedal.\nAnother way of looking at it is that Fury's crash actually came on that fateful night in Germany and he has been spewing smoke ever since. The morning after the Englishman's stunning upset of Klitschko and his acquisition of the WBA, IBF and WBO belts, he admitted he might struggle to cope.\nBut not even those closest to him could have anticipated how true that would prove. Having beaten the various boxing authorities to the punch and relinquished the belts before being banned, stripped or both, it's anyone's guess as to when - if ever - he'll have his keys back and his engine revving again.\nFury has been speaking about his mental health struggles for years, with disarming and often alarming frankness. So his pronouncement immediately after his victory over Klitschko and the recent news that he was withdrawing from the scheduled rematch because of depression was not a shock.\nWhen I interviewed him in 2013, he described himself as \"an all-action man in anything I do. If I'm drinking, I'm drinking until I can't stand up. If I'm going out for Chinese, I'm going to an all-you-can-eat Chinese. If I'm eating cake, I'm eating the whole cake. I don't know what you'd call me. An idiot, maybe?\"\nHardly surprising, then, that having fulfilled his dream of winning the world heavyweight crown, Fury would lose focus. Most people having fallen down drunk or eaten a whole cake would steer clear of booze and Battenbergs for a while. But Fury is not most people.\nFury is not the first boxer to lose motivation having reached the pinnacle of the sport, and he certainly won't be the last. Not many people climb Everest twice.\nThe repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional\nAfter pulling off one of the greatest shocks in sporting history by beating the seemingly invincible Mike Tyson in 1990, Buster Douglas didn't train much, got fat and lost the world heavyweight crown to Evander Holyfield in his first defence. The American promptly retired, almost doubled in weight, then nearly died after falling into a diabetic coma before being struck down by depression. Same old, same old.\nJess Willard's victory over the great Jack Johnson in 1915 was almost as unbelievable as Douglas's upset of Tyson, and his reign even more shameful. Willard clearly didn't fancy fighting much, defending the world heavyweight crown once in four years before being bashed up by the great Jack Dempsey.\nSometimes depression can be triggered by a lack of motivation for the thing that defines you, sometimes that lack of motivation is triggered by depression. Either way, Fury claims he hasn't been near a gym for months and has been drinking like a fish and hoovering up cocaine instead, in a forlorn bid to mask the pain.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone magazine this month, Fury accused the British media of conducting a \"witch hunt\" against him and the British public of racism. It is important to separate the different links in Fury's sometimes rambling trains of thought.\nBefore and after his victory over Klitschko, sports writers openly discussed whether Fury should be saved from himself. Different journalists operate under different editorial guidelines, but the view of most was that they had been sent to Germany to report on a fight, not Fury's controversial outbursts.\nAs such, the repeated claims from Fury's camp that his victory was downplayed by the British media, and that they had an agenda against him from the outset, are delusional. Almost every boxing writer proclaimed Fury's performance as one of the finest ever by a British fighter, and they were right.\nBut the problem with a siege mentality is that you forget what's happening beyond the castle walls, who your real friends are, and paranoia sets in.\nWhen Fury threatened violence against a journalist and later took aim at bisexual, transsexual and Jewish people, it was internet vloggers - to whom he had granted intimate access - who provided the platform. The so-called mainstream media (newspapers and major broadcasters) had been frozen out, ironically because they had dared to report what he had told those same vloggers.\nFury's camp would do well to memorise a quote attributed to George Orwell: \"Journalism is printing what someone else does not want printing. Everything else is public relations.\" How many times has Fury been saved by journalistic self-censorship?\nIn threatening that journalist, the Mail on Sunday's Oliver Holt, for reporting that he had compared homosexuality to paedophilia, Fury betrayed his sense of entitlement - not only because of his feats in the ring, but because of his religious convictions. If it's in the Bible, how dare anyone question his beliefs?\nIf you make questionable statements about gay people or Jews or women, the media will come down on you, whether you are a fine boxer, a deeply religious man, a nice bloke really, none of the above or all of them. Fury's Traveller heritage doesn't come into it, as least as far as most of the media is concerned.\n\"I know Tyson personally and he's a really nice guy,\" says Ricky Hatton, Fury's fellow Mancunian and another boxer who has struggled with depression. \"But sometimes he puts his mouth into gear before his brain and when someone puts a camera in front of him he feels he has to say something outrageous.\"\nFury fans frequently claim that Anthony Joshua is given preferential treatment by the media, but this is because the IBF heavyweight champion - Fury was stripped of that belt shortly after winning it because he would not face the federation's mandatory challenger - largely conducts himself like a gentleman. As for Joshua's brushes with the law, they have been covered at length in the media and he has clearly learnt from them.\nHowever, some of the racial abuse Fury receives on social media is despicable.\nWhen you are called every name under the sun on a daily basis, it is likely to have an effect on your mental wellbeing. No wonder, as Fury also stated in his interview with Rolling Stone, that he feels like everyone is out to get him.\nOn Wednesday, the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) met to discuss what should be done with Fury, and has suspended his licence, pending a meeting with him. It could hardly do otherwise. It did the same to Hatton in 2010, also following allegations of cocaine use, and, as the BBBofC's general secretary Robert Smith has pointed out, \"cocaine is against the law of the land\".\nThere was also Fury's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and a subsequent ban to consider (Fury has an appeal hearing scheduled in November), as well as the allegation that he refused to take a drugs test (a misdemeanour that can lead to a four-year ban) and the argument that a man with severe mental health issues shouldn't be anywhere near a boxing ring.\nIt should also be remembered that the BBBofC has already fined Fury twice for misconduct and that it has boxing's image to think about - as mad as that sounds.\nEven if Fury hadn't voluntarily given up his belts, the WBA and WBO would have stripped him of them.\nIt might seem callous, but the sanctioning bodies are businesses, the heavyweight belts are their biggest money-spinners and it is only fair that other boxers should be allowed to fight for them. It makes no difference whether a boxer has meningitis, a broken leg or mental health issues, the sport must move on. As WBO chief Jose Izquierdo put it: \"We can't have a belt held hostage.\"\nOne can only hope that, during his absence from the ring, Fury gets the help he so desperately needs and returns fitter and more focused.\n\"Being someone who lives by the seat of his pants and for the moment, this could be the end of him,\" was Hatton's grim assessment. \"He doesn't like boxing and finds the training hard. It's not looking good.\n\"But I was in a dark place, didn't care if I lived or died. I did very well in boxing but near enough everything wrong in life. The only way I got out of it was by asking for help. I fought through it and I hope Tyson can do the same.\"\nFingers crossed that Fury will be remembered for that fine performance against Klitschko in Dusseldorf - and for many fine performances in the future - rather than as a wreck, spewing smoke on the side of the road as bright lights flash by.",

With their team absent from major tournaments for 58 years, generations in Wales have grown up to expect failure and look on longingly as others contest World Cups and European Championships.\nBut Chris Coleman's men have changed that. The beaming smiles on Welsh fans' faces before their opening match in Bordeaux spoke of a disbelief at seeing their team finally claiming their place among international football's elite.\n\"There was a psychological barrier we needed to go through for the first one, given it had been so long,\" said Coleman.\n\"We've now sampled tournament football - such an experience, such a healthy vibe from people of all nations. We want some more of that. We need some more of that.\"\nWales' players would have been forgiven for feeling as if they were living in a bubble at their training base in the idyllic Brittany coastal town of Dinard, where a small population and a gentle pace of life meant they could take a stroll on the beach and go unnoticed.\nIt is a far cry from the frenzy their success has caused back home.\nWith every victory in France, a new fan zone seemed to spring up in Wales, from Rhyl to Aberystwyth, from Swansea to Cardiff's Principality Stadium.\nHe saw us grow up. He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him\nThe messages of support were many and varied, from David Hasselhoff to the Prince of Wales, while songs by Welsh bands the Manic Street Preachers and the Super Furry Animals gave the campaign a unique soundtrack.\nDespite their serene and remote surroundings, however, the players were aware of the impression they were making.\nIn the age of social media, athletes and their followers are closer than ever, and Wales' squad members have relished that connection.\nHal Robson-Kanu's spectacular goal against Belgium made the unattached forward one of the unlikeliest stars of Euro 2016 and, speaking a couple of days later, he laughed when told about the global reaction to his goal - including a tweet from the former Nigeria and Arsenal striker Kanu.\nThere was a similar response from Joe Allen, who laughed when this reporter informed him of a fans' banner that read: \"When God made Joe Allen, he was showing off.\"\nFrom a journalist's perspective, covering this Wales side has been a privilege, given regular and revealing access to the coaches and players.\nGareth Bale, the world's most expensive footballer, was a picture of charm and affability as he conducted his media conferences and subsequent interviews before every match. The Real Madrid forward was as comfortable talking about the Wales squad's quiz nights and their occasional treats of burgers and chips as he was about the actual football.\nFor all the lustre the likes of Bale and Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey add to this Wales side, it is the unbreakable team spirit that has been the foundation of their success.\nThe vast majority of the squad have played youth football together, grown up together and become close friends.\nEven when Bale is injured, he will join up with the squad in order to see those he misses while on club duty in Spain - Joe Ledley and Wayne Hennessey are among those he gets on with best.\nThese genuine friendships have bound the team together, as has a tragedy that cast a shadow over football.\nThe death of Coleman's predecessor Gary Speed in 2011 shocked the entire sport, with the grief particularly profound for his young Wales players, many of whom are in the current side.\nCaptain Ashley Williams was clearly moved as he spoke about Speed on the eve of the match against Portugal.\n\"My thought coming in was I hope he'd be proud of us. He saw us grow up, and what we've achieved today,\" he said. \"He's always in the back of our minds. When we achieve something, we think about him.\"\nSpeed was on the supporters' minds as well, with cries of \"There's only one Speedo\" heard at every game.\nA friend of Speed's since childhood, Coleman says he thinks about his former team-mate every day, whether there is a fixture or not.\nSucceeding his friend as Wales manager was a wrench for Coleman but there can be no doubt he and his players have done Speed proud.\nColeman said before the match against Portugal that this run to the semi-finals would not represent the end of his team's journey.\nAbsent from major tournaments for 58 years before Euro 2016, Wales are unwilling to endure another long wait.\nThe current crop of players is ripe for an era of regular qualifying, with Ashley Williams and James Collins the only players over 30 to start the match against Portugal. An average age of just over 27 means Wales' squad was the seventh youngest of the 24 teams at Euro 2016, and Coleman believes this tournament could be a springboard for further success.\n\"The one thing that will stop us from doing it again is ourselves,\" he said.\n\"We're good enough. We have to have the same hunger and desire, and we'll give the World Cup campaign a hell of a crack.\"\nWales will be back in action in September when they host Moldova in their opening qualifier for the 2018 World Cup.\nPlanning for that campaign can wait for now, though. With a homecoming parade taking place in Cardiff on Friday, Wales will take this opportunity to reflect on and revel in the magnitude of their achievement.\nJust as they were at the final whistle in Lyon, Wales' players will be greeted by the great 'Red Wall' in Cardiff.\nReturning home will feel like the end of the journey but, where Coleman and his players are concerned, this is not the final act.",

It has shades of the convenient \"lone wolf\" theory about it. Was he the only player to get this stuff? Did he talk to other players about it?\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand\nHere is my thinking: I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get big. I buy the argument that players are under pressure to get heavier too. The rugby pitch has stayed the same size for 150 years while humans have changed. Rugby is more about going through people than round them now.\nWhat I don't buy is that players are under pressure to buy steroids. It's cheating. The moment you buy the things you are cheating. You know it's not allowed. You are hoping the drug testers never get to you.\nSome players may have contemplated taking steroids but chosen not to do so. If you're not big enough then choose another profession. It's not a game for all shapes and sizes any more.\nCoaches involved in age-group rugby tell me that weight training and supplements appear to be going hand in hand. Young players go to the gym after taking supplements, they drink supplements during their training, and immediately afterwards.\nPerhaps they are being indoctrinated into thinking that there is no way to do this consuming food alone. Maybe, just maybe, the logical next step from that is that artificial aids help, and the last resort - and illegal - artificial aid is your steroid of choice.\nSo is it possible to get big enough taking food alone?\nThe IRB has its latest drug test figures on its website. It states: \"The IRB carried out 1,542 tests both in and out of competition in 2012, across all IRB tournaments and events, including the HSBC Sevens World Series, Rugby World Cup 2015 qualifiers, men's and women's Tests and Age Grade Rugby.\n\"The programme saw a total of 21 anti-doping rule violation cases, equating to 1.36% of the IRB's entire programme.\"\nThat means around 1.4% of elite level players take drugs and try to get away with it. Some of them, you can see from the website, were caught taking the steroid favoured by both Sam Chalmers and disgraced Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, stanozolol.\nThe 2011 Word Anti-Doping Agency figures, also available on the IRB website, show there were 5,553 drug tests globally in rugby in 2011, and 61 violations within them - just over 1%.\nMy guess is that there are more chancing it lower down the leagues, or in that scramble to get into the system - but I don't know.\nWhen I was in South Africa covering the 1995 Rugby World Cup I wrote then what I repeat now - that the biggest growth in requests at GPs in Capetown nearly 20 years ago was from schoolboys wanting prescriptions for steroids. They were often accompanied by parents.\nCould this happen here?\nSam Chalmers was in the most susceptible group, which is young lads who want to get into professional, or at least top-level, rugby.\nIt's going to be tough on him. But life's not easy. It wasn't easy for the players and coaches in the \"Bloodgate\" affair, or in the various eye-gouging allegations, nor for the other 60-odd rugby players caught by the IRB taking drugs or tampering with their samples.\nThis is a test. He does his time and then he gets back in the game.\nI will leave you with this thought: I bet you he wasn't alone in this. And I bet there are younger players than Sam Chalmers who haven't been caught.\nWhat do you think? Are there pressures on players to take steroids?\nYou can follow John Beattie on Twitter @bbcjohnbeattie",

    "input": "\"Did you set this up?\" Salford City Reds owner Dr Marwan Koukash asked, at the start of the station's rugby league hour this week.\nThe extravagant millionaire has grabbed the ailing Reds by the scruff of the neck and set about building a dream in arguably the sport's most crucial year.\nHaving ruffled feathers with his breathtakingly bold bids to sign Sam Tomkins and Adrian Morley, Koukash has promised to make the Super League strugglers the biggest rugby club in the country within three to four years. What he has definitely done is make people talk about Salford again.\nFar from being a prickly atmosphere in the studio, there appeared to be real warmth between the extrovert racehorse owner, the man he wants to coach his club - Brian Noble, and the rugby league legend he wants to sign from Warrington - Adrian Morley.\n\"The more Marwan's the merrier, the better,\" said Noble, the former Great Britain and Bradford Bulls coach still waiting for the right opportunity to return to the sport. \"You just need passionate people with some substance behind them to push the game forward. His passion fills you with enthusiasm, you want to get going and get cracking.\"\nThose comments will have been music to the ears of the fiercely ambitious Koukash, who learned the art of hard work during three years in a refugee camp in Jordan.\nHe admits he would be honoured for Noble to coach the team he is attempting to assemble at Salford. Another Brian - the Australian Brian Smith - is the other frontrunner.\nI understand Noble is keen to work with Koukash, but only if he is convinced the dream of this businessman, tempted into the sport by the RFL's chief executive Nigel Wood, can become a reality.\nA similar discussion about ambition and available funds saw Noble drop out of the running for the Castleford Tigers job before the appointment of Ian Millward, so Salford fans should not expect this to be a done deal.\nKey to the 'Good Doctor's' dream - he was labelled the 'Mad Doctor' during his outlandish early claims of racehorse success - is his campaign to raise the sport's \u00a31.8m salary cap. Koukash has, for the past few weeks, been lobbying to lift the limit that a club can spend on players to something nearer \u00a32.5m.\nHis argument is that this will not only make the rugby league a more attractive proposition for the best players in Australia and halt a talent drain to rugby union, but even reverse the process and tempt union players to league.\nNoble agrees that the cap may need a rethink - it was introduced to stop clubs overspending. But the only man to coach a club to three Super League Grand Final victories believes we might now need a carrot to bring in the bigger names to raise the sport's profile.\nHow much of a financial risk would this be?\nThis is a time the sport cannot even attract a title sponsor for Super League - a situation branded unacceptable by the St Helens chairman Eamonn McManus, who cites his own club's deal with tea-makers Typhoo as proof that the sport can pull in the blue-chip brands.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nKoukash clearly has cash and he wants to be able to spend it. But not every club is in a position to chase success in this way.\nMorley suggests there should be a loophole introduced to have two or three \"star name\" players paid as much as you like outside of the salary cap.\nKoukash added: \"There should be a mechanism in the sport to allow certain scenarios, clubs or situations to go and spend above the cap.\"\nThe man who made his millions from racehorses clearly feels he will be unable to attract rugby league's thoroughbreds to Salford under the current guidelines.\nSuch an argument is unlikely to be met with a huge nod of approval from the likes of Leeds chief executive Gary Hetherington who has built his own successful business model on a strict sliding salary scale at the Super League champions.\nThe bigger question of course is that of the sport's profile in World Cup year. McManus says this is rugby league's \"biggest single financial weakness\".\nThis is not a question about allowing Salford to sign as many players as they want. It is about maximising the exposure of the sport to the world and reaping the financial rewards of that.\nMcManus says the game's governing body needs to take responsibility. \"No sponsor is not acceptable. Either from the club's perspective or from that of the governing body,\" he said.\n\"Someone has to be answerable for that. It is something none of us are happy with and someone needs to be accountable.\"\nMcManus feels that if these weaknesses in the way the game is marketed are \"readily identified and dealt with\" then the game has never been in a stronger position to prosper and grow. Koukash will expect to be at the forefront of that.",

    "input": "As defence correspondent of the Daily Express he beat his rivals to a string of scoops.\nOne of his great strengths was the ability to remember minute details without having to make a single note.\nAfter his retirement he published a series of books alleging Britain's security services had been penetrated by spies at the top level.\nHarry Chapman Pincher, son of an Army officer, was born in India on 29 March 1914.\nHe went to Darlington Grammar School and London University, and graduated  in zoology and botany.\nIronically while at university, some fellow students tried to sign him up to the Soviet cause.\n\"I said to one: 'In the event of a successful revolution, how would the new England be governed?'\n\"He said: 'To start with it would be governed from Moscow.'\n\"So I said: 'Well, bugger that.'\"\nPincher worked as a teacher before joining the Royal Armoured Corps in 1940. He moved to the Rocket Division of the Ministry of Supply in 1943.\nAfter the war he secured a job with the Daily Express as defence, science and medical editor.\nOne of his best contacts, the chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence in the 1950s, was keen to tell him as much as possible about Britain's atomic weapons programme.\nHe wanted to explain to the public why the country was spending such massive sums of money on it.\n\"I'm up for use any time,\" he said. \"If someone wants to come and tell me some news that nobody else knows and I make a lovely scoop of it, come on, use me!\"\nBut it never worried him that he was being used by senior figures with ideas to promote or scores to settle.\nHis investigative methods were unorthodox. Mainly he bought people agreeable lunches and, over the claret, senior civil servants and politicians would tell him things.\nHis favourite lunch venue was a classy French restaurant called L'Ecu de France in Jermyn Street off Piccadilly, handy both for Fleet Street and for the civil servants and politicians in Westminster.\nOnly after it closed did he learn that the place had been bugged by MI5 since the 1940s. (It had also, MI5 discovered when removing its own hidden microphones, been bugged by the KGB.)\n\"MI5 heard every conversation that I had and they did nothing about it,\" he said.\n\"All they did was put it in the files. MI5 doesn't like to take any action; they like to know.\n\"'It's in the files: if we take action, they'll know we know.' That's the attitude. It's absolutely crazy.\"\nPincher cultivated contacts not only at the lunch table but in the countryside.\nIn the 1950s he took up game shooting, and met a good many useful sources while banging away in plus-fours at pheasant and grouse.\nLord Mountbatten, aloof and unapproachable as first sea lord and chief of the defence staff, turned out to be much friendlier when Pincher encountered him shooting.\n\"He invited me to shoot at Broadlands and even dictated a story to me once when I was travelling in his Land Rover, which went straight into the newspaper... but under my name, not his.\"\nIn 1964 he brought into the open the scandal over Ferranti's \u00c2\u00a35 million profit on Bloodhound missiles, which were the major weapon in Britain's air defences.\nThis was a colossal sum at the time and a subsequent inquiry saw the company refunding more than \u00c2\u00a34 million to the Treasury.\nIn 1971, Pincher revealed how the number of staff at the Soviet embassy had increased significantly and claimed that most of the diplomats, chauffeurs and gardeners were really spies.\nThis prompted Edward Heath's government to expel 105 of them, which seriously damaged the Soviet Union's espionage capability.\nAfter his retirement, Pincher's most controversial book was Their Trade is Treachery. This revealed the head of MI5 until 1965, Sir Roger Hollis, had been investigated as a suspected Soviet spy.\nThere was an immense furore, which Pincher doubtless found most gratifying.\nIn the years since, Pincher hardened his line on Hollis, and continued researching the subject becoming convinced that Hollis actually was a Soviet mole.\nNot everyone agrees. Christopher Andrew, MI5's official historian, thinks it's nonsense to suggest Hollis was a traitor.\nRupert Allason, who writes about espionage under the pen name Nigel West, is more nuanced. \"Some people don't believe there was any hostile penetration of the security service.\n\"Personally I've seen the evidence: I know there was penetration up until at least September 1963.\n\"Where I part company with Harry is on the issue of candidates. He believes it was Sir Roger Hollis, I'm not convinced of that; but I am persuaded there was a mole.\"\nOne of the main sources for Pincher's book was the former MI5 agent Peter Wright, whose book Spycatcher was the subject of a long court case to try to prevent publication.\nMargaret Thatcher's government was infuriated by Their Trade is Treachery; but then angering prime ministers was nothing new to Pincher.\nIn May 1959, Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan wrote a personal minute, marked \"secret\", to his minister of defence.\n\"I do not understand,\" he wrote, \"how the Express alone of all the newspapers has got the exact decision that we reached at the cabinet last Thursday on space. Can nothing be done to suppress or get rid of Mr Chapman Pincher?\n\"I am getting very concerned about how well informed he always seems to be on defence matters.\"\nAnd the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson contributed to what may have been Pincher's finest moment in 1967.\nWhat became known as \"the D notice affair\" began with a \"walk-in\", a member of the public who turns up at a newspaper's front door with a possible scoop.\nThe information given to Pincher was that all private cables and Post Office telegrams were being intercepted and that some were being read by GCHQ.\nBefore publishing the story, Pincher checked with a contact called Lt Col Sammy Lohan, secretary of the D notice committee.\nThe D notice system is a voluntary one, designed to alert the news media to stories that might damage national security if published.\nLohan told Pincher his story was not covered by any D notices, and the Express went ahead and printed the scoop.\nWilson was furious and set up an inquiry to show that D notices had in fact been breached. The inquiry concluded the exact opposite, and vindicated the Express.\nIn his Who's Who entry, Pincher listed ferreting in Whitehall and bolting politicians as two of his recreations.\nHe said he didn't regret a single thing he had found out and printed.\n\"I always tried to meet all the top people because that's where the stories lay,\" he said.\n\"When you have access to people you have access to facts, usually secret facts.\"",

That is an increase from the 16 that had taken part in every edition since it was hosted in England in 1996.\nWith six groups of four teams, it means the top two will qualify for the last 16, plus the four best third-placed finishers.

The changes came into effect on 1 June, so will apply for Euro 2016.\nMore than 90 revisions were made, but these are some of the key changes:\nKick-off: Previously, the ball had to go forward from kick-off but the rule has been changed to allow it to go in any direction.\nPre-match red cards: Players can now be sent off before a match gets under way, although they can be replaced by another player in the match-day squad.\nLeaving the pitch after treatment: If a player is injured in a challenge resulting in a yellow or red card, they no longer have to leave the field and can have a quick assessment or medical treatment. This change is designed to prevent situations where a team would be temporarily down to 10 players.\nThe end of 'triple punishment': A professional foul inside the area will now normally result in a yellow card for the offender, and not a red. This is to end the so-called triple punishment of penalty, dismissal and suspension, which was seen by some as excessive. There are exceptions for when the offender will receive a red which include holding, pushing or pulling and violent conduct.\nGoalline technology, already established in the Premier League and elsewhere, will be used at Euro 2016.\nYes. But you had better be quick. Most of the group games - including all of England's matches - are sold out.\nHowever, as of 9 June there are tickets available to watch Wales and Northern Ireland, plus other games involving some of the smaller nations. There are also tickets available for the opening game between France and Romania - at 395 euros each.\nFind the latest ticket details on Uefa's official Euro 2016 website\nEach of the 10 host cities will have official Uefa fan zones.

At such a time, one has to look at the strategy, at refinements that need to be made, at efforts that need to be augmented, and I know that's what's going on right now.\"\n1974: Graduates from West Point US military academy, joining the army\n2007: Leads US troop surge during Iraq conflict\n2008: Head of US Central Command\n2010: Nato commander in Afghanistan\nMid-2011: Leaves military to become CIA director\nNovember 2012: Resigns over affair\nAfter commanding international troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, Gen Petraeus became head of the CIA but was forced to stand down in 2012, following revelations of an extra-marital affair.\nSubsequent allegations that he provided classified information to his mistress while he was CIA director led him to plead guilty to one misdemeanour charge.\nBut despite the turbulence of his private life, Gen Petraeus remains one of the heroes of America's controversial military operations of recent years.\nHe was the architect of the \"surge\" in Iraq that deployed more US troops, but equally important, got them out of their defended compounds to create security at a local level.\nHe also greatly expanded the Anbar Awakening, the mobilisation of Sunni tribesmen to combat al-Qaeda.\nNot surprisingly in the wake of the recent setbacks in Iraq, his views are being canvassed by the White House, the Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill.\nThe keynote of the Petraeus approach today is as it always was - the need for the political and military aspects of strategy to march closely in step.\n\"You cannot deal with an industrial-strength extremist problem just with force of arms,\" he said.  \"You have to have that political component as well.\"\nPolitical change has to start at the top. Above all, Gen Petraeus says, \"the Sunni Arabs have to be given incentives to support the new Iraq rather than to oppose it\".\nAs to the fundamental question - can the Iraqi military actually win against Islamic State? - he has few doubts.\n\"During the surge and in the years after the surge, Iraqi forces fought and died for their country at vastly higher numbers than did US and coalition forces. We know that they can fight,\" he insists.\n\"We know that they will fight. But they will only fight if they have good leadership, and the support and knowledge that somebody will have their back if they get into a tough fight.\"\nThat looks like requiring greater US involvement closer to the frontline. Gen Petraeus is reluctant to give details.\n\"Should there be US advisors with Iraqi forces below the divisional  level?\" he asks. \"Should there be joint teams of tactical air controllers on the ground with security and other assets to support them?\n\"Does there need to be an augmentation of the train-and-equip effort? Can we accelerate the delivery of some of the equipment that Iraq so desperately needs?\"\nIt sounds like the elements of a blueprint for a re-invigorated US effort. But then again - typical Petraeus - there is the political dimension.\n\"Are we doing all that we can to empower and support those Iraqi leaders, starting with Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who recognise the need to bring the Sunni Arab population back into the fabric of Iraqi society? And, most importantly, are our military elements and structures sufficiently supporting the political component and vice versa?\"\nIn response to my comment that all this could have been said a year ago - Gen Petraeus responded by saying that he did indeed say it all a year ago. This is not about re-inventing the wheel.\n\"We need to see the same elements of this (previous) comprehensive civil-military counter- insurgency campaign, albeit today with the Iraqis playing the key roles, enabled by the Americans.\"\nGen Petraeus acknowledges the difficulties of grappling with the horrors in Syria but insists that the only way forward is to train and equip moderate opposition elements. He says that more such fighters will spring up once the programme gets under way.\nAnd he is very cautious about any Iranian role in combating IS. He insists Iran remains a revolutionary power in the region.\n\"This is a country that has made progress because of chaos. It has both benefited from chaos and fomented chaos to try to achieve regional hegemony,\" he says.\nSo he believes that \"while there can indeed be some coincidence of interest between the US, its coalition allies in the region and Iran in terms of the defeat of IS (...) the over-arching context is one that gives you reason to have considerable caution in how you go forward in the relationship with Iran\".\nGen Petraeus still travels to Iraq regularly. He knows the key players well. And though out of uniform and established in a civilian career as an adviser, he remains the man who did achieve a kind of success in Iraq.\nThat is a commodity that is in short supply today for the Americans and the Iraqi authorities. This  makes the Petraeus approach an attractive model.\nBut the question remains: Can the outcome be the same with the Iraqi military cast in the role of the Americans?",

But these new attacks are the most significant yet - rebel forces are attacking key front lines, and there have been repeated air strikes by the Syrian military.\nThis upsurge in fighting is putting new pressure on fragile peace talks. Opposition delegates are now discussing if the time has come to leave Geneva - they are reported to have received a letter from rebel forces on the ground, urging them to exert more pressure on the UN envoy Staffan de Mistura who has been mediating in these indirect negotiations between the warring sides.\nThe opposition is now accusing the UN of bias after Mr de Mistura floated a proposal to allow Syria's President Assad  to remain in office, in a ceremonial role.\nI've heard that idea in recent months from Russian and Iranian sources. But Syrian opposition groups have flatly rejected it - their Western backers are urging them not to walk out but it is becoming increasingly clear that these talks are not going anywhere.\nThe HNC wanted to express its disappointment at the deterioration in the humanitarian situation and in the cessation of hostilities, Mr de Mistura said.\nBut the envoy added that the HNC would remain in Geneva and informal discussions with the two sides would continue with a view to \"taking stock\" on Friday.\nThe US on Monday called on Russia to use its influence on the Syrian government to stop attacks that threatened the seven-week cessation of hostilities as well as the Geneva peace talks, a State Department official said.\nSeparately, President Barack Obama and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held an \"intense conversation\" on Monday that covered Syria, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said.\nMeanwhile, four Syrians including three children in the Turkish town of Kilis were killed in rocket fire from Syrian territory controlled by co-called Islamic State (IS), the local governor's office said.\nThe Turkish military fired artillery in response, Hurriyet newspaper reported.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that rebels had launched an assault on the positions of government forces and their allies in Latakia's northern countryside early on Monday and by midday had made advances.\nThe UK-based monitoring group also said rebels were close to taking over the town of Khirbat al-Naqus, in the strategically important Sahl al-Ghab plain in the north-west of Hama province.\nA Syrian military source confirmed the attacks, according to the Reuters news agency.\nLatakia is the heartland of President Bashar al-Assad's Alawite sect, and the Sahl al-Ghab lies just to the east of the coastal mountains where Mr Assad's ancestral village of Qardaha is located.\nMeanwhile, the Syrian Observatory said four people were killed in heavy government air strikes in northern Homs province.\nTwenty-two civilians were killed over the weekend in Aleppo, with at least 16 dying as a result of rebel shell- and sniper-fire and the six others dying in government air strikes, according to the group.\nMilitants from the group known as Islamic State (IS), which along with the rival jihadist group al-Nusra Front is excluded from the cessation of hostilities, have meanwhile seized more territory from rebel groups near the Turkish border north of Aleppo, forcing some 35,000 civilians to flee towards the opposition-held town of Azaz.\nMedecins Sans Frontieres warned on Monday that the situation was now critical for more than 100,000 displaced people trapped around Azaz, with active fighting just 7km (four miles) away and the border closed for all but the most seriously ill Syrians.",

People should think about their own conduct.\n\"If you are grossly abusive to people, if you are bullying or harassing people online, then we will prosecute in the same way as if you did it offline.\"\nHowever, Ms Saunders said context will be an important factor in decisions - for example \"if you're offensive, the legislation would say you have to be grossly offensive, and that's quite a high test\".\nOne woman, who wished to remain anonymous, said she and her daughter, who has Down's Syndrome, had suffered such severe online abuse over the last six years that they had to move house three times.\nThe abuse started, she said, when a friend wrote a book about trolls - anonymously but mentioning her by name.\n\"The trolls photoshopped images of myself and my daughter on to pornography and posted it on Facebook. They have said I'm a paedophile and called her hateful names like mongoloid; they even set up a website in her name.\"\nThe woman believes the trolls kept getting hold of her details using official forms she submitted when complaining at the use of images of her daughter.\n\"Even after we moved, they have called us at three of four in the morning threatening to petrol-bomb our house if we will not give up the name of the author.\n\"It's been horrific - this trolling is not free speech; it's hate speech,\" she said.\nShe added that one of the men stood outside the family home and followed her daughter to school, taking pictures.\nThe incidents are now being investigated by police.\nKevin Healey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme he had been abused online for five years over his autism campaign work.\nHe said: \"Not even one troll has been prosecuted or jailed, even though I have made complaints to Twitter and the police.\n\"It's been a nightmare; it's been horrific - it doesn't go away. It's with you 24 hours and seven days a week, there's no escape from it\".\nMr Healey said he doesn't think the changes will make any difference and wants changes to legislation in the UK - and abroad.\n\"With the laws in the UK, if someone is trolling you from outside the UK - and my last batch of trolls were from the US - the police said we can't do anything,\" he added.\nThe CPS says it will use \"considerable caution\" before charging those posting \"grossly offensive\" material.\nThe changes come after a report found that one in four teenagers is abused online over their sexual orientation, race, religion, gender or disability.\nThe CPS also said underage \"sexting\" between consenting children in a relationship should not be prosecuted, but cases which involve \"exploitation, grooming or bullying\" may lead to legal action.\nMs Saunders told the BBC: \"If they are children, they are the same age, there's no suggestion or any coercion or bad motives, then we would not expect that case to be prosecuted. It shows you how careful you have to be about the context of it,\" she said.\nAsked about whether guidelines on misogynistic hate crimes would be introduced, Ms Saunders said: \"We probably need to think about it.\"\nA new law on revenge porn - someone uploading explicit images or film of a former partner to humiliate or embarrass them - has led to the prosecution of 206 people across England and Wales since its introduction in April 2015.\nThe public policy statements on hate crime will be subject to public consultation for 13 weeks.",

    "input": "His grandmother offered him a plate of grapes, but she doesn't remember whether Faizan had it. The son of a farmer then put on his pheran, the woollen cape-like garment Kashmiris wear, and quietly left for his Sunday lessons.\nA few hours later, Faizan lay dead near a sun-baked school playground, ringed by bare walnut and willow trees. Paramilitary soldiers, eyewitnesses alleged, had shot him in the back of his head.\nCarrying a packet of biscuits, he was returning home on a bright, nippy morning when he encountered a throng of local people protesting against Indian rule near the school, where polling was taking place for a parliamentary by-election.\nEyewitnesses say four shots rang out of the single-storey, squat school building which, according to some reports, was being pelted with stones thrown by protesters from a hill above and from the road in front.\nFaizan possibly halted to find out what the commotion was all about, and was hit by a bullet. Two neighbours ran up to his home to deliver the news. His mother had sprinted down to the playground, hugged her bleeding son and let others take him to hospital.\n\"I knew he was gone,\" Zarifa told me.\nA heart-wrenching video recorded by a villager on his mobile phone minutes after the killing shows a wailing man cradling the dead boy, blood streaming down his broken face, in a packed vehicle taking him to the nearest hospital. There, the doctors declared him dead.\nFaizan's final journey is recorded on another mobile phone video: his slight frame, draped in white, bobbing slightly on a hospital cot, carried through a sea of weeping, agitated mourners extolling their latest \"martyr\". By late afternoon, his body was lowered into the grave near his village, Dalwan.\nFaizan was among the eight people killed on Sunday when paramilitary soldiers fired bullets and shotgun pellets at those protesting against Indian rule at polling centres near Srinagar, the summer capital. Election authorities say some 170 people, including 100 security personnel, were injured in about 200 incidents of stone pelting and violent protests on the day.\nThe voter turnout in Sunday's election was an abysmal 7.1% - the lowest in decades - and came as a huge setback for the region's mainstream parties.\nThe soldiers had been brought in from other states to secure polling stations and may have been unprepared to deal with \"protests and provocation\" in a complex conflict zone like Kashmir, a senior official told me.\nOne report said the police had registered complaints against the paramilitary forces for firing into the crowds.\nSeparatist groups had rejected the elections and urged voters to boycott Sunday's poll, which took place after a politician resigned over what he described as the \"anti-people\" agenda of the Indian government.\nDisillusioned voters - even in relatively peaceful places like Dalwan where people turned out to cast their votes enthusiastically in previous elections - generally stayed away.\nWhy Faizan was killed on a day when local voters rejected the ballot is not clear.\nBy all accounts, he was not pelting stones or hurling abuse at the soldiers. One report said police fired tear gas shells to keep the protesters away from the empty polling station, but the soldiers opened fire.\nWhatever it is, Faizan became another grisly statistic in Kashmir's unending tragedy.\nA picture taken by his friend on his mobile phone during their winter break shows the shy-looking boy - \"he would often top his class, and he was very knowledgeable about the world,\" the friend said - clad in a woollen cap and collared jacket, peering uneasily into the camera.\n\"He was quiet and studious, he was doing well in school. He played cricket, and counted [former Indian captain] MS Dhoni as his favourite cricketer. He wanted to become a doctor,\" a cousin told me, when I visited the family.\nGrief is the price one pays for love. Zarifa's lament for her dead son filled the still air inside a tent outside their home where local women had gathered to mourn.\n\"My son, my son, where will I find you now?\" she cried, again and again.\nThen she stepped out of the tent, entered her home and joined her husband in a dank, cold room. He sat there, stoic and numb, surrounded by mourners, and gazed vacantly at the pastel pink walls. The room had a red carpet and red window curtains.\n\"The blood of a martyr never goes waste,\" said Fayaz Ahmad Dar. \"One day, the blood of innocents will help us gain our freedom [from Indian rule].\"\nA brief silence followed. Zarifa broke it, bemoaning the loss of her boy.\n\"I am looking at your books, I am looking at your school bags. How will I touch your books again, my son? Everybody would talk about your intelligence, how you would answer every question with so much wit.\"\nOutside the secondary school - Enter to learn, Leave to serve, its motto, is engraved on the walls - a group of young men gathered later in the day. Their eyes seethed in anger. They spoke about frustration, alienation, desperation, humiliation and hopelessness.\nThey said they had lost their fear of life. They insisted that they helped rebels because \"they are our brothers and don't kill civilians\" and are \"fighting for freedom\".\nMore than half of them raised their hands when asked whether they had pelted stones at Indian forces.\n\"We are not safe in our own homes, we are not safe on streets. They are killing little boys now. Life is uncertain,\" said Feroze Ali, a school clerk.\nSince February alone, some two dozen civilians have been killed during gunfights between armed rebels and security forces. The security forces have accused civilians of helping rebels escape.\nThe army says it has tried to reach out and engage with civilians through its 29 schools, youth clubs and cricket tournaments.\nRecently some 19,000 Kashmiri young men applied for a few hundred vacancies in the army.\n\"Provocation and panic can lead to accidents. Security forces often fire when they face life threatening situations. But protecting civilians remains our first priority in this situation. When a civilian dies, it hurts us,\" an army officer told me.\nThe region has seen heightened tension and increased unrest since July when influential militant Burhan Wani was killed by Indian forces. More than 100 civilians lost their lives in clashes with protesters during a four-month-long lockdown, including a 55-day-curfew, in the restive Muslim-majority valley.\nKashmir, clearly, appears to be teetering on the brink of an open public revolt against Indian rule.\nMany say the federal government's near-complete lack of engagement and dialogue with local stakeholders and Pakistan, a complete mistrust of the local government and a lack of development and jobs have left most people jittery and alienated.\nMilitancy continues to be at low ebb - there are an estimated 250 militants in the state now of which 150 are local - compared to several thousand during the peak of insurgency in the 1990s.\nBut young Kashmiris - more than 60% of the men in the valley are under 30, and more than 40% of men in Kashmir are jobless - are restless and angry. The local political parties are in danger of \"becoming irrelevant\", as a leader of an opposition party told me.\n\"This is the worst situation that I have seen. Earlier, it was a movement led by the militants. Now it is being led by the people,\" says Feroze Ali, 35, a schoolteacher.\n\"India needs to be worried, very worried about this.\"",

It did not have the power to do so when the all-Wales franchise was awarded to Arriva.\nThe model this time will focus on what level and quality of service the various bidders can offer. They will be asked to outline what they will do to drive up the numbers of passengers taking trains and buses across Wales.\nWhile the Metro for south Wales will be part of the bid, the company's proposals will also be scrutinised in terms of how they will affect all geographical locations.\nWhichever company wins will have a cap set on how much profit they can make. We do not yet know at what level that will be set but once that is passed remaining profit will go to the body responsible - Transport for Wales - to be reinvested in public transport in Wales. That cap will be for negotiation.\nEach company is expected to put together its own particular mix of heavy rail, bus and possibly light rail. The preferred contractor is expected to be known by early 2018.\nNegotiations are underway with Network Rail about handing over responsibility for the track on the core Valleys lines to the franchise holder.\nThe current franchise is run by Arriva Trains Wales which gets a subsidy from the Welsh Government of between \u00a3150m and \u00a3180m a year.\nRail privatisation laws stop the Welsh Government giving the contract to public sector bodies.\nThe Welsh Government has lobbied for more powers, but said its requests have been turned down in Westminster.\nOfficials said in time TfW may evolve to take on more responsibilities, similar to Transport for London.\nEconomy Secretary Ken Skates said new trains, quicker journeys and modernised technology were priorities for the franchise.\n\"We now have four highly skilled, experienced companies entering the next, competitive phase and I am keen to hear more from them about what they can offer Wales and how they can deliver on our plans for integrated public transport,\" he said.\n\"Over the next 10 years I envisage significant strides in the delivery of our public transport network including the electrification of the Swansea, Valleys and north Wales lines, a South and North Wales Metro and widespread structural improvements that are already in the pipeline.\"",

Because he never took any of this seriously, least of all himself. He was the butt of most of his jokes.\n\"Laugh and the world laughs with you, sure, but Terry knew that if you go one better, and laugh at yourself then you're really onto something.\"\nEvans described Sir Terry as his \"radio dad\" and said that Radio 2 was \"in disbelief and shock\".\n\"He taught me so much about being on the radio and not being on the radio,\" added Evans. \"He was the absolute governor, everybody knows that.\"\nBBC Radio 4 Today presenter John Humphrys also paid tribute on Monday's programme, calling Sir Terry \"one of the greatest broadcasters of our age\".\n\"Terry would be surprised by that description, at least, he'd affect to be. He liked to say that he never did anything, that required more than the minimal effort, and his success was down to 'natural laziness'. Which of course was complete rubbish,\" he said.\n\"You didn't get to be the consummate professional he was by being lazy. It's true that he had a few God-given advantages - he was charming and articulate and witty and quick-thinking and whimsical and subversive and sardonic and, well, the list is a very long one.\n\"But Terry had something else as well. He liked his audience, and they liked him. They felt he wasn't broadcasting to the nation, he was just talking to them.\"\nPrime Minister David Cameron told Jeremy Vine's BBC Radio 2 show Sir Terry was a \"wonderful human being\".\n\"I remember growing up watching Blankety Blank and then the Eurovision Song Contest and he always made you smile, made you laugh.

The couple also had a daughter who died in infancy.\nAn online book of condolences will be hosted on Limerick's official website www.limerick.ie with separate books of condolence at council buildings in Dooradoyle and Merchants Quay opening on Monday morning.\nThe city's mayor said: \"Despite his fame and the fact that he was based in the UK throughout much of his career, Sir Terry often returned home to Limerick and never missed an opportunity on radio or TV to speak about his Limerick roots.\n\"The council honoured him with the title of Freeman of Limerick in 2007, which I know was a title that meant very much to him and his family.\"\nPresident of the Irish Republic Michael D Higgins has said Sir Terry was \"always proud of his origins in Limerick\", and returned frequently to his native country.\nFamily friend and broadcaster Henry Kelly added that he was \"shocked\" to hear of his death because Sir Terry had \"put it out that he had a bad back\".\nThe Game For A Laugh and Going For Gold presenter knew the Wogan family as he had been friends with Sir Terry's younger brother Brian when they were at Belvedere College in Dublin.\n\"I didn't know he was that seriously ill.

His career even included a brief stint in the charts with his 1978 cover of The Floral Dance.\nHe also provided the UK commentary for the annual Eurovision Song Contest for some 28 years, with many viewing his acerbic comments on the show as the highlight of the event.\nFrom 1972 to 1984 he presented the breakfast show on Radio 2 as The Terry Wogan Show, returning after a decade away in 1993 to front the re-branded Wake Up To Wogan.\nThe second incarnation of the show regularly drew more than eight million listeners - dubbed TOGs, or \"Terry's Old Geezers and Gals\".\nTributes poured in as news of his death was revealed on Sunday.\nBBC director general Lord Hall said: \"He was a lovely, lovely man and our thoughts are with his wife and family.  For 50 years Sir Terry graced our screens and airwaves. His warmth, wit and geniality meant that for millions he was a part of the family.\"\nRadio 2 controller Bob Shennan said he was \"one of the greatest and most popular radio hosts this country has ever heard\".\nSir Terry began his career on Ireland's national broadcaster RTE as a newsreader and announcer, moving into light entertainment before joining the BBC, where he would stay for the rest of his career.\nRadio 2 presenter Simon Mayo described him as a \"radio genius\", saying: \"The staple of all great radio is the friend behind the microphone - and he was the ultimate friend behind the microphone.\"\nSir Elton John paid tribute to Sir Terry on his Instagram account.\nThe singer posted a picture of the two of them together, writing: \"Such a special and funny man.\n\"A brilliant broadcaster and presenter.

You have allowed me to share your lives with you.\n\"When you tell me how important I have been in your lives it's very moving. You have been every bit as important in mine.\"\nSir Terry, who continued to front a live Sunday morning show, last appeared on air on Radio 2 on 8 November 2015.\nThe One Show: A Tribute to Sir Terry will be broadcast at 19:00 GMT on Monday 1 February.",

Jamala dedicated it to her great-grandmother and her five children, who were deported by Soviet troops from Crimea in 1944.\nSimon Bennett, head of the International OGAE Eurovision fan club, told the BBC that former Soviet countries that would \"normally vote for Russia\" had sent it a message by voting for Ukraine instead.\nPolitical songs are not allowed at Eurovision, but 1944 was permitted because it was based on historic fact, rather than current politics.\nBBC Music reporter Mark Savage wrote in February that Ukraine's 2004 Eurovision winner, Ruslana, had said the song 1944 had struck a chord over current circumstances in the region.\n\"This song... is precisely what we are all suffering in Ukraine today,\" she said, referencing Russia's seizure of Crimea in 2014.\nJamala simply said after her win: \"I want peace and love for everyone,\" adding at the press conference: \"I was sure that if you talk about truth it really can touch people.\"\nBut John Kennedy O'Connor, broadcaster, author and Eurovision expert, was not happy with Saturday's result.\n\"I'm disappointed that a dirge about genocide and delivering a pointed slap in Russia's face has won this year,\" he told the BBC.\n\"This contest should never be a political platform and I'm almost angry that it's been turned into one, despite the very clear rule book on the matter.\"\nHe said that while third place was an \"excellent result\", the Russians must be \"sick as parrots\" at the moment.\nAlasdair Rendall, president of the Eurovision fan club OGAE UK, said immediate reaction to Jamala's victory was \"mixed\".\n\"Many people admired her strong voice and the impressive visuals on show,\" he told the BBC.\n\"However many are already saying it won due to the strong political message it carried rather than its musical quality.\"\nAs for Australia, Bennett said it was \"neutral and easy to give your votes to\" while O'Connor said it was \"time for them to go away and start AsiaVision now\", referring to a song contest for Asia Pacific countries.\nAnd at the other end of the leaderboard, hopes for the UK's Joe and Jake were dashed when they came third from bottom.\nRendall felt the result was \"totally undeserved\" and Bennett was \"distraught for them\".\nBut O'Connor added: \"The fact that their single is not in the UK top 100 after a month [plus] since its release says it all really.\"\nJoe and Jake told the BBC they had given \"it their all\" and sent \"huge congratulations\" to Jamala.\nThe new voting system also got a mixed reception, with Bennett saying it was \"a disaster that destroyed the atmosphere\"' while Rendall said it had \"really ramped up the tension\".\nIt seems that the only thing everyone agreed on was the show itself.\n\"Congratulations to Swedish TV for putting on one of the most impressive, exciting and high quality Eurovisions ever,\" said Rendall.",

    "input": "An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS \u00a32bn a year.\nMinisters said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter.\nSavings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents.\nOne senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time \"vetting eligibility\" of patients.\nHealth Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to \"turn GPs into border guards\" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a \"fair contribution\".\nMr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must \"transcend\" financial concerns, but collecting an extra \u00a3500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors.\n\"We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one,\" he added.\nBy Nick TriggleHealth correspondent\nThe issue of which foreigners are entitled to treatment and which are not is complex.\nThe first thing to say is if someone needs emergency care - for example if they have an accident - the NHS will treat them no matter where they come from.\nAnother exemption is if someone has an infectious disease as treatment helps protect the wider public.\nBeyond that the UK has reciprocal agreements with most European countries and 28 other nations, including countries such as Canada and Australia.\nIt means if their residents need care while here temporarily - either on holiday or working - they will be seen and the NHS will then reclaim the cost of that care from the other country.\nThe research released by the Department of Health shows the NHS is not very good at clawing that money back. This is because of a perverse incentive in the system which ministers now want to rectify.\nMeanwhile, travelling to the UK deliberately for health treatment - so-called health tourism - is not allowed.\nThe rules are less clear in other cases, such as expats and asylum seekers.\nThe latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research.\nThe government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the \"most thorough research there has ever been\" in this area.\nThe report itself notes that it is based on \"incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions\", but it says the estimates are the \"best that can be made at present\", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been \"completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know\".\nThe government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue.\nIt has already announced a \u00a3200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise \u00a3200m a year.\nA cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK.\nMeanwhile, \"deliberate health tourism\" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between \u00a360m and \u00a380m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is \"uncertain\" and the \"plausible range\" of the cost is \u00a320m-\u00a3100m.\nFrequent visitors \"taking advantage\" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further \u00a350m-\u00a3200m a year, the report adds.\nThe government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the \"conservative\" \u00a3500m figure.\nTo achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks.\nFree NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so.\nAsylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment.\nThe UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care.\nThe NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just \u00a373m a year is recouped out of more than \u00a3460m at present.\nThis is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care.\nShadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: \"We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment.\"\nBut he added the figures were based on a \"large number of assumptions\" and was more about \"spin than substance\".\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's \u00a3500m savings figure was \"exaggerated\", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans.\nHe said migrants paying the proposed \u00a3200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to \"get their money's worth\", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than \u00a3200.\nDr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments.\nDr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a \"new border agency\" in policing the NHS.\n\"The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments,\" she said.\nJonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been \"hugely overstated\" and was in fact a \"very small part of NHS expenditure\".",
