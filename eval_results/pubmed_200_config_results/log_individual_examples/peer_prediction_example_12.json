  "reference": "medical tourism is illustrated as occurrence in which individuals travel abroad to receive healthcare services ( 1 ) . \n it is a multi - billion dollar industry and countries like india , thailand , singapore , malaysia , belgium , costa rica , cuba , dubai , hungary , israel , jordan , south africa and many others are being benefited in their economy by this recent phenomenon ( 2 , 3 ) . \n the prime driving factors in medical tourism are increased medical costs , increased insurance premiums , increasing number of uninsured or partially insured individuals in developed countries , long waiting lists for procedures in countries having public healthcare system , availability of high quality services at affordable price , and cheaper airfare . increased communication and internet access in developing countries \n are other supporting factors , which help patients to develop awareness about international travel for medical care ( 47 ) . \n estimations can vary but still some of reliable sources claim ; gross medical tourism revenue worldwide was more than us$ 40 billion in year 2004 and reached up to us$ 100 billion by year 2012 ( 8) . in year 2007 \n , it was estimated that around 750,000 us residents traveled abroad . accordingly , the base case estimated form 2007 to 2010 for the annual growth rate for outbound patients was 100 per cent in us ( 9 ) . \n forbes business estimated around 1.25 million americans were expected to travel outside for medical treatment in year 2014 ( 10 ) . \n after thorough review it was found that there is huge gap in literature available in medical tourism . \n accounts detailing size and market of the industry are large in number yet there is scarcity of literature detailing about role and significance of different variables and linking them to form conceptual and theoretical framework which reflects decision making of international patients for taking part in medical tourism . \n available literature explore various factors related to patients travel such as source of information , perceived risks , benefits of medical tourism and attributes of medical tourism destinations in sufficient amount but almost all of these related accounts are exploratory in nature and do not provide conceptual frameworks for testing . \n many researchers ( 2 , 6 , 11 , 12 ) made calls to explore more about the decision making process based on conceptual models and test them empirically , so managers in medical tourism industry will be more acquainted about the needs and requirements of patients and design their future strategies accordingly and at the same time patients will also be benefited by receiving more quality services from the providers . \n this article will draw a conceptual model based on patients source of information , perceived benefits , perceived risks , and medical tourism destination image with available literature that will be helpful to mangers to draw their future course of action for competitive advantage and at the same time fulfill the gap in available literature . \n image formation agents are the factors which control the perception and evaluation of image ( 13 ) . researchers addressed amount and diversity of information sources that expose individuals including information related to destination acquired through visiting particular place . \n various studies performed on destination selection behavior of tourists explored that with combination of other different factors , information sources explored by individuals determined certain destinations as possible alternatives ( 1317 ) . \n consumer behavior studies have already established the effects of source of information on purchase behavior ( 18 ) . \n amount and type of different information sources directly influence in development of cognitive image formation of destination ( 19 ) . \n source of information is a vital antecedent of destination image formation and destination choice intention ( 20 ) . \n there are four ( i ) professional advice ( tour operators , travel agents , airlines ) ( ii ) word of mouth ( friends , relatives , social media ) ( iii ) advertisement , and ( iv ) news / books / movies , different categories of type of information sources usually consider responsible for destination image formation ( 13 ) , this article use these four categories of source of information for medical tourism destinations image formation . \n medical tourism facilitators are specialized in promotion of medical services abroad and offer supportive services such as assisting in selection of country and hospital , correspondence with doctors , travel arrangements , and arrangements of required paper work ( 21 , 22 ) . \n judgment of agent related to travel of their clients has high influence on decisions of clients ( 23 ) . \n these facilitators serve as motivators also due to providing much - needed assistant to those unenthusiastic potential international patients who do not want to make their trip arrangements by their own . \n many hospitals and clinics linked themselves with airlines to promote their services and offer discounts ( 2 , 5 , 2426 ) . \n literature on medical tourism also reveals the role of practitioner in promotion of medical tourism mainly in underdeveloped countries due to various reasons such as lack of resources , unavailability of equipment , unavailability of infra - structure , unavailability of specialized manpower , and unavailability of medication ( 2730 ) . \n word of mouth and recommendation also has high influence in decision making of international patients in selection of destinations , hospitals , and doctors . \n studies revealed large numbers of patients visit different countries for medical services were received recommendations from family members , friends , relatives , and colleagues ( 3134 ) . \n websites and online forums created by experienced international patients to share their experiences with medical tourism are also considered as decisive source of information for those planning to take medical services abroad ( 35 , 36 ) . \n printed materials are also used to promote the services by hospitals and clinics , for example air mauritius in - flight magazine provides details about procedures and services provided by the hair grafting clinics in mauritius ( 2 ) . \n major medium of promotion of services by destination countries are trade fairs , travel markets / travel fairs , exhibitions , seminars and conferences to make potential patients informed about products and services offered by destinations . \n some of these fairs and exhibitions are organized in collaboration with government agencies like tat , ministry of foreign affairs and department of export promotion but some providers organized these events by their own in cooperation with local institutes , medical schools and universities ( 37 ) . \n print media play an important role in promotion and advertising medical tourism in major source countries , publish attractive and evidence based stories in their different segments related to health and travel . \n los angeles time first examined about the growth of medical tourism and marked it as trend . later on new york times and los angeles times published stories of satisfied patients . \n fox , cbs s  60 minutes  and cnn aired their segments on patients traveling to medical services . \n magazines like forbes and wall street journal analyzed the business aspect of medical tourism as  brokers assertively marketed medical tourism to consumers , employers , and insurers ( 38 ) . \n literature revealed that not every physical attribute of a destination has influence on image formation process . \n there is substantial inequality between descriptive dimensions of image and the attributes which are considered important for decision making within individuals ( 39 ) . \n it is generally presumed in marketing that products with similar characteristics will be equally preferred by the consumers , however , attributes , which make the product similar to other products , will not be necessarily same at the time of actual purchase . the importance of attributes will be change according to the need of consumer ( 40 ) . wish ( 1971 ) cited in ( 40 ) found that despite have many similarities individual like one country and dislike another one . \n this is due to dimensions of liking may not be agree with the dimensions of similarity . \n literature revealed that many researchers made distinction between physical and beneficial aspect of a product . \n few researchers explained it as  characteristic and  benefits to the physical and beneficial aspect of product respectively ( 41 ) . \n the typology of different attributes of product has been proven fruitful because by this a product s features can be segments into three groups as characteristic , beneficial , and imagery . \n there are three components of vacation destination image formation ; ( i ) based on awareness : rely on the information sources , tourist believes about what a destinati...",
