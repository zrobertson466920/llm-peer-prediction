    "– Herman Cain might just be a wee bit misinformed about China. In a quick exchange from his PBS News Hour interview last night, spotted by Raw Story, Cain was asked if China was a military threat. “Yes, they’re a military threat,” he replied. \"They’ve indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability … So yes, we have to consider them a military threat.\" There’s just one little inaccuracy there: China has had nuclear weapons since 1964. Cain has never claimed to be a foreign policy guru—he once boasted that he didn’t know who the president of \"Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan\" was, a remark that greatly amused Hillary Clinton. In last night’s interview, he also said he wouldn’t send troops into Syria, saying the situation was “sad” but that the US couldn’t get involved. “I want to first make sure that we stop giving money to our enemies,” he said. The US does not send aid to Syria, but Cain may have been making a more general point.",
