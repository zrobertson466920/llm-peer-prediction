  "reference": "the synthetic modification \n of proteins enables the construction \n of biomolecular hybrids that can be used to study protein function , deliver potent therapeutics to cellular targets , and build new materials . \n the synthesis of these constructs requires a suite of chemoselective \n bioconjugation reactions that proceed under mild , aqueous conditions \n in the presence of the native functional groups that are present on \n protein surfaces . \n the most common methods for protein modification \n target the nucleophilic side - chains of lysine and cysteine . however , these strategies can \n result in complex product mixtures , as lysine is typically found in \n high abundance on the protein surface and \n uniquely reactive cysteine labeling sites can be difficult to install \n in many instances ( such as thiol proteases and proteins produced via \n the eukaryotic secretory pathway , for example ) . many newer approaches \n for the site - selective modification of proteins \n involve the introduction of artificial amino acids with reactivities \n that are orthogonal to those of the native \n amino acids . along these lines , \n a number of powerful methods have \n been developed for the selective modification of azide , alkyne , alkene , carbonyl , and aniline moieties . \n however , the difficulty \n of introducing a non - canonical amino acid can limit the application \n of these methods . \n complementary approaches rely on the site - selective \n modification of native amino acids by enzymes . \n in addition , a reliable method for the modification of c - terminal \n thioesters with n - terminal cysteines , termed  native chemical \n ligation  , has been developed by kent and co - workers . \n this method has been used for the semi- and total synthesis of complex \n protein substrates , including the chemical synthesis of a single glycoform \n of human erythropoietin . as an alternative \n strategy , \n we and others have developed methods \n for the selective modification of the n - terminal amino group . \n methods that target the n - terminus can offer significant advantages \n for bioconjugate preparation , as they can be used for a wide range \n of protein targets produced by virtually any expression system . conceptually \n powerful as they are , however , these methods can be hampered by long \n reaction times , often require large excesses of reagent , and/or involve \n at least two - steps for the attachment of synthetic molecules . \n we have \n therefore sought to develop new techniques that can achieve n - terminal \n modification with similarly high positional selectivity , but with \n significantly improved efficiency . \n herein , we report an oxidative \n coupling pathway that can preferentially \n modify the n - terminus of proteins with fast kinetics . \n peptide substrates \n were first used to screen reaction conditions and identify the site \n of modification . a peptide panel with varying n - terminal residues \n was then evaluated to determine the sequence specificity of the reaction , \n leading to the identification of proline as the optimal n - terminal \n amino acid . \n the reaction was next applied to protein substrates , showing \n similarly high levels of conversion when an n - terminal proline residue \n was present . \n this mild bioconjugation reaction enables the facile , \n rapid modification of proteins to create a well - defined and stable \n linkage in a single position , and thus should be useful for many different \n applications in chemical biology and the construction of biomolecular \n materials . \n we have previously reported \n the chemoselective coupling of aniline \n moieties on proteins to electron - rich aromatic rings , such as o - aminophenols , at slightly acidic ph ( 6.06.5 ) . \n these reactions require the addition of naio4 or k3fe(cn)6 as a terminal oxidant , with the latter \n reagent exhibiting improved compatibility with glycoproteins and substrates \n with free sulfhydryl groups . the use of ferricyanide as the oxidant \n also yields a single reaction product ( 1 ) , whereas periodate \n leads to the formation of a ring contracted species as a competing \n pathway . \n the ferricyanide - based reactions \n are presumed to involve an o - iminoquinone as the \n reactive intermediate , as suggested in scheme 1 , or could involve the corresponding o - quinone after \n imine hydrolysis . taken together , the oxidative coupling strategies \n have demonstrated excellent functional group compatibility and the \n ability to join large unprotected biomolecules at low concentrations , \n as demonstrated for the coupling of peptides , polymers , and nucleic \n acids to specific locations on viral capsids and antibody fc domains . while these coupling reactions \n were found to be highly aniline - selective \n under the conditions used , several studies have reported the reaction \n of o - aminophenols and o - catechols \n with native amino acids , dating back to 1949 . \n in addition , recent work by messersmith has shown the ability of \n proteins to be coupled to o - quinone moieties present \n on polydopamine - coated surfaces . \n these reports \n suggested that secondary coupling pathways could be developed to achieve \n the modification of native amino acids with o - aminophenols \n ( scheme 1 ) , and thus initial experiments were \n designed to identify the optimal reaction conditions for achieving \n this with complex molecules . in our previous \n work \n , we noted that low amounts of background reactivity could be \n observed in aniline - based oxidative coupling reactions when higher \n ph conditions ( > ph 6.5 ) were used . in \n an initial effort to characterize this alternative reaction pathway , \n conditions and reaction times \n were first screened to increase the \n reaction yields for peptides that did not contain aniline groups . \n angiotensin i and melittin were used as substrates , as they contain \n many reactive amino acids , including lys , arg , his , trp , and tyr . \n the peptides were exposed to 2-amino - p - cresol using \n k3fe(cn)6 as the oxidant . \n the reaction ph was \n varied from 5.5 to 8.5 , and the reaction mixtures were analyzed using \n maldi - tof ms ( supporting information figure \n s1 ) . \n the level of modification increased with the basicity of the \n reaction , with near quantitative modification of angiotensin i after \n 20 min at ph 7.5 and higher . throughout these initial investigations , \n it was noted that angiotensin and melittin showed significant differences \n in reactivity , with angiotensin consistently demonstrating better \n conversion . \n ms / ms analysis of the angiotensin product was used to \n identify the participating residue , and revealed that the n - terminal \n amino group was responsible for the observed reactivity ( supporting information figure s2 ) . as further \n confirmation of the site - selectivity , \n several peptide substrates were \n screened for reactivity ( figure 1a and supporting information figure s3 ) . \n consistent \n with the n - terminal reaction selectivity , the only peptide that did \n not react had a pyroglutamate in this position , and therefore no free \n amino group . \n ( a ) \n modification of commercially available peptides was monitored by maldi - tof \n ms . \n ( b ) a positional scan of the n - terminal amino acid was \n evaluated . \n peptides with the sequence xadswag were tested for reactivity with 2-amino - p - cresol . \n the reactions were run with 100 m peptide , 200 m \n aminophenol , and 5 mm ferricyanide at ph 7.5 and analyzed by lc  ms . \n shown is the average percent modification with error bars representing \n the standard deviation of three reactions . \n the same peptides were \n used for a screen of coupling partner equivalents ( c ) and a time screen \n ( d ) . \n most buffers did not alter the reactivity , but \n imidazole and buffers containing a morpholine or piperazine ring ( pipes , \n hepes , hepps , and mops ) significantly impeded the reaction ( supporting information figure s4 ) . \n this is possibly \n due to small amounts of buffer impurities that react competitively \n with the oxidized intermediate . \n the time course of the reaction was \n also investigated ( supporting information figure s5 ) . \n in addition , it was found that the peptides could be modified \n using naio4 as the oxidant , or 4-methylcatechol as the \n coupling partner ( supporting information figures s67 ) . both of these reactions showed the same dependence \n on ph ; however , moderate levels of modification were still observed \n at acidic ph ( 5.56.5 ) when using these alternative coupling \n conditions . \n these observations suggested that the peptides were reacting \n with the o - quinone intermediate formed in \n situ from either the catechol or the iminoquinone precursor \n ( after imine hydrolysis ) . \n given the differential \n reactivity observed on peptide substrates , we synthesized peptides \n with varied n - terminal residues ( xadswag ) to determine the specificity of the reaction . \n the bas...",
