      "context": "Washington (CNN) -- Greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to public health and welfare, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson said Monday. \"The overwhelming amount of scientific studies show that the threat is real,\" she said. The announcement stems from a Supreme Court ruling which ordered the agency to determine the impact of carbon emissions not only on the environment, but on public health. iReport: Share your thoughts on climate change . \"These long-overdue findings cement 2009's place in history as the year when the United States government began addressing the challenge of greenhouse-gas pollution and seizing the opportunity of clean energy reform,\" Jackson said. Immediately after the announcement, Jackson was leaving for Copenhagen, Denmark, to participate in the Copenhagen Climate Conference ahead of President Obama's appearance at the end of the week. Her statement could provide evidence to the conference that the agency and the Obama administration are taking global warming seriously. However, Jackson said that Monday's announcement does not require any immediate regulatory action. The Obama administration is pushing for comprehensive energy legislation from Congress that puts a price on carbon emissions, a so-called \"cap and trade\" policy that uses market forces as an incentive for businesses to reduce carbon emissions. Jackson said carbon dioxide emissions go beyond damaging the environment -- they also endanger public health. The agency made the announcement because it is required to issue an \"endangerment finding\" -- evidence that carbon emissions are dangerous to the public health -- before it can regulate carbon dioxide and five other greenhouse gases under the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA said in April that it would likely make such a ruling regarding carbon emissions and public health. The agency completed a public-comment process before making the announcement.

      "context": "WASHINGTON (CNN) -- If one hardened cockpit door is good, would two barriers be even better? Many airline pilots believe the answer is \"yes,\" and are hoping to reinvigorate efforts to require so-called \"secondary barriers\" on every commercial plane in the country. Pilots praise the hardened cockpit doors mandated after 9/11, saying they have done as much as anything to protect aircraft from terrorist assaults. But planes remain vulnerable for short periods of time during some flights when pilots go to the lavatory, get meals or, on long flights, change out crews. Currently, flight attendants sometimes block the aisle with beverage carts to prevent possible terrorists from rushing the cockpit. But pilots believe the barriers -- relatively inexpensive gates that would be deployed before pilots come out of the cockpit -- would solve that vulnerability. \"This is an absolute no-brainer,\" Capt. Bob Hesselbein of the Air Line Pilots Association said. \"Of all the things we could do, the most cost-effective thing we could do right now is put the device in.\" ALPA this summer published a position paper calling on the U.S. and Canadian governments to require secondary flight deck barriers on all airliners by January 1, 2010. The barriers would be designed to delay anyone trying to attack the cockpit by at least five seconds, giving pilots time to retreat to the cockpit, ALPA said. Hijackers have attempted to gain access to flight decks on planes overseas four times in the past year, according to ALPA. The airline industry has fought efforts to require the barriers, saying airlines should be allowed to decide for themselves if the barriers would improve security. The barriers would not be useful on short hauls where pilots don't ordinarily leave the cockpit, and the airline industry claims other layers of protection are sufficient on longer flights. Hesselbein disagrees. \"You can never guarantee that you're going to have an armed pilot protecting that cockpit from inside that cockpit. You can never guarantee that you're going to have a federal air marshal, or federal air marshal team, in the cabin to defend that cockpit. \"But the secondary barrier, once installed, will always be there,\" Hesselbein said. The government has classified the number of federal air marshals and armed pilots, but it is widely known that they cover a small percentage of flights in the U.S. In a June 2005 report to Congress, the Transportation Security Administration said the barrier \"appears to be a simple solution that offers greater security at a relatively low cost.\" \"Valuable time is gained in deterring the movement of an unauthorized individual towards the flight deck,\" the report said. But the TSA recommended against mandating secondary barriers, citing \"the costs of engineering and installation that would be incurred by the [airlines] to retrofit\" aircraft. \"The economic fragility of the industry due to increasing costs, including persistently rising fuel prices, makes this a decisive recommendation.\" The Air Transport Association, which represents the nation's major airlines, said hardened cockpit doors and other measures provide effective security and that mandating other measures should not be done \"in the absence of appropriate risk analysis.\" Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, said he is again introducing a bill to require barriers on passenger planes. \"Everybody recognizes the vulnerability,\" he said. \"The airline industry recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the federal government ought to pay for the secondary barriers. The federal government recognizes the vulnerability and thinks that the airline industry should pay. \"Meanwhile, for as long as the debate continues, the flying public is less safe.\" E-mail to a friend .",

The 11-year-old says his 10-year-old friend Temashi spent two days \"scratching\" the image onto his skin with a match stick. It only hurt a little bit, said Brian, one of thousands of Zimbabwean children who have fled their ravaged homeland for what they hope will be a better life in South Africa. For Brian and his friend, the symbol of the swastika does not represent the horrors of Hitler and the Holocaust. Instead, they say the ominous jagged lines on their arms mean \"Germans never surrender.\" It is a twisted interpretation that, however misguided, gives strength to Brian, marking him as a \"man\" and \"someone who does not surrender,\" he said quietly in a soft voice.  Watch the boys explain what the tattoos mean to them \u00bb . Brian and his young compatriots from Zimbabwe are on their own in a new country. Charities such as Save the Children and UNICEF classify them as \"unaccompanied minors,\" but those words do not begin to describe their situation. They endure unimaginable hardships traveling to South Africa by themselves or with small groups of friends. They hitch rides on trucks, trains and taxis. Brian and his friends told CNN that when they got to the South African border at Beitbridge authorities let them walk through without passports or other documents. They then made their way to the border town of Musina, where boys beg on the streets or work on farms, and girls seem to disappear into South African society. UNICEF representative Shantha Bloemen said many Zimbabwean girls either turn to prostitution or work as domestic servants. Nearly all of the children -- some younger than 10 -- leave Zimbabwe because they hope their life will be better in South Africa. They said hunger, non-functioning schools and poverty were the reasons they left. Many are orphans, while some have parents, but they all dislike Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's regime -- a government that has left them with no choice but to abandon their homes and join the exodus south. A quarter of Zimbabwe's population has fled the country, mostly to neighboring South Africa, Botswana and Mozambique, humanitarian groups said. The United Nations and Save the Children, which has an office based in Musina, report there has been a troubling increase in the number of children under 18 years old who are making the risky journey south from their homes in Zimbabwe to South Africa in search of work and food. Social workers from Save the Children and UNICEF told CNN that in June, 175 Zimbabwean children came over the border illegally and alone. In November, 1,016 kids made the same perilous journey. The boys older than 16 hang around Musina, sleeping on the sidewalk by a sports stadium along with older homeless men. Their days are spent waiting in line, jostling alongside hundreds of Zimbabwean adults, trying to apply for political asylum at a makeshift center opened by South African authorities. A South African official who processes asylum applications says it is common for youngsters to lie about their age so they can get the papers to stay in the country legally. Many, though, cannot get the necessary papers because they do not carry documentation or have adults who can vouch for who they are and where they come from. So, they wander the streets, begging for money. The younger ones like Brian are picked up by police and housed in a safe place until authorities and aid agencies can figure out what to do with them. While they wait for a future that never seems to arrive, boys like Brian and Temashi -- a legacy of Mugabe's regime -- struggle to survive in the world they now find themselves in.",

      "context": "NASHVILLE, Tennessee (CNN) -- A singer took center stage at a Nashville honky-tonk to promote his new album. He had the good looks and easy charm of a movie star. Kevin Costner is putting his energies into music. His new record is \"Untold Truths.\" Only in this case, he was a movie star. Kevin Costner recently celebrated the release of \"Untold Truths\" -- his debut country record -- with a free show at The Stage on Broadway. He was backed by his band, Modern West, which also features guitarist John Coinman and bassist Blair Forward -- two men he met 20 years ago in an acting class. The three have been making music on and off since then, with Costner on lead vocals and rhythm guitar. Back in the day, they called themselves Roving Boy. Truth be told, the 2008 incarnation -- Kevin Costner and Modern West -- does not sound like a movie star's vanity project. It's contemporary Americana set against a Western backdrop. Costner sings about freight trains, dusty avenues and broken dreams in a voice that's pleasant, if not terribly distinct. In faded jeans and a toffee-colored cashmere sweater, he commands the stage with the same understated sex appeal he has on the big screen. At 53, Costner is the soft-spoken, heroic everyman we've seen time and again in such movies as \"Dances With Wolves,\" \"The Bodyguard\" and \"Field of Dreams\" -- except today he's wielding an acoustic guitar instead of a baseball bat. The mission statement from \"Field of Dreams\" seems to apply to his philosophy as a recording artist: \"If you build it, they will come.\" Plenty of fans did come to his show that night, but earlier in the day, we caught up with the busy superstar during his rehearsal -- which he had opened up to a group of local college students in a Grammy-sponsored \"SoundCheck\" session.  Listen to Costner kick it with his band \u00bb . CNN: Even though your album, \"Untold Truths,\" is being marketed as a country album, your sound is really more rootsy than traditional country. Kevin Costner: Yeah. It's just music. CNN: What made you decide to put out an album? Costner: My wife said, \"Look, you are the happiest by far when you are making music. Why don't you keep on making music?\" CNN: People may not know this, but you've been making music for a long time. Costner: Yeah, for a long time. I have been doing a lot of things for a long time. (chuckles) It's not like we called up and said, \"Hey, we have a garage band. Can we show up?\" We have been working really hard at this for three years. All of it has been under the radar just because we have not felt like publicizing it. It has kind of happened in the way we wanted it to -- which was more of a grassroots situation, people discovering the band. CNN: When you were talking to the students, you spoke a lot about being fearless. Costner: Their choices are going to be questioned not only by their colleagues, but by their parents. You only get one shot at this life. They can go to college and learn a lot of things, but they should also be encouraged to try things, even if they don't succeed. I am trying -- even if I don't succeed. You know, failure is completely underrated in America. (smiles) CNN: With this new project, there's the possibility of having your head handed to you on a platter. Costner: Well, that will happen no matter what I do -- so I'm not worried about that. I have to get over my own bar on what I think is acceptable. CNN: And what is that? Costner: I don't know. It's just a moment when you feel you've given an honest effort. CNN: You have trouble stuffing everything you want into a three-hour movie, let alone condensing things into a three-minute song. How do you -- . Costner: I don't have that hard a time! CNN: Oh, come on! Costner: I make jokes about it a lot. You know, I make one-hour, 59-minute movies! But yeah -- telling the story, I don't believe in some conditional running length. I just believe in telling the story -- musicially or cinematically. CNN: You met John -- one of your guitar players -- in an acting class 20 years ago. Costner: Yeah, a long time ago. Blair (his bass player), the same. Like anybody with good sense, you keep people who have been really true and honest with you around you. CNN: Which is more cutthroat, the movie business or the music business? Costner: There is cutthroat stuff in everything -- these corporations going under, and people ducking for exits, pointing fingers. You know, it is a cycle of life. Then someone else will take that spot, some heavy hitter. Maybe it is good to take a lesson. You have to be a little humble because maybe one day, you are not that big, swinging dog you think you are. CNN: Do you ever feel like that in your own career? Costner: Well, I am aware that a career that takes chances isn't always going to ring a bell. It is not the greatest risk in the world to not be the most popular person, or the number one person, because that is a pretty fleeting thing to begin with. CNN: Do you read reviews? Costner: No. Sometimes they are read to me. \"Look what he said!\" I am like, \"Please don't show me.\" CNN: Are you planning to make more albums? Costner: I will be making more music. We'll see where it lands. We made a record. We made it as good as we could make it, and now we let it go. And we go and write a better song. CNN: In the meantime, you have a show to put on. Costner: There is a moment for two hours when you are really burning, and that is a great feeling. Some people like to jog because that somehow does something for them. When you perform, for me, it's like filling up the gas tank.",

      "context": "(CNN) -- Texas Rep. Ron Paul is making his third bid for the White House armed with the same libertarian-leaning stances that cultivated a dedicated following during his 11 terms in the House of Representatives. Those positions -- calls for limited government, reduced federal spending and less U.S. involvement overseas -- are now in the fore of national politics with the rise of the Tea Party and the country's financial situation. Paul is perhaps most famous for his calls to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Reserve and return to a gold standard, views he often advocates as a member of the House Financial Services Committee. And as a member of the International Relations Committee, he has consistently voted against authorizing military action overseas and opposed U.S. support for the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization. He has also called for constitutional amendments to abolish personal income, estate and gift taxes. But those are some of the same issues that made him and his son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, darlings of the Tea Party movement and especially popular among young conservatives whom he visits on college campuses across the country. He often says he was fighting for those issues before they were popular. More Ron Paul coverage on the CNN Political Ticker . \"Mainstream is now thinking about these things. Before, mainstream was deficits don't matter, print money when you need it, endless wars, personal privacy that didn't mean anything,\" Paul said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" recently. \"But believe me, mainstream is moving in the direction that I have been talking about for a long time, and therefore nobody knows what the outcome will be in this election.\" Although he raises significant campaign funds, fundraising success doesn't necessarily translate to electoral wins. While running for the 2008 GOP nomination, Paul raised $20 million in the last quarter of 2007, mostly through individual contributions, which was twice as much raised by eventual Republican nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona. But he barely breached 10% in the early presidential voting states. After he dropped out of the race in June 2008, he used his remaining funds to form Campaign for Liberty, designed to support candidates who agreed with his policy stances. An early champion of virtual campaigning, Paul coined the term \"money bomb\" for setting a fundraising goal over a set period of time on his website. He raised more than $1 million during his most recent \"money bomb\" in June but fell short of the $2 million goal. The Pittsburgh native first ran for the White House in 1988 as the Libertarian Party candidate against Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis, ultimately receiving 0.5 percent of the vote, or 432,000 votes, in the general election. But don't expect him to seek a third-party bid in 2012. \"We don't have a democracy in this country. It's so biased,\" Paul told CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. \"If you're a third party, you can't -- I can't get into debates as a third-party candidate. When I did it as a third party, I spent over half my money just to get on the ballot.\" As a GOP candidate he will also promote more socially conservative stances, popular with Republican voters in many of the early nominating states. He has said he believes marriage is the union between a man and a woman, but voted in 2004 and 2006 against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage, something he said is an increase in federal power. Paul also told Wolf Blitzer in May that he supports the \"protection of all human life.\" \"I'm for repealing Roe v. Wade. And it's not an attack on women's rights,\" Paul said on CNN's \"The Situation Room.\" \"Women have rights, but they also have a responsibility if they're responsible for life.\" Paul has a unique perspective as a specialist in obstetrics/gynecology who has delivered more than 4,000 babies. After graduating from Gettysburg College and the Duke University School of Medicine, he served as a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force before moving to Texas with his wife Carol and eventually representing the 14th District that includes the cities of Victoria and Galveston. He will be 77 in 2012, but Paul, a father of five and grandfather of 18, said he doesn't feel old. \"Where do I get my energy and where do I get my support and the enthusiasm? It comes from the young people,\" Paul told Blitzer. \"That really excites me because this issue is so important. It's important to my kids. It's an important point to all the kids of America.\"",

      "context": "San Diego, California (CNN) -- Even though they were stuck without air conditioning, hot showers and decent meals, some of the passengers who made it off a crippled Carnival Cruise Lines ship said Friday that they would go on a cruise again. \"I'm so thankful that we're all alive,\" Leticia Lewis said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" \"I don't wish this experience on anyone. It wasn't a wonderful event. But I would take another one.\" Amber Haslerud, another passenger, said her voyage on the ill-fated Carnival Cruise ship Splendor was her first cruise, and she would also go on another one. \"I definitely would give it another go and try to get the experience I should have had this time,\" said Haslerud. \"I deserve it after all that we went through this week.\" The ship and its approximately 3,300 passengers arrived in San Diego on Thursday, four days after a fire in the engine room left the ship without air conditioning, hot showers or refrigeration one day into a scheduled seven-day cruise along the Mexican coast. \"It was absolutely deplorable,\" passenger Marquis Horace said. At one point, the ship ran out of food, he said, and \"they started making mayo sandwiches.\" Passengers said they weren't told there was a fire until they left the ship. Horace said the crew informed passengers only of \"a flameless fire.\" Carnival spokeswoman Jennifer de la Cruz said officials initially spoke only of smoke because the crew couldn't get into the engine room to assess the situation. Passengers were advised of the fire once it was confirmed, she said. Maritime law doesn't require cruise lines to tell passengers about onboard problems, said Robert Jarvis, a professor of law at Nova Southern University in Fort Lauderdale, Flordia. He said it sometimes makes sense to limit or delay the release of information to avoid a panic. Carnival's position is to inform passengers any time an issue will affect their cruise, de la Cruz said. The cruise line has said it plans to give customers who were aboard the Splendor a full refund, reimbursement for travel costs and a free cruise. Natalie Martinez and Angela Evans are among those who said they would also go on another cruise. But they said they would bring a survival kit with flashlights, chocolate and air freshener. And \"I think we would wait a year,\" Martinez added.. Some passengers aren't sure if they'll cruise again. Maurice Harold and his wife, Cynthia Harold, not only had to endure being adrift, they had to do so without some of their own clothes, medicines and other items lost when their luggage went into the water while being loaded onto the ship. \"It was pretty traumatic. It was a scary situation, said Cynthia Harold, who said she needs to use an oxygen machine while sleeping and was unable to after the ship lost power. \"I really haven't slept since I left Virginia Beach,\" she said.

Simpson, who caddied for his compatriot Neal Lancaster at a Pro-Am event ahead of the Greensboro tournament when he was a teenager, finished on 18-under-par, three-shots clear of fellow-American George McNeill. \"I really couldn't think of a better place to win than here in Greensboro,\" the 26-year-old told the PGA Tour's official web site. Simpson carded a bogey-free final round to seal his triumph and move into third position in the standings for the season-ending Fedex Cup. \"That was probably the most fun 18 holes I've ever been a part of,\" he said of Sunday's round. \"When I made the putt on 15, I asked my caddie for the first time all day, `Where do we stand?' and he said, `We're two ahead right now.' \"I knew I needed to play solid golf on the last three holes, and to birdie 16 was so huge. ... I knew I had a three-shot lead on 18, and as soon as I hit the ball in play, I knew it was probably over.\" McNeill's final round of 64 was only enough to get him to 15-under, but the 35-year-old was satisfied with his form during the competition. \"I can only control myself,\" McNeill said. \"I can't control what everybody else does. I'm very happy with the way I hit it, the way I played, the way I putted.\" Former world number one and three-time major winner Vijah Singh finished in a five-way tie for fourth position, one-shot behind American Tommy Gainey on 14-under.

      "context": "Washington (CNN) -- The Pentagon is making detailed plans to send about 34,000 more U.S. troops to Afghanistan in anticipation of President Obama's decision on the future of the eight-year-old war, a defense official said Tuesday. Obama held a lengthy meeting with top advisers Monday night and said Tuesday that he would announce plans for Afghanistan after the Thanksgiving holiday. A Defense Department official with direct knowledge of the process said there has been no final word on the president's decision. But planners have been tasked with preparing to send 34,000 additional American troops into battle with the expectation that is the number Obama is leaning toward approving, the official said. Obama ordered more than 20,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in March. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, reportedly has called for up to 40,000 more to wage a counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban, the Islamic militia originally ousted by the U.S. invasion in 2001. The president has weighed several options for bolstering the American contingent, ranging from sending a few thousand troops to sending the 40,000 McChrystal requested. McChrystal was among those who took part in Monday's conference with Obama and other top advisers, which broke up at 10 p.m. Vice President Joe Biden, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm. Michael Mullen and Karl Eikenberry, the U.S. ambassador in Kabul, were among the other senior officials in the meeting. Obama said Tuesday that the deliberations have been \"comprehensive and extremely useful.\" \"It's going to be important to recognize that in order for us to succeed there, you've got to have a comprehensive strategy that includes civilian and diplomatic efforts,\" he said at a news conference Tuesday with visiting Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The military has planning under way to send these units: three U.S. Army brigades, totaling about 15,000 troops; a Marine brigade with about 8,000 troops; a headquarters element of about 7,000; and between 4,000 and 5,000 support troops -- a total of approximately 34,000 troops, according to a defense official with direct knowledge of Pentagon operations. CNN reported last month that this was the preferred option within the Pentagon. The troops would be dispatched throughout Afghanistan but would be focused mainly on the southern and southeastern provinces, where much of the recent fighting has taken place. Currently, brigades from Fort Drum in upstate New York and Fort Campbell in Kentucky are among those that are next in line to deploy. About 68,000 U.S. troops are in Afghanistan, along with about 45,000 from the NATO alliance. Two U.S. military officials said NATO countries would be asked to contribute more troops to fill the gap between the 34,000 the Pentagon expects Obama to send and the 40,000 McChrystal wanted. The request is expected to come during a December 7 meeting at the alliance's headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. Pentagon spokesman Geoff Morrell would not discuss specific numbers, but he said NATO would be asked for additional help. \"Clearly, if the president decides to commit additional forces to Afghanistan, there would be an expectation that our allies would also commit additional forces,\" Morrell said. U.S.-led troops invaded Afghanistan in response to the al Qaeda terrorist network's September 11 attacks on New York and Washington. The invasion overthrew the Taliban, which had allowed al Qaeda to operate from its territory, but most of the top al Qaeda and Taliban leadership escaped the onslaught. Taliban fighters have since regrouped in the mountainous region along Afghanistan's border with Pakistan, battling U.S. and Afghan government forces on one side and Pakistani troops on the other. Al Qaeda's top leaders, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, remain at large and are suspected to be hiding in the same region. The conflict has claimed the lives of more than 900 Americans and nearly 600 allied troops. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll released Tuesday suggests that the U.S public is split over whether more troops should be sent to Afghanistan. Fifty percent of those polled said they would support such a decision, with 49 percent opposed. The poll found that 66 percent of Americans believe the war is going badly, up 11 percentage points from a similar survey in March. Overall support for the war has fallen to 45 percent, with 52 percent opposed. iReporters sound off; share your views on sending more troops in Afghanistan . Afghanistan was among the topics Obama and Singh discussed in their meetings Tuesday. Singh said the international community needs \"to sustain its engagement in Afghanistan, to help it emerge as a modern state.\" \"The forces of terrorism in our region pose a grave threat to the entire civilized world and have to be defeated,\" he said. \"President Obama and I have decided to strengthen our cooperation in the area of counterterrorism.\" India is one Afghanistan's biggest international donors, contributing $1.2 billion in aid. That involvement has been met with suspicion in Pakistan, India's nuclear rival in South Asia. But it has helped the United States by sharing some of the burden of stabilizing the country and providing civilian support. In addition, several leading analysts have argued that settling the decades-old tensions between India and Pakistan would allow both sides to pull troops off their borders, giving Pakistan more resources to battle the Taliban along its northwest frontier. \"I think that will certainly be at the center of the agenda this week,\" Nicholas Burns, a former State Department official, said on CNN's \"American Morning.\" U.S. prospects in Afghanistan depend partly \"on convincing Pakistan to be more cooperative in the fight against those terrorist groups.\" \"The United States is not going to be an outright mediator between Pakistan and India, but we can quietly, behind the scenes, push them to reduce their problems,\" Burns said. CNN's Elaine Quijano and Mike Mount contributed to this report.",

      "context": "(CNN) -- A blast of Arctic air Tuesday morning has much of the nation -- from the Great Lakes to Oregon and down to Texas -- in its cold, icy grip. Snow covers a golf course in Summerlin, Nevada, near Las Vegas, on Monday. The temperature at International Falls, Minnesota, was 26 below zero at 8 a.m. Tuesday, the National Weather Service said. To the south in Minneapolis, below-zero temperatures were leaving roadways covered in black ice, sending drivers spinning into numerous accidents, CNN affiliate KARE-TV reported Tuesday. Black ice, nearly invisible on roads, can form when car exhaust freezes on snow-covered pavement in sub-zero conditions, KARE said. Twin Cities drivers could find a little hope in the day's forecast high -- 4 degrees above zero by the afternoon. Temperatures hovering as low as 23 below zero have parts of Montana frozen in their tracks, according to CNN affiliate KFBB-TV. The forecast high Tuesday for Great Falls: 5 degrees. But regions of the nation far from Montana, and not as well equipped to deal with wintry weather, are also caught in the cold blast.  Watch the mess in Portland, Oregon \u00bb . WFAA-TV in Dallas, Texas, predicts the temperature will barely get above freezing, to 36 degrees, on Tuesday. A winter weather advisory is in effect for northern Texas. In Las Vegas, Nevada, residents saw a rare snow accumulation. Snow-covered grounds were a treat for iReporter Rena Moretti, who's lived in Las Vegas on and off for about 10 years. \"It's unbelievable. If it snows it never sticks. I've never seen it like that,\" she said.   Watch snow delight skiers but frustrate motorists in Nevada \u00bb  In Denver, Colorado, where the temperature was minus 4, KMGH warned residents to expect more snow, with 2 to 3 feet expected in some parts of the Rocky Mountains.  Watch ice cause havoc on Colorado roads \u00bb . While the snow is forecast to end Tuesday, the cold air mass should stick around all week. The station also warned commuters that driving would be a mess Tuesday morning. In Omaha, Nebraska, the frigid weather had shelters sending out crews looking for the homeless, according to KMTV.  Watch blizzards shut down North Dakota \u00bb . \"We've had people that have been trying to make it here ... either have been too intoxicated or just too cold and just fallen down and haven't been able to make it,\" says Siena Francis House worker and guest Jerry Rayburn. According to the National Weather Service, the entire state of Iowa could be in for heavy snowfall Tuesday. Chicago, Illinois, no stranger to cold weather, is expecting a high of 22 degrees with snow, according to WGN. Meanwhile, on a frontal boundary, West Virginia and western Tennessee are on the alert for possible freezing rain, the weather service reports.

Debris-clogged roads were blamed. \"They're passable for vehicles and emergency vehicles, but they're not passable for buses. That represents a danger, so, we can't get the kids safely to school, even if we were able to open school,\" School Superintendent Loxi Joe Calmes said, accoding to WCVB. Meanwhile, a cold, wet storm blew into Southern California. Twenty-four-hour rainfall totals were 1.44 inches at Los Angeles International Airport, almost 1 inch in Palm Springs, and an inch in San Diego, the weather service reported Tuesday morning. iReporters share their weather observations .
