    "- Distal clavicle fractures accompanied by complete coracoclavicular ligament rupture are classified as biomechanically unstable, with non-surgical management linked to elevated rates of pseudarthrosis. In contrast, partial ligament tears maintain some structural integrity and should be differentiated from complete disruptions that identify a rare and unstable fracture cohort.\n\n- Surgical intervention typically involves the application of acromioclavicular joint spanning devices (e.g., clavicle hook plate) to counteract tensile forces through subacromial leverage; however, these implants can incite subacromial pathologies, potentially affecting postoperative outcomes. Alternatively, acromioclavicular joint-preserving apparatus (e.g., locking distal radius plates) paired with coracoclavicular fixation via suture anchors or endobutton devices has been proposed to mitigate these complications.\n\n- This retrospective study evaluated the clinico-radiological outcomes of surgical management for distal clavicle fractures with complete coracoclavicular ligament disruption, focusing on fracture morphology and comminution patterns. Inclusion criteria encompassed acute, non-comminuted and comminuted lateral clavicle fractures with confirmed complete ligament disruptions, while cases with partial ruptures or existing shoulder pathologies were excluded.\n\n- The analysis revealed that radiographic union occurred in 93.3% of cases, with significant differences in reoperation rates (90% for joint-spanning vs. 0% for joint-sparing) and variations in clinical outcomes, although none reached statistical significance. Complications such as acromioclavicular joint degeneration and subacromial osteolysis were more prevalent in the joint-spanning cohort, indicating a potential advantage for joint-sparing techniques in clinical practice.",
    "- Distal clavicle fractures linked to coracoclavicular ligament disruptions present unique challenges, with non-surgical approaches often yielding less than ideal outcomes, prompting a closer look at surgical interventions.  \n- While some ligament disruptions maintain a degree of stability, complete disruptions lead to a notably more challenging scenario, necessitating thoughtful surgical planning and technique selection.  \n- Two distinct surgical methods were explored: one involving traditional joint-spanning implants and the other utilizing more innovative joint-sparing options combined with additional fixation techniques, each presenting their own set of advantages and considerations.  \n- The study aimed to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these approaches through a thorough analysis of patient outcomes, revealing nuances in recovery and potential for reoperation that merit further exploration.
