    "- While working at a manufacturing plant, I mistakenly loaded a coil of stock with the burr facing the wrong way, affecting the flattening process.  \n- I compounded the issue by using only two banding straps instead of three, causing the coil to twist when I tried to move it.  \n- This resulted in the need to rewind a $1200, 2000ft coil by hand, as scrapping it was not an option.  \n- After two and a half hours of effort, I had to return to work as my lunch break ended.
