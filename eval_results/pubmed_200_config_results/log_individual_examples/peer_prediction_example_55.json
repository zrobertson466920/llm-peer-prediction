\n in skin , caspase-14 is expressed only in the differentiating and cornifying layers of the epidermis and the hair follicle ( lippens et al . , 2000 ; \n this is consistent with the observation that , in vitro , caspase-14 is only expressed in differentiating but not in proliferating keratinocytes ( lippens et al . \n remarkably , nail matrix keratinocytes that differentiate into specialized nail corneocytes , the building blocks of the nail plate , do not express caspase-14 ( jager et al . \n in addition , caspase-14 is not expressed in the noncornifying keratinocytes of the sweat gland or the mouth epithelium ( lippens et al . , 2000 ; \n ultrastructural analysis demonstrated that spatial distribution of caspase-14 in the epidermis and hair follicles is strongly conserved among several mammalian species ( alibardi et al . \n caspase-14 was found to be associated with the nucleus , the keratohyalin granules , and the desmosomes , whereas in corneocytes , caspase-14 was found in the cytoplasm and was associated with corneodesmosomes ( a modified version of desmosomes ) and nuclear remnants . \n these observations suggested a role for caspase-14 in nuclear degradation during cornification , but nuclear degradation was not affected in caspase-14deficient mice ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) . \n the expression of caspase-14 in the hassall 's bodies of the thymus and in the forestomach of rodents is somewhat expected , as they are cornifying structures and express the typical late differentiation markers , such as profilaggrin and loricrin , which are also found in the epidermis ( laster and haynes , 1986 ; favre , 1989 ; jarnik et al . , 1996 ) . \n protein expression of caspase-14 has also been reported in several noncornifying tissues ( lippens et al . , 2003 ; krajewska et al . , 2004 , 2005 ; kam et al . , 2005 \n however , these observations should be interpreted carefully , as we have recently shown that the reported expression of caspase-14 in such tissues can be the result of aspecific staining ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) . \n remarkably , so far caspase-14 has been found only in terrestrial mammals but not in birds or reptiles . \n whereas birds and reptiles have a stiff , dry , scaly epidermis , mammals have a soft stratum corneum because of the larger amounts of histidine - rich late differentiation markers ( e.g. , profilaggrin ; alibardi , 2003 ) . \n interestingly , profilaggrin is a direct substrate of caspase-14 ( denecker et al . , 2007 ) . \n this could indicate that the occurrence of a soft stratum corneum and the caspase-14 gene are associated during evolution . \n although the expression of caspase-14 is very restricted , little is known about the transcriptional regulation of its gene . in vitro \n , caspase-14 is only expressed when keratinocytes are forced to differentiate by growing them postconfluently or in suspension or by adding vitamin d3 ( eckhart et al . \n in contrast , adding ca at high concentrations to the medium , a method frequently used to induce differentiation , did not induce caspase-14 expression ( eckhart et al . \n retinoids , which suppress keratinocyte differentiation , down - regulate caspase-14 expression ( rendl et al . , \n these results indicate that transcription factors that are specifically active during terminal differentiation are required to regulate caspase-14 expression . whether caspase-14 expression levels can be regulated at the posttranscriptional level is not known . \n down - regulation of several differentiation - associated genes by retinoids has been shown to be mediated by the transrepression of activator protein 1 ( ap-1)mediated gene activation ( fisher and voorhees , 1996 ) . \n indeed , the caspase-14 promoter contains at least two potential ap-1binding sites ( unpublished data ) . \n the green tea phenol ( )-epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( egcg ) is a potent activator of ap-1 and has been shown to up - regulate caspase-14 in a p38- and jnk - dependent way ( hsu et al . , 2005 , 2007 ) . \n ap-1 alone is probably not sufficient to drive caspase-14 expression because tnf and 12-o - tetradecanoyl - phorbol 13-acetate , two potent activators of ap-1 in keratinocytes ( arnott et al . , 2002 ) \n , did not induce caspase-14 expression in keratinocytes ( lippens et al . , 2004 ) . \n differentiation - dependent expression of caspase-14 in keratinocytes could also result from a strong transcriptional repression in proliferating keratinocytes . \n this possibility is supported by the observation that mice deficient in nuclear receptor corepressor hairless ( hr ) had 510-fold higher levels of caspase-14 and profilaggrin mrna , starting from postnatal day 6 and progressing during development ( zarach et al . , 2004 ) . \n these alterations in gene expression were detected mainly in the keratinocytes of the utricle , an abnormal pouch - like structure at the upper part of the hair follicle . increased \n gene expression occurred before the morphologically distinct utricle could be identified , indicating that the up - regulation was probably a cause rather than a consequence of utricle formation \n . it would be interesting to analyze both caspase-14 activation and filaggrin processing in these mice . \n multiple mutant hr alleles in mice and in humans show phenotypic variations that include congenital hair loss , skin wrinkling , and papular rash ( cichon et al . , 1998 ; \n 1998 ) . whether caspase-14 overexpression is important for the observed phenotypes could be addressed by generating epidermis - specific caspase-14 transgenic mice or by crossing the hr mice with caspase-14deficient mice . \n procaspases consist of a prodomain , a large subunit ( p20 ) , and a small subunit ( p10 ) . \n activation of caspases is induced by dimerization , ( auto-)proteolytic cleavage at asp residues , and/or conformational changes ( lamk...",
