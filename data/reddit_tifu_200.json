    "input": "this actually happened a couple of years ago. i grew up in germany where i went to a german secondary school that went from 5th to 13th grade (we still had 13 grades then, they have since changed that). my school was named after anne frank and we had a club that i was very active in from 9th grade on, which was dedicated to teaching incoming 5th graders about anne franks life, discrimination, anti-semitism, hitler, the third reich and that whole spiel. basically a day where the students' classes are cancelled and instead we give them an interactive history and social studies class with lots of activities and games. \n\nthis was my last year at school and i already had a lot of experience doing these project days with the kids. i was running the thing with a friend, so it was just the two of us and 30-something 5th graders. we start off with a brief introduction and brainstorming: what do they know about anne frank and the third reich? you'd be surprised how much they know. anyway after the brainstorming we do a few activities, and then we take a short break. after the break we split the class into two groups to make it easier to handle. one group watches a short movie about anne frank while the other gets a tour through our poster presentation that our student group has been perfecting over the years. then the groups switch. \n\ni'm in the classroom to show my group the movie and i take attendance to make sure no one decided to run away during break. i'm going down the list when i come to the name sandra (name changed). a kid with a boyish haircut and a somewhat deeper voice, wearing clothes from the boy's section at a big clothing chain in germany, pipes up. \n\nnow keep in mind, these are all 11 year olds, they are all pre-pubescent, their bodies are not yet showing any sex specific features one would be able to see while they are fully clothed (e.g. boobs, beards,...). this being a 5th grade in the rather conservative (for german standards) bavaria, i was confused. i looked down at the list again making sure i had read the name right. look back up at the kid. \n\nme: \"you're sandra?\"\n\nkid: \"yep.\"\n\nme: \"oh, sorry. *thinking the kid must be from somewhere where sandra is both a girl's and boy's name* where are you from? i've only ever heard that as a girl's name before.\"\n\nthe class starts laughing. sandra gets really quiet. \"i am a girl...\" she says. some of the other students start saying that their parents made the same mistake when they met sandra. i feel so sorry and stupid. i get the class to calm down and finish taking attendance. we watch the movie in silence. after the movie, when we walked down to where the poster presentation took place i apologised to sandra. i felt so incredibly terrible, i still do to this day. throughout the rest of the day i heard lots of whispers about sandra. i tried to stop them whenever they came up, but there was no stopping the 5th grade gossip i had set in motion.\n\nsandra, if you're out there, i am so incredibly sorry for humiliating you in front of your class. i hope you are happy and healthy and continue to live your life the way you like. don't let anyone tell you you have to dress or act a certain way just because of the body parts you were born with. i'm sorry if i made you feel like you were wrong for dressing and acting differently. i'm sorry i probably made that day hell for you. i'm sorry for my ignorance.",

    "input": "it was last october, but i'm feeling the fall-out from it the most today.  \n\nafter my mom died from cancer last year, i started looking for my estranged father.  i had only known him for a short time when i was 6 and barely remembered more than his name.  i never knew why he left and my mom would not talk about him without obvious emotional pain, so i didn't push her for information about him.  i figured he didn't care about us.\n\ni had googled him multiple times over the years, but he was always unlisted and i didn't have an address with which to search.  after her death, i felt strongly that he should at least know that she died and that i have a beautiful little girl.  it felt wrong that he might be out there somewhere knowing nothing about us.\ni googled him again and came up with a phone number and address that seemed realistic.  i called, figuring it was going to be another person by the same name since i'd already experienced that several times while looking for him.  it wasn't.\n\ni had no idea how he would react to me, but he was ecstatic.  he told me that he had been a horrible alcoholic and that he didn't pursue custody of me because he felt himself to be selfish and unstable.  he said he knew that my mom and my family would love me and take wonderful care of me (he was right about that!  my mom was the best woman i've ever known).\n\nso, we started talking and skyping.  we spent a lot of time learning about each other. knowing how he had hurt my mom and bailed on me made it difficult to see him as the person he has grown to be, but i tried to believe that people can change for the better.  \n\nhe was exactly everything i needed in a father my entire life:  supportive, sweet, funny, loving.  eventually, i told him that i loved him after months of talking with him.  he was over-the-moon.\n\nfast-forward to actually meeting him in person.  this is the part where, without knowing my dad or me, you might feel that i sound like an ass.  i say this because i don't have a precise reason or event that i can point to as to why i don't trust him.  why he actually makes me really nervous.\n\nmy dad is really touchy and hovers all of the time.  he doesn't smell clean and his teeth are rotting and crumbled.  he doesn't give personal space and, when i spent a couple of nights staying at his trailer, he kept coming in to my room to check on me while i was sleeping.  he said that he was just so excited to have me there that he couldn't help it, but i really felt uncomfortable with it.  i couldn't sleep and was so glad that i didn't even consider bringing my daughter without spending time with him first.\n\nhe also asked me if he could kiss me on the mouth because his family does.  i said \"no\" and he accepted that, but the constant touchiness continued.  it wasn't anything strictly inappropriate, but it made my skin crawl.  \ni've spent very little actual time with him in person, maybe 2 weeks total over several trips.  i have, however, talked with him for countless hours on the phone and skype.  \n\nduring the most acute months of grieving for my mom, he was so devoted to me, trying to talk me through whatever he could.  i was so grateful for it that i kept ignoring details about his character that really concerned me.  he actually demanded a lot of my time, like hours and hours every day and would get upset if i cited my daughter and husband as reasons that i needed to chill with the phone.  he never paid my mom child support and obviously was never there for us my entire life.  he also evaded taxes and told me he had been to court 9 times and jail once.  \n\nagain, i know people can change, but at this point, i find myself wanting less contact with him.  the idea of him spending any time with my daughter alone is out of the question and my husband feels the same concerns.  i don't want to hurt him, but i just can't trust him.  i don't even know if i'm asking for advice or confessing to being stupid and rushing into something that will hurt someone.\n\nthank you for reading and i sincerely want to wish all the wonderful father's out there a very happy father's day!\n\neta:",

(btw fuck you grammer nazi's because i dont care about my punctuation) i decide that im going to be crafty...so i grab it and sneak behind my mother and yell loudly that i was the salad ninja and stole a bite. now as this happens she turns and looks at me with dissapointment  in her eyes as she yells \"stay off my fu-.......\" and at that moment she looks up at me and gasps that she cant breathe and needs help. so i do what i think the fucking heimlich maneuver is, which wasnt pretty at all, and fail horribly and start yelling for her to breathe because it was all i could think to do and this woke my step-dad. at this moment i realized she was coughing which means she was breathing to some extent. my stepdad rolls in the kitchen and tries to pull off his version of the heimlich maneuver as well which also wasnt pretty at all. and after some trial and error he looks at me realizing she is breathing as well sort of saying \"what the hell are we in here doing as far as i know shes fine.\" then he looks back down at her only to look up again and stare into my eyes as if he is looking at my soul or something for at least 15 seconds which felt like a year or something. then my wife comes down the stairs and she starts freaking out and calls the ambulance and i realize why she was shocked as i saw the puddle of blood coming from my mothers mouth. the squad showed up and they asked questions like her name and other various things a squad would ask before packing her up in the gurney and rolling out to the hospital. my step-dad left shortly after and i havnt seen or heard from them yet. although i had a terrible realization just a few minutes ago...\n\ni would like to start off by saying that my step-fathers half mexican daughter is coming to ohio tomorrow to see her father for the first time in her life.

    "input": "the nofap community recommended i post this to r/tifu\n\n###how r/nofap ruined my only chance at a potential relationship \n    \n\na couple months ago, i went on a 2nd date with a girl from okcupid. originally we planned to go snowtubing but the snow had melt. instead she invites me over for dinner. i get there, it's just us and it\u2019s going really good. but then, her roommate and his mom shows up. we all hang out and play board games. now her roommate\u2019s mom is really hot, (and since i was 21 days nofap) i decide to playfully flirt with the mom. the mom is totally into it. it gets late though, and she eventually leaves. it's only me, my date and her roommate left. i suppose her roommate didn't enjoyed me flirting with his mom because i was cock-blocked the rest of the night. \n    \n\nat about 12:30am, we're all very tired and the roommate asks if i'm going to spend the night, (*awkward*). so, they set me up in the \"guest loft\" which is an alcove/cubby about 6 feet off the ground right next to this girls room. i'm so exhausted that i just crash instead of waiting up for her to finish brushing her teeth (i should have waited). i\u2019m asleep in this guest loft, right next to this girl's room and i start having crazy sexual dreams. one of the dreams is so intensely sexual that i wake up right away realizing something bad. i look down and see that i justed blasted about 21 days worth of jizz into my underwear (wet dream).\n    \n\ni think \u201choly fuck this is bad - you can't get invited to a girls house and then jizz all over her guest room bed.\u201d i'm freaking out, perhaps i should just run out to my car, leave and never return. i don't know what else to do. so i decide that is my plan. it\u2019s really cold outside and i remember that my sweatshirt is on the floor next to the bed. so i lean over the bed head-first to grab my sweatshirt... except, i totally forgot that i\u2019m in a loft. i end up diving head first down a 6 foot drop.\n    \n\nat the last moment, i catch myself on a panel of wood and cabinet. unfortunately i break both of them, cracking the wall and causing a giant banging sound. now i'm fucked, i just jizzed all over the place broke her cabinet and the wall, everyone must have heard it! so i run to the bathroom in my sticky underwear while carrying my jeans. finally some good luck. it\u2019s looks as if all the jizz stayed in my underwear. but now i have to figure out what to do with a destroyed pair of underwear. do i try to hide it somewhere? where? they must have heard the crash. they are probably right outside looking to see what happened. i quickly ball up the underwear and shove it down my pants. i go back to the bed and no one is there?!. i look around for jizz evidence. i can't find any, but its dark (i'm like 90% sure that it all stayed in my underwear!) now my only concern is the smell. i mean, c'mon it's 21 days\u2019 worth of cum. and, she's sleeping, at most,  15 ft away in her room.\n    \n\nanyways, i start to get tired, think *screw it* (she lived 45 min away, it's not like it was a coworker and i would be permanent known as the creep who masturbates all over your guest room while you sleep). so i laydown and fall back asleep. i wake up to sounds of the girl moving around the house. she goes downstairs, so i have quickly make the bed while looking for any cum stains (i didn't see any!). i put all my clothes on while she comes back up the stairs. she jokes about how i'm trying to break her house into pieces. all of a sudden, in slowmotion, i see her nostrils flair. she is starting to smell the jizz! i quickly make some excuse about having to grab some mouthwash from my car. i run out to the and secretly pull the underwear out of my pants and stash it. now, i made it thus far. i decide to push my luck,  i come back into the house and we hang out for like 2 hours, nothing awkward at all. \n\ni spent all the next day waiting for a text message: \"did you cum all over the guest loft?\"",

    "input": "ok, so this happened a couple weeks ago in my research lab. this might be a little confusing if you aren't a scientist or chemist, but i'll try to make it readable for you non-scientists out there. btw, i am an undergraduate researcher, so you can imagine some of the stupidity that will ensue.\n\ni work in a lab that tries to make crystals to see if a unique chemical structure is formed. one time i was using ethanol (alcohol) as a solvent for my reaction, and i knew that the product formed from the reaction would not crystallize with ethanol, so i had to vaporize the ethanol out of the solution by heating the solution beaker on a hot plate. once the ethanol was vaporized, i was left with the product in the hot/warm beaker. \n\nnow this is an aside, for some reason or another the graduate tas and research educator prof i work with in the lab do not use the vent (hood) for many dangerous chemicals, like dichloromethane. maybe its because they find it inconvenient to work in the hood or maybe its because they work with dichloromethane so much they kinda forget about its dangers. so i thought since they don't use a hood when using dichloromethane, then maybe i don't need to, for the sake of \"efficiency\" (stupid mistake, very stupid). \n\nin case you don't know the dangers of dichloromethane: the first thing you have to know is that it is potentially carcinogenic. the second thing is that if you inhale/consume enough of it, then you can/will get carbon monoxide poisoning because dichloromethane is metabolized into carbon monoxide. carbon monoxide poisoning can lead to temporary blindness/blurriness. the third thing is that dichloromethane has a relatively low boiling point temperature (point at which the liquid turns into a gas that you can breathe).\n\nnow that the solid product is in my hot/warm beaker with no liquid ethanol, i am supposed to dissolve the product in dichloromethane, so that it will crystallize in a couple days. ok, so here's when things go outta hand. i start to add dichloromethane into the beaker, and i notice that the dichloromethane was vaporizing, like when you add water to hot skillet when you are washing it after you used it on the stove. i thought, no big deal, i do this all the time to cool down pots and stuff at home, no harm done? wrong! the next second, i took a normal breath of air. and my lungs sank like an anvil dropping to the bottom of an ocean. i realized what i had just done to myself. i, immediately, put the beaker into a vent (hood), and started breathing heavy to try and get as much dichloromethane out of my system as possible. i knew it was too late, but then i assured myself that i didn't breathe too much because i only put in like a couple mls of dichloromethane into the beaker. i left lab and went outside for like 30 minutes, and thankfully i didn't feel any strong effects due to the dichloromethane, except for blurriness in my eyes for a couple minutes (i think the blurriness may have come from the placebo effect of knowing the side effects of inhaling dichloromethane b/c i was thinking of that first).\n\ni think i am lucky to be alive. reddit, tifu, and plan on not fucking up again in lab by being a shit ton more safe, rather than being \"efficient\".",

the best thing i had done to date! i was a 26 year old who never had a serious girlfriend, but i got girls on a frequent basis, but this kiss topped everything! we spent the night together, and i asked her to date me, but she said she couldn't, that she was still getting over her previous boyfriend of two years, but i persisted over the next couple of months, and she finally agreed. so begins the first of my f ups, in a long, drawn out series of them. i should have let her heal and recuperate, but that's not what i wanted. i told myself that i could make it better. my ego so sayeth.\n\nwe went on our first date the day after i got out of the navy, and she loved it! she said it was still the best date she'd ever been on the last time i talked to her, and it showed. she was glowing and beaming! a non-stop smile the entire evening! and that's how she made it the best date i've ever been on: to this day i can't remember if she walked at all that night. i only have recollections of her floating, which isn't the first time this has happened. the first time i saw her after my last deployment, she floated into the room with a flowing white summer dress and red lipstick. in my mind, she's always floating, while smiling and laughing. and the times when i woke up next to her, with the sunlight casting a halo around her, she would wake up and comment about her hair being whacky, but i never saw anything more beautiful than in those moments. she would then get ready for school or work and come downstairs, which turned out to be my daily fashion show, were it played out like the scene in every teenage prom movie, and in my mind she slowly walked down the stairs and lit up my whole world. these were the best days of my life, but i mistakenly never told her.\n\nafter that, it was a steady downhill slide. i got out of the navy early with two weeks notice, which didn't give me any time to look for a job.  i was collecting unemployment, but it was barely enough to cover the mortgage on my un-rented house, let alone all of the other bills i had. i was living off of my credit card, and worried that i was going to lose my house. i went back and forth from my place, trying to get it ready to rent out, to her, trying to keep this fledgling relationship afloat, and my parents' place, 4 hours away from her, 7 from my house, trying to mooch off of them to save money. on top of all of this, i was steadily getting rejected after job interviews, sliding me further and further into a funk. i was depressed, my ego didn't think it was possible for these jobs to not want me. and this girl made me want to be the best i could be, so that i could be the best for her, but my unemployment status was preventing this. i knew i could be better for her, but while lamenting, i was not a good boyfriend.\n\nafter all of this, she thought it was best that we break up. i agreed, being that it wasn't a great time for either of us, and we mutually parted as friends. we kept in contact for a couple of months, until i took her out for her birthday, when the majority of my monumental f ups take place.\n\nwe went to an '80's dance party with a bunch of her friends, where she was showing me the classic signs of attraction: touching, paying specific attention to me, but i thought nothing of it. the last sure thing she said relationship related to me was that she thought i was great, but that she was happy being alone. she made it clear and obvious that night that she was attracted to me, but i was too thick-headed to get it. we spent that next couple of weeks hanging out, and she would show me all of the obvious signs, but i would either brush them off or not realize it until later, sometimes right after we parted.\n\nthis is where my ego takes control and ruins it: i convince myself that i'm just confused by her, and that if she wants me to ask her out, she has to say something. make no mistake, this is solely my ego and arrogance licking its' wounds and demanding to be soothed, pacified and satiated. i recognized the signs, but ignored them, for this stupid reason.\n\nshe then moved into a new apartment, and invites me to her housewarming party. while there, she showers me with attention, ignores other guys and often shrugs them off for me, but this isn't good enough for me and my ego. oh, no, we want retribution! i even literally pushed her away from me at one point, but this sweet thing shrugs that off and comes right back to me. it seems to me like everything is finally falling into place, but it never does. she never gives my ego the satisfaction it craves, and i sleep alone that night.\n\nthe next couple of months go by, and our interactions slowly decrease. i'm sure she's hurt by the constant rejection i'm dishing out, as a girl of this caliber should never be. however, my ego's cravings for satisfaction seem to become almost manic. she's not appeasing it, so i look for other outlets, mostly girls picked up at a bar somewhere. this gives me a false sense of entitlement, almost, or that i could get any girl i wanted, and that it was just a matter of time before she gave me what i wanted.\n\nshe then invites me to her friends' birthday party, an '80's prom themed dance party. i was named prom king. i only mention this because at first it seemed trivial, but i now realize that it just furthered my opinion of myself, and that i was going to get what i wanted, but nothing was further from the truth. at this party, she is ignoring me, and is all over someone else. i couldn't comprehend this. i was distraught, to say the least. other girls at the party showed interest in me, but to me there was only one, and she couldn't care less for me.\n\nafter a night of drinking, she goes to her room to pass out. i still care deeply for her, being that she's the first girl i ever had, so i went to find out if she was ok. i woke her up, asked her is she wanted some water, at which point her new guy is there, and he gives it to her. her room mate shows up, then she passes out and we leave. we wake up the next morning, and i go to sit by her bed, but she again passes out and i leave. at the time, neither of these incidents seemed to be a big deal, but they would come back to haunt me a week later.\ni go up to my parents' for a week, and the whole time i'm wondering what had happened, when it dawned on me that it was my ego that was driving me to hurt this beautiful lilly of a girl, and that i should just suck it up and ask her out, despite the most recent events. i was even talking and joking with her for a week, and we made plans to hang out when i returned.\n\nwhen i got into town, she wouldn't return my texts or answer my calls. i didn't consider this a big deal, and tried calling and texting her over the next couple of days, all met with the same response. i didn't hear from her until she sent me a text saying that some one had told her i was watching her sleep at the party and that we couldn't hang out anymore! and that's the last time i heard from her.\n\nat first i was upset that i lost my chance with her, but then i realized that even though she is a rare breed, if she's one in a million, there are 35 of them in california, and that if i could attract a girl like that once, i could most certainly do it again. the one time my ego is helpful, and possibly right. but i was still hurt that she wouldn't allow me a confrontation, an explanation or defense. i wasn't angry, i just wanted to know what was going on, and i didn't want to start a fight, nor cause a rift between any friends. i just wanted to know if it was true, being that i was drinking, the mere mention of it makes it a possibility, and how convicted her and her friends have been. it didn't take me long to realize that this was again my ego, wanting to know why she accused me and believed that i could do something like that! but some simple objective reasoning answered that: she had to. i forced her hand and made her. why would she choose me, the egotistical, arrogant asshole who toyed with her emotions for months, over anybody that could have said that? she couldn't.\nit's my idea that there is no such thing as truth; that truth is just bent to the will of popular opinion. her truth, what she chooses to believe, because it is a choice, is that i did that, and that i'm a creepy douche. and that is all that matters.\n\ni don't believe that it happened, but that's what i choose to believe, which might be controlled by my ego again. however, i am so glad to have met a person like that in my life, and that she introduced me to the wonders of the opposite sex, and the wonders that a relationship can do for me. and i'm so glad for each new day, which is a second chance to live better than you did the previous.\n\n1st edit: i apologize for the lack of spacing, it was there in the draft, and this is my first post of this nature. as for the lack of tl;dr, as i said, i don't care if anybody reads this, i'm just venting. i've never told anybody this, and just writing it out has helped me tremendously, but here:",

strega.  apparently it's some italian thing with like 76 different ingredients.  it tasted like mouthwash with a burning kick in the throat afterwards.  i drank a couple shots, but my brother took a lot more.  his reasoning was \"well i traded one from my 6-pack, and so that was like $3 worth, so i deserve more!\"  i watched him chug at least 6 shots out of this thing, barely taking a breath.\n\nfast forward about 10 minutes.  we're playing werewolf, and i can tell that i'm being waaaaaaaay too obnoxious, and everyone wishes that i would leave.  except for the guy sitting next to me, apparently (this was the guy with the strega).  when \"nighttime\" comes and the village goes to sleep (we all lower our heads to simulate sleeping), he reaches over and grabs my cock.  i think i handled it very well.  i just gently removed his hand and said \"dude, there's kids here...\"\n\ni didn't want to embarrass the guy and it was kinda my fault (apparently i give off a really gay vibe when i'm this drunk), i have a lot of gay friends and i know it's hard (heheh, phrasing) to find similarly minded people, so when the villagers decided to lynch me that night i drunkenly excused myself and left the game.  the guy ended up leaving with his, now empty, bottle of booze. this caused me to miss what happened next.\n\nfrom my side of the room, i hear a splash and see about 20 people all stand up in unison, perform a perfectly in-synch 180, and jog away from the scene with a giant \"nope\" look on all their faces.  my brother had puked all over the game area.  with no other players remaining, he declared victory for the werewolves.\n\n15 minutes later, we're in the bathroom, and i'm telling him all the disgusting things i can think of to get him to throw up more.  these include things like,\n\n\"hey, let's go upstairs and get an ashtray sandwich!\"  or\n\n\"just think about going down on mom...\"\n\nthat one worked really well...  somewhere i have a video of him crying while puking and proclaiming \"stop, i'm vomiting tears!\"\n\nwith the help of one of the convention volunteers, we make it back to our rooms, where i pass out next to the door for about an hour.  i finally make it to bed around 6am, and sleep straight though to 2pm.  i awake to the worst hangover of my life.  i had to pound several energy drinks to get rid of the headache, but by 6pm or so i'm good.  my brother apparently had a similar experience in his room.\n\nwe decided not to continue our werewolf games on sunday, and kept ourselves from even showing our faces in the game room for the rest of the convention.\n\n** \n\n\n\n**part 2** - on monday, we're getting ready to leave the convention and we run into one of the guys that helped us out when we were both puking.  he told us that everyone completely forgot about saturday night because of what happened the next night.\n\n11pm or so, sunday night, down in the game room there were these two drunk guys.  they're being real assholes and are asked to leave the game.  they finally give in and get up, only to stick around because the one guy's gf showed up.  he picks her up, throws her on the table, lifts her skirt and starts doin it right there...  in front of a mixed crowd with ages ranging from 8 to 60.\n\napparently that's the line at this particular convention.  the con's security escorts them upstairs where the one guy is threatening to beat the shit out of the hotel manager, while the other declares that \"you can't hold us, i'm in the military!\"  so the security guy asks for their military ids.  he writes down the information and informs them that he'll be calling their cos.\n\nthe guys start freaking out.  security takes them out back into this little courtyard area while they wait for the head of security to show up.  guy starts picking up gravel and throwing it at the windows of the hotel.  he finally crossed the line when he took a chair and tried to pry to fire door open with one of the legs.  this set off the fire alarm.\n\nturns out that the fire department was already there, finishing up after a fire in the elevator on the 26th floor.  with that, the cops got involved.\n\n**tl:dr** -

(usually no ra ever even visits my floor, and the room is only inspected once per semester for safety).\n\nfortunately for me, the smoke alarm in my apartment is located in the bedroom, and i managed to air the place out without causing it to go off. \n\ni was lucky enough to survive the ordeal with nothing but an ashy kitchen, a burnt throat (it still hurts a little to breath in too deeply), and an apartment in which everything smells very pungently of smoke (this is the best part, because my clothes now all smell like a campfire).\n\nsomehow, in a very lucky turn of events, the pizza was okay.",

i was certainly able to move things around quicker from room to room, plus it was pretty fun. i ended up 2 hours later sat in front of the tv with some alphabetti spaghetti, too lazy to bother taking the skates off\u2026 when i heard a knock at the back door.\n\nnow here\u2019s where i should mention how my house is laid out. i was in the lounge sat in the armchair with my back to the window. my house kind of curves around and so if someone is at the backdoor, they would be standing right next to that window. in my old neighbourhood i wasn\u2019t used to people walking around to the back door unless they were friends. but this was a whole different place where people not only come round the back but walk into your house uninvited too as i had learned the few days previous when i nearly assaulted my poor elderly (albeit trespassing) neighbour who informed me that it\u2019s just what people do here?! so here is where i am fucked. someone is at my back door (which is open \u2013 inviting to these friendly trespassing neighbours) and here i am \u2013 a woman in her mid 20's sat in a furry dressing gown at midday eating alphabetti spaghetti with darth vadar rollerblades on. the person can see through the window, they can see my head, they know i\u2019m home. i can\u2019t ignore them. it\u2019s only a matter of time before they simply walk through the door and my bizarre recently adopted childish habits are revealed. \n\nok, what are my options? i\u2019m running out of time. i have to act fast. i looked down at my skates - both double tied with velcro and 4 straps. god damn these things would take way too long to remove. i had to consider my other options at this point.\n\nplan a. i can pretend to be a statue. if i stay really still they might think i\u2019m a mannequin or something. but then if they come in they will see a woman in her mid 20's not only wearing rollerblades but also pretending to be a statue. \n\nplan b? i can pretend to be deaf. could work although i\u2019d have to pretend to be deaf until i moved house which would require an awful lot of effort where i\u2019d have to learn sign language to keep up appearances. i\u2019m too lazy. next. \n\nplan c. man up? just man the fuck up, put down my plate of alphabetti spaghetti and skate over to that back door like i don\u2019t give a fuck. could work. they might think i\u2019m kooky and eccentric. it could become a humourus story among the neighbours about how carefree and hilarious i am. i could become elevated to high status within the community and all the old people would love me and bring me baked goods and i\u2019d never have to buy an oven. or more likely they think i\u2019m totally fucking weird and i become the outcast of the street and nobody would agree to take in my endless amazon orders while i\u2019m out. \n\nas i\u2019m scanning through increasingly bizarre solutions in my head i realise i\u2019ve wasted too much time. \u201chello?\u201d i hear a man say\u2026 from the kitchen. yes, the man has walked into the house and is now literally a few feet away from my feet. my plastic red and black wheel covered feet. so which option should i go for? a, b or c? i surprised myself and ended up going for a plan i didn\u2019t know existed until i chose it. plan d. get up as fast as you can and skate the fuck out of there before he sees. i don\u2019t know what stupid brain cell made me choose that option. as if i could fucking discreetly skate out of a room in which the man was now in the doorway, watching as a pink ball of fluff slams her skates across her hardwood floor to the other door into the next room in a desperate attempt to escape humiliation. there was no turning back now. he had seen. he had heard. he knew my secret and he knew i had tried to hide it from him. i couldn\u2019t go back and face him now. it\u2019s too late. it was over. i skated to the corner of the room and hid behind a box in vain hope he wouldn\u2019t follow me in. he didn\u2019t. instead he said \u201cuhm\u2026 just wanted to welcome you to the neighbourhood\u2026let me know if you need anything\u2026\u201d and left. and to add insult to injury, as i sat there among the boxes, deep with burning shame in my darth vadar life destroyers, he walked past the window and looked in and saw me. so... what am i gonna do about my amazon orders now?",

(points to the brush) ...she's sick.  i'm drunk.  you know where a gas station is?\"\n\ncop thinks about the situation, seems to make up his mind, and says, \"half a mile that way, there's a gas station that's open.\"\n\nhe practically runs to his squad car and hauls ass to get away.\n\ni stumble back to the car, forego the gas station, and drive home with no pants, covered in shit and diapers.  \n\ni was shocked that the cop didn't find me and give me a breathalyzer since my obviously drunk husband said i was \"sick,\" but my feeling is that the combined odor of booze, puke, and nuclear oktoberfest grease bomb shit threatened to make him puke, so he just got the fuck out of there instead of deal with whatever weird predicament he stumbled upon.\n\ni can see the headlines now... \"soiled woman wearing diapers arrested for possible dui.\"",

(i read the game and follow seddit and i'm thinking this shit is really working).  so she asks me if i want to grab a drink.  i let her know that i don't buy drinks for woman its against policy.  she's like its cool she can buy her own drinks.  (this makes me think its legit.)  so we have a couple of drinks and she's like there is a more private less loud bar around the corner where we can hear each other a bit better.  as soon as we starting heading away from bourbon street (fuck up number 2) alarms start going off in my head (ignoring alarm bells fuck up #3).  so i look at her and ask \"are you going to kill me?\"  she starts laughing and puts me at ease.  we head on.  at the back space bar we have a couple of more drinks (this time i broke my rule and paid....).  we are having a great conversation and i'm killing time so win win.  she says we should go to another bar where it where its a little more private.  \n\nso we move up the street the harem (fuck up #4 - yes these are the real names) and i think it says harlem because i asked her about it.  any way this joint looks shady as hell.  she's says it's fine and she starts having a conversation with the bar tender and i walk over and she tells me to go sit and she'll be over in a minute (i'm thinking this is strange but i'm wierdly disconnected from everything going on at this point - fuck up #5).  there is this really fit woman wearing something lacy with a weird white eye at the end of the bar and i'm thinking she looks scary and manish at the same.  any way she comes back over and we have a couple of more drinks.  she says she's horny and she wants to fool around (i'm like sweet i'm going to score two nights in a row and have to fr's for seddit i'm the fucking man).  she then says we can't go back to her hotel because her family is staying there and i'm like well bummer and good night because i got my friend sacked out in the room.  she says we can go and hook up in the hotel bath room (i'm not sure why this sounded like a good idea to me at the time (fuck up #???shit i lost count). so we head back to the hotel.  then she says we can't do it in the lobby bathroom we need to hit the bathroom in our room. edit:\ni'm pretty hesitant about this but she cajoles me into going (fuck up).  my friends in the room passed out so we get in the bathroom and she  says we should both wipe off since we been out and about for a bit.  this sounds reasonable.  so she wipes herself off and then wipes me off and starts blowing me (i'm standing in front of the door). its ok but not the best i've ever had. she says she wants to fuck now and get a condom.  i grab the condom and put it on and she flicks the light off (fuck up) and bends over the counter and hikes her skirt up.  the worst most rancid smell hits my nose, its like a fucking rotting corpse its so bad.  my dick starts withering. i'm flashing to a scene in trainspotting or the follow up porno where spud is fucking this drunk chick who had a dried turd in her panties and then i'm thinking how am i going to extricate myself from this situation when she grabs my junk and shoves it in.  i can't keep it up and she's asking me if her pussy aint good enough so i go to flick on the lights and she flicks them back off and spins be around and sits me on the toilet.  she pulls the condom off and starts blowing me again.  she asks if i have another condom and i don't.  she says she going to run to the vending machine and grab another condom and she'll be right back.  out she goes (fuck up). i'm sitting on the can reflecting on all this mighty relieved she's gone and it will be easier to extricate myself now that she isn't in the room.  so i'm sitting there thinking about how fucked up this has been.  i must have sat there for two minutes or when i get up and get dressed.  i'm like wait something is wrong here.  my pants aren't the right weight.  so i search my pockets and no galaxy g4.  fuck where the hell is my phone.  i search the bathroom, it isn't there.  fuck she stole my fucking phone.  \n\ni run down stairs.  way too late. she's long gone.  so i head straight to the lobby to use the phone and call the phone company to have my phone disabled.  once that's done i head to the business center to change all the passwords linked to the products on my phone.  i hit the bank up first.  as soon as i log in i see two withdrawals within the last 10 minutes totaling $600 (my daily limit).  i call the bank and then call the police.\n\nedit: \n\nthe police show up while i'm still in the business center resetting passwords.  of course they send two female officers and i'm like fuck now i got to tell these two woman what an asshole i am.  so i tell them the story.  i am completely honest about it and leave nothing out. then they accuse me of hiring a prostitute.  i'm completely flabbergasted.  i did not offer any money nor did she ask for any money.  then they ask me it was a man.  i said no but then she asked about the penetration again and when i said it was from behind they were like it was probably a dude.  now i'm totally disgusted, demoralized and shamed.  the one officer said my wife should divorce me and i'm like i'm already fucking divorced and wtf i'm the victim here.  she continued to berate me.  telling me she can't believe i did that when my friend was in the room and i totally put them at risk and on an on for like 10 minutes.  admittedly i deserve it but at the time it was just too soon.  she then reiterated that it was probably a dude because i never saw her vjj and did it from behind.  totally demoralized.  so all in all she* stole my phone, $600 , my dignity, pride, self respect and a piece of my soul.",
